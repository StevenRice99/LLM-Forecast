I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to relaxed socializing and mask-wearing among younger adults, asymptomatic individuals spreading infections, and exposure of older and more vulnerable people in crowded areas.
Considering these factors, I would add 50-75 hospitalizations to the original ARIMA forecast of 141. This adjustment is based on the assumption that the current low case numbers are a temporary trend and that the factors mentioned in Article 1 will lead to an increase in hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 191
