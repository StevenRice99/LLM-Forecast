I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, and 4 mention the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in long-term care homes, as well as the lack of comprehensive inspections.
2. Temporary workers can work at multiple facilities : Article 4 highlights a potential loophole that could facilitate the spread of the virus.
3. Decrease in infection control oversight : Articles 3 and 5 mention the decline in comprehensive inspections and RQIs, which could lead to undetected outbreaks.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for potential outbreaks in long-term care homes and other vulnerable settings. This will increase the predicted number of hospitalizations over the next 8 weeks.
 Adjusted Forecast: 4322
