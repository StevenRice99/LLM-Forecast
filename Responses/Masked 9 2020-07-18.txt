I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Based on the news articles, there are several factors that suggest a potential surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations:
 Article 1: A surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in several large US states, including Texas, California, and Florida.
 Article 4: A surge of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the Philippines, with private hospitals reaching full capacity for treating patients.
However, there are also factors that suggest a low risk for children contracting severe illness or hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Article 3).
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 100 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 9 weeks to account for potential surges in cases and hospitalizations.
The adjusted forecast is: 522
