I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the information from the news articles.
Considering Article 1, which reports stable or dropping COVID-19 trends in Ottawa, I will reduce the ARIMA forecast by 10% to account for the potential decrease in hospitalizations due to declining cases.
Considering Article 2, which suggests a possible indirect relationship between COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and alcohol-related health issues, I will increase the adjusted forecast by 5% to account for the potential impact of increased alcohol-related visits on healthcare systems.
Considering Article 3, which reports a family doctor shortage in Ontario, I will increase the adjusted forecast by another 10% to account for the potential increase in emergency-room visits and hospitalizations due to people without a regular family physician relying more heavily on emergency care.
The final adjusted forecast is: 2945
