I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
Considering the potential for a "twin-demic" of COVID-19 and flu in Ontario, Canada (Article 1), I expect an increase in hospitalizations due to respiratory failure if both viruses are contracted simultaneously.
The study mentioned in Article 2 highlights the high risk of hospitalization and death among young adults with underlying conditions. This suggests that the current surge may be more severe than initially predicted by ARIMA.
However, Article 3 indicates that schools have reopened, which could lead to an increase in cases among students and staff. But it also mentions that the median age of those contracting COVID-19 has decreased to 41 years old (Article 4), suggesting a shift towards younger people getting infected, which might lead to lower hospitalization rates compared to previous surges.
Taking these factors into account, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding an additional 100 hospitalizations over the next 9 weeks. This is based on the assumption that the "twin-demic" and the shift towards younger people getting infected may lead to a more severe surge than initially predicted.
The adjusted forecast: 522 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 9 weeks.
