I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent trends in Ontario, Canada.
Based on the news articles provided, I notice that:
 There are no COVID-19 patients in ICU at Brampton Civic Hospital (Article 3), which suggests a decrease in severe cases.
 Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang aims for a 90% student vaccination rate to avoid a fourth wave (Article 4), indicating an effort to prevent surges in hospitalizations.
Considering these trends, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast downward by 10% to account for the potential decrease in severe cases and the efforts to prevent a surge. This brings the adjusted forecast to:
185 - (0.1 x 185) = 166
So, my final answer is: 166
