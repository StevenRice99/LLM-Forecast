Based on the provided articles, I would say that the following information would not be captured in this data:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario (mentioned in Article 6)
 The exact strategies used by other hospitals in the GTA to manage COVID-19 cases (while Brampton Civic Hospital's strategies are discussed in detail, there is no mention of other hospitals' approaches)
 The demographics and health status of individuals who have experienced mild symptoms or asymptomatic infections (the articles focus on general trends and expert opinions rather than specific case studies)
However, if I had to choose one answer that would not be captured in this data, I would say:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario . This information is mentioned in Article 6 as a general statement ("Cases and hospitalizations have fallen precipitously across much of Canada..."), but no specific numbers are provided for Ontario.
