Here's a summary of the articles:
 Article 1: Ontario Exceeds 400 COVID Patients in ICU 
 The number of COVID patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has exceeded 400 in Ontario, with 412 ICU admissions reported.
 There are 2,419 total hospitalizations and 123 unvaccinated patients and 137 fully vaccinated patients currently in the ICU.
 Unvaccinated people make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 cases, with 457 unvaccinated individuals and 1,353 fully vaccinated individuals hospitalized.
 Article 2: Baricitinib for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 
 The Ontario Science Table has recommended the use of baricitinib in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
 Three scenarios are outlined:
 + Critically ill patients: Baricitinib may be considered in patients receiving non-invasive or high-flow nasal oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO who are on a recommended dose of dexamethasone therapy or have a contraindication to corticosteroid treatment.
 + Moderately ill patients: Baricitinib may be considered in patients on supplemental oxygen who are on a recommended dose of dexamethasone therapy or have a contraindication to corticosteroid treatment.
 + Mildly ill patients: Baricitinib is not recommended for mildly ill COVID-19 patients who do not require oxygen.
 Article 3: COVID-19 Hospitalizations Look Different in the Omicron Wave 
 The article discusses how hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are changing during the Omicron wave.
 Unvaccinated Ontarians make up a significant portion of ICU admissions, with an occupancy rate almost 15 times higher than that of fully vaccinated people.
 Medical professionals note that while Omicron infections may be leading to fewer severe cases of COVID-19-related pneumonia compared to earlier waves, hospitalizations are still occurring due to other factors such as frailty, chronic illness, and pandemic fatigue.
 The stress on the hospital system is being exacerbated by health workers isolating or taking sick leaves due to COVID-19.
