I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
From Article 2, we see that British Columbia (B.C.) has fewer hospitalizations and active cases compared to Ontario, suggesting that Ontario's situation may be more severe than initially thought.
Article 3 highlights B.C.'s success in flattening the curve due to their functioning public health system and early measures taken to prevent community transmission. This implies that Ontario's public health leadership culture may have contributed to its current surge.
However, Article 4 warns that smokers are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, which could lead to an increase in hospitalizations.
Article 5 reports a steep rise in COVID-19 patients projected over the next two weeks, requiring additional intensive care beds. This suggests that Ontario's hospitals may be facing significant challenges in the coming days.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by increasing it by 20% to account for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to the severity of COVID-19 cases and the strain on Ontario's healthcare system.
The adjusted forecast is: 638
