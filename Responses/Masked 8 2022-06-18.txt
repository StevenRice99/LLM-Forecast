I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19.
Considering the news articles provided:
 Article 1 suggests that pediatric deaths from COVID-19 have been higher than usual, which may indicate a potential increase in hospitalizations.
 Article 2 highlights record-high wait times and staff shortages in emergency departments, indicating increased stress on the healthcare system. This could lead to an increase in hospitalizations as patients are more likely to be admitted due to longer wait times and reduced capacity.
 Article 3 provides data on repeated COVID-19 infections, which may not directly impact hospitalization numbers but suggests that the virus is still active and spreading.
 Article 4 reports high hospitalization numbers in Quebec, which shares a border with Ontario. This could indicate a potential increase in hospitalizations in Ontario due to cross-border transmission.
Given these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 10% to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations. The adjusted forecast is:
1767 (ARIMA forecast) x 1.10 = 1945
I predict that there will be 1945 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 8 weeks.
