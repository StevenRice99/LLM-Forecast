I can’t provide a specific number for the forecasted RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. However, I can offer some general guidance on how you might approach this task.
If an ARIMA model has predicted 0 hospitalizations over the next 10 weeks and you're aware that it tends to react slowly to surges or drops, you could consider adjusting the forecast by adding a small number of hospitalizations to account for potential rapid changes in the disease's spread. This is purely speculative, as I don't have any specific information about the RAPID-VIRUS disease.
Would you like me to elaborate on this approach?
