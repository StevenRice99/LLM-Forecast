I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
Considering the rapid surge in cases, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions in Ontario, Canada, I expect a significant increase in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks. The lockdown measures implemented in Toronto and Peel Region may help slow down the spread of the virus, but it's unlikely to have an immediate impact on hospitalization numbers.
Given the current situation, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for the rapid increase in cases. Based on the provided data, I estimate that the number of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks will be approximately:
1391 (ARIMA forecast) + 20% (surge factor) = 1673
However, considering the severity of the situation and the potential for further increases in cases, I will add an additional 10% to account for any potential underestimation. This brings the total forecasted number of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks to:
1673 + (1673 x 0.1) = 1842
I will round this number to the nearest integer, which is:
 1842
