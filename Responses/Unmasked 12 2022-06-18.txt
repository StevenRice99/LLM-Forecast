I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to staff shortages and increased patient acuity, as mentioned in Article 2. I would also consider the fact that Quebec has reported a high number of hospitalizations despite having a high vaccination rate, which may indicate that other factors such as staffing issues are contributing to the surge.
Given these considerations, I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to predict an additional 300-400 hospitalizations over the next 12 weeks, on top of the original ARIMA prediction of 2651. This would bring the total predicted number of hospitalizations to around 2950-3051.
However, considering that ARIMA is known to react too slow to surges or drops, I would also consider adding a "surge factor" to account for potential rapid increases in hospitalizations due to unforeseen circumstances such as new variants or changes in public behavior. This could add an additional 100-200 hospitalizations to the total predicted number.
Therefore, my final prediction is: 3051
