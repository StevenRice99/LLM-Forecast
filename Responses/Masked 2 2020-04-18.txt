I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, and 4 mention a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in long-term care homes, as well as inadequate infection control measures.
2. Temporary workers can work at multiple facilities : Article 4 mentions that temporary workers can work at multiple facilities, which could contribute to the spread of the virus.
3. Inspections have decreased : Articles 3 and 5 mention a decrease in comprehensive inspections (RQIs) of long-term care homes, which could lead to undetected issues and outbreaks.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for potential outbreaks in long-term care homes. Based on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths mentioned in the articles, I estimate that there may be an additional 200-300 hospitalizations due to outbreaks in long-term care homes.
Adding this surge factor to the original ARIMA forecast of 930 hospitalizations, I predict:
930 + 250 = 1180 
I will round up to the nearest integer: 1181
