I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations:
1. Long-term care homes : The articles mention a high number of COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in long-term care homes, which are likely to be hotspots for RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
2. Healthcare workers : With 980 healthcare workers testing positive for COVID-19, there is a risk of further transmission within the healthcare system.
3. Infection control oversight : The decrease in comprehensive inspections and the lack of proactive measures may contribute to the spread of RAPID-VIRUS.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 20% to account for potential surges in hospitalizations due to long-term care home outbreaks and healthcare worker transmission. This adjustment is based on the assumption that the current situation is more severe than predicted by the ARIMA model.
Adjusted forecast: 2792 + (2792 \ 0.20) = 3349
