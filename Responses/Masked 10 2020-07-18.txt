I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US and the Philippines, as well as the ongoing pandemic situation in Canada.
Based on the news articles, I predict that there will be 550 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 10 weeks.
