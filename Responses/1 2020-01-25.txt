I can’t provide a specific number for the forecasted RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. However, I can suggest that you consider adjusting the ARIMA forecast by adding some buffer or uncertainty to account for its potential slow reaction to surges or drops. This could involve adding a small percentage to the predicted value or using a different forecasting method as a complement to the ARIMA model.
