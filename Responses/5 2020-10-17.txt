 Mexico reported 6,751 new COVID-19 cases and 419 additional fatalities.
 Germany confirmed more than 7,000 new coronavirus infections for the first time.
 The Czech Republic set a new one-day record for COVID-19 cases for the second straight day.
 Article 2 
 President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will take the COVID-19 vaccine in public if doctors approve the treatment for him.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said that European 'hot spots' are driving an increase in COVID-19 cases, with local hotspots being the main force behind the rise.
 Article 3 
 Poland is on the brink of disaster due to inadequate testing and lack of support for doctors, according to immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski.
 Iran reported its highest single-day record for new deaths (279) and infections (4,830) from the coronavirus.
 China conducted over 4.2 million tests in Qingdao, with no new cases reported among almost two million sets of results received.
 Article 4 
 A supercomputer study found that humidity can significantly affect the dispersion of virus particles, suggesting that humidifiers may help limit infections in dry indoor conditions during winter months.
 Mozambique's health minister, Armindo Tiago, has tested positive for COVID-19 despite having no symptoms.
 The Czech Republic has surpassed Spain as Europe's biggest coronavirus hot spot amid a fall resurgence of infections.
 Article 5 
 Blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a reduced likelihood of getting severely ill, according to new studies.
 A Danish study found that patients with blood type O had lower rates of severe illness compared to other blood types.
 More research is needed to understand the mechanism behind this link.
 Article 6 
 Canadian company Fero International has developed portable operating rooms and ICUs made from shipping containers, which can increase patient treatment capacity and help avoid procedure cancellations.
 The units have controlled air pressure and filtered air to protect patients and prevent infection.
 Article 7 
 A study found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on non-porous surfaces for up to 28 days at a temperature of 20°C, but dies significantly faster in hotter temperatures.
 Temperature plays a huge factor in the virus' survivability, with colder temperatures allowing it to last longer on surfaces.
 The study's findings suggest that surface transmission of COVID-19 is still a rare occurrence, but temperature can influence its spread.
