I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to the Omicron wave among young children and the potential impact of increased vaccination rates.
Considering the news articles, I will add a surge factor to the ARIMA forecast to reflect the expected increase in hospitalizations. Based on Article 1, which mentions that pediatric deaths from COVID-19 have been higher than what is generally seen from the flu each year, and Article 2, which highlights record-high wait times and staff shortages in emergency departments, I will add a 15% surge factor to the ARIMA forecast.
Additionally, considering Article 3, which shows that unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get COVID-19 multiple times, I will assume that vaccination rates will continue to increase, leading to a decrease in hospitalizations. However, this effect may be offset by the potential for increased transmission due to waning immunity and the emergence of new variants.
Considering Article 4, which reports high hospitalization numbers in Quebec despite high vaccination rates, I will also consider the possibility that Ontario's hospitalization numbers may not follow the same trend as Quebec's.
Taking all these factors into account, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to:
1767 (ARIMA forecast) x 1.15 (surge factor) = 2030
However, considering the potential offsetting effects of increased vaccination rates and waning immunity, I will further adjust the forecast to:
2030 - 100 (accounting for potential decrease in hospitalizations due to vaccination) = 1930
But then I will add back a small portion of that 100 to account for the fact that Quebec's high hospitalization numbers are not necessarily indicative of Ontario's trend.
1930 + 50 = 1980
