 Mexico reported 6,751 new COVID-19 cases and 419 additional fatalities, bringing the total to over 841,000 cases and more than 85,700 deaths.
 Germany confirmed more than 7,000 new coronavirus infections for the first time, its second consecutive daily record.
 The Czech Republic set a new one-day record for COVID-19 cases for the second straight day, with 9,721 new cases reported on Thursday.
 Article 2 
 Poland is on the brink of disaster due to inadequate testing and lack of support for doctors, according to immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski.
 Iran has reported its highest single-day record for new deaths (279) and infections (4,830) from the coronavirus.
 The country has imposed a travel ban on five major cities, including Tehran and Mashhad, ahead of an important religious holiday.
 Japan found that humidity can significantly affect the dispersion of virus particles, suggesting that humidifiers may help limit infections in dry indoor conditions during winter months.
 Article 3 
 Blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a reduced likelihood of getting severely ill, according to new studies.
 A Danish study found 38.4% with blood type O tested positive for COVID-19, compared to other studies that showed higher rates of severe illness in patients with blood types A or AB.
 Article 4 
 Fero International's portable operating rooms and ICUs can increase patient treatment capacity and help avoid procedure cancellations.
 The units have controlled air pressure and filtered air to protect patients and prevent infection.
 Article 5 
 COVID-19 hospitalizations are down compared to the initial wave, but a second wave could be deadly.
 A study found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on non-porous surfaces for up to 28 days at a temperature of 20°C.
 However, the virus dies significantly faster in hotter temperatures and is reduced by 50% (half-life) within 2.74 days on paper bank notes and 1.68 days on cotton.
Overall, these articles highlight the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19 around the world, including record-breaking case numbers, inadequate testing and support for healthcare systems, and the potential for a second wave of infections in Canada.
