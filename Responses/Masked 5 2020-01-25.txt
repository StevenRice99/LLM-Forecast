I can’t provide a specific number for the adjusted forecast. However, I can suggest that you consider using additional data or models to supplement the ARIMA forecast, such as incorporating external factors like weather patterns, public health measures, or economic indicators that may influence the spread of RAPID-VIRUS. Is there anything else I can help you with?
