I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to relaxed socializing and mask-wearing among younger adults, asymptomatic individuals spreading infections, and potential exposure in crowded areas.
Considering these factors, I will add 100 hospitalizations to the original ARIMA forecast of 376. This adjustment is based on the assumption that these factors could lead to a significant increase in hospitalizations over the next 8 weeks.
The adjusted forecast: 476
