These articles provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on education, events, and global vaccination efforts.
 Key Takeaways: 
1. Education: The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table recommends a permissive approach to masking in low-risk scenarios for in-person schooling. However, in moderate-to-high risk scenarios, an increase in temporary measures is warranted, including cohorting and age-dependent masking.
2. Events: The "River and Sky" festival required vaccination proof and rapid COVID-19 testing at the gate, resulting in no reported positive cases among attendees over two days. This suggests that organizers took steps to mitigate the risk of transmission.
3. Vaccination Efforts: Higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infection rates among unvaccinated individuals. However, despite these findings, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in areas with low vaccination rates.
 Recommendations: 
1. Education: In low-risk scenarios, a permissive approach to masking is recommended, while in moderate-to-high risk scenarios, temporary measures like cohorting and age-dependent masking are warranted.
2. Events: Organizers should consider implementing measures such as vaccination requirements and rapid COVID-19 testing at events to mitigate the risk of transmission.
3. Vaccination Efforts: Global vaccine distribution is crucial to reduce the toll of the pandemic, particularly in areas with high transmission rates.
 Conclusion: 
These articles highlight the importance of considering community risk levels when implementing measures for in-person schooling and events during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infection rates among unvaccinated individuals, but disparities remain, emphasizing the need for global vaccine distribution to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
