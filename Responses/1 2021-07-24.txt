These articles discuss various aspects of the 2022 academic year in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on guidelines for in-person schooling, vaccination rates, and the impact of vaccination on transmission.
 Key Takeaways: 
1. Guidelines for In-Person Schooling: The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table provides recommendations for in-person schooling based on community risk levels. These include permissive masking approaches, cohorting, and age-dependent masking.
2. Vaccination Rates: Vaccination rates are high (61% of Ontarians 12+ are fully vaccinated), which should keep severe infections and hospitalizations low.
3. Impact of Vaccination on Transmission: Higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infection rates among unvaccinated individuals. Studies have found that areas with high vaccination rates had significantly lower rates of COVID-19 infections among unvaccinated youth.
4. Transmission in Low-Vaccination Areas: Variants such as delta, alpha, and beta are spreading rapidly throughout Africa, where vaccination rates are low. Pockets of unvaccinated individuals remain, driving transmission and hospitalizations.
 Recommendations: 
1. Permanent Measures: Permanent measures such as vaccination, proper cleaning, and good hand hygiene can help prevent hospitalizations.
2. Temporary Measures: Temporary measures like contact tracing, testing, and mask-wearing may be necessary in moderate to high-risk scenarios.
3. Global Vaccine Distribution: The need to distribute vaccines globally to areas with high transmission is emphasized to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
Overall, these articles highlight the importance of vaccination rates in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and the need for continued vigilance and temporary measures to prevent hospitalizations and transmission.
