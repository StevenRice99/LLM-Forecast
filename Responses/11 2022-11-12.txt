Based on the provided articles, here are some key points relevant for forecasting hospitalizations in Ontario:
1. RSV surge : The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is surging in many parts of Canada, including Ontario, with ICUs operating at high capacity.
2. COVID-19 resurgence : Positive test results for COVID-19 are back on the rise, hitting 17% most recently, and there's a concern that Ontario will face the triple threat of respiratory illnesses (influenza, RSV, and COVID-19) in the coming months.
3. Influenza A dominance : The dominant strain of influenza A is expected to be positive for this year.
4. Pediatric hospital capacity : Pediatric hospitals are already overflowing with children sick with illnesses including RSV and COVID-19.
These points suggest that Ontario can expect a surge in respiratory-related hospitalizations, particularly among children, due to the combination of RSV, influenza A, and COVID-19.
