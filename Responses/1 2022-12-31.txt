I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to ongoing virus transmission and Christmas gatherings.
Considering the steady flow of COVID-19 hospitalizations throughout 2022 in Quebec (Article 1), I expect a similar trend in Ontario, Canada. The continued circulation of contagious variants, such as omicron, may contribute to increased hospitalizations.
The story of Salomon Lázaro highlights the struggles of migrant workers during the pandemic (Article 2). While this article does not directly relate to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, it emphasizes the importance of considering factors like vaccination status, living situation, and occupation when analyzing potential surges or drops in hospitalizations.
However, none of these articles provide information that would significantly alter the ARIMA forecast. The predicted number of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next week remains 568.
I will add a buffer to account for potential surges due to ongoing virus transmission and Christmas gatherings. Based on this analysis, I predict:
569
