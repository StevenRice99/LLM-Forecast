I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, and 4 mention a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in long-term care homes, as well as inadequate infection control measures.
2. Temporary workers can work at multiple facilities : Article 4 mentions that temporary workers can work at multiple facilities, which could lead to the spread of the virus.
3. Inspections have decreased : Articles 3 and 5 mention a decrease in comprehensive inspections (RQIs) of long-term care homes, which could contribute to inadequate infection control measures.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for potential outbreaks in long-term care homes. Based on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths mentioned in the articles, I estimate that there may be an additional 100-200 hospitalizations due to RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) in Ontario's long-term care homes.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is:
465 (ARIMA forecast) + 150 = 615
