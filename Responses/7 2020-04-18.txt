I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations:
1. Long-term care homes : The articles mention a high number of COVID-19 outbreaks and cases in long-term care homes, which are likely to be hotspots for RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
2. Healthcare workers : With 980 healthcare workers testing positive for COVID-19, there is a risk of further transmission within the healthcare system.
3. Infection control oversight : The decrease in infection control inspections and the lack of comprehensive resident quality inspections (RQIs) may contribute to the spread of RAPID-VIRUS.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 20% to account for potential surges in hospitalizations due to long-term care home outbreaks and healthcare worker transmission. This adjustment is based on the assumption that the current ARIMA model underestimates the impact of these factors.
New forecast: 3257 (ARIMA) + (3257 x 0.2) = 3894
