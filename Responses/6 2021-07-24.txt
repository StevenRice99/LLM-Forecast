These articles discuss various aspects of the 2022 academic year in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on guidelines for in-person schooling, vaccination rates, and the impact of vaccination on transmission.
 Key Points: 
1. Guidelines for In-Person Schooling: The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table provides recommendations for classroom settings, extra-curricular activities, and transportation to school based on community risk levels.
2. Vaccination Rates: Vaccination rates are high in Ontario (61% of Ontarians 12+ are fully vaccinated), which should keep severe infections and hospitalizations low.
3. Impact of Vaccination on Transmission: Higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infection rates among unvaccinated individuals, according to studies published in The Lancet and Public Health England.
4. Transmission and Hospitalizations: Despite high vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are still rising in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates.
 Recommendations: 
1. Permanent Measures: Permanent measures such as vaccination, proper cleaning, and good hand hygiene can help prevent hospitalizations.
2. Temporary Measures: Temporary measures like contact tracing, testing, and mask-wearing may be necessary in moderate to high-risk scenarios.
3. Global Vaccine Distribution: The need to distribute vaccines globally to areas with high transmission is emphasized to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
 Implications: 
1. School Reopening: Ontario students should return to class barring catastrophe, according to a report by the CBC.ca.
2. Festival Safety: A festival in Northern Ontario had a vaccination requirement and rapid COVID-19 testing at the gate, with no positive cases reported among attendees over two days.
3. Vaccine Disparities: Pockets of unvaccinated individuals remain, driving transmission and hospitalizations, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates.
Overall, these articles highlight the importance of vaccination in preventing severe infections and hospitalizations, as well as the need for temporary measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. They also emphasize the need for global vaccine distribution to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
