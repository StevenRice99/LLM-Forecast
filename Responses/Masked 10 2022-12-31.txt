I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, as mentioned in Article 1 of 3. I will also consider the vaccination status, living situation, and occupation/ workplace conditions that may contribute to increased hospitalizations, as highlighted in Article 2 of 3.
Considering these factors, I will add a surge of approximately 2000 hospitalizations over the next 10 weeks to the ARIMA forecast, bringing the total to:
5685 (ARIMA forecast) + 2000 (surge adjustment) = 7685
However, this is still an underestimation considering the potential for increased hospitalizations due to ongoing virus transmission and Christmas gatherings. I will add another 1000 hospitalizations to account for these factors.
7685 + 1000 = 8685
