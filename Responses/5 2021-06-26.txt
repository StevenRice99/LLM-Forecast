Based on the provided articles, I would say that the following information would not be captured in this data:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario (mentioned in Article 6)
 The exact strategies used by other hospitals in the GTA to manage COVID-19 cases and conserve resources (similar to Brampton Civic Hospital's efforts mentioned in Article 7, but without specific details)

These pieces of information are not explicitly stated in any of the articles provided.
