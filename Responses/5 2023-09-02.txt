Based on the articles provided, one thing that can be done to help decrease transmission of COVID-19 is:
 Reinstating mask mandates in schools 
This suggestion comes from Article 4, which highlights the effectiveness of masking in reducing the spread of COVID-19, especially when layered with other public health measures. The article also warns about a potential "tridemic" this fall due to the circulation of RSV, influenza, and new COVID-19 variants, making mask mandates an important measure to protect vulnerable individuals.
This recommendation is supported by Article 1, which mentions Dr. Etches saying "one thing we can do to help decrease transmission..." (although the specific action is not mentioned in this article).
