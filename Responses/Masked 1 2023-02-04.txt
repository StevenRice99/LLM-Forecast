I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the information from the news articles.
Considering Article 1, which reports stable or dropping COVID-19 trends in Ottawa, I will reduce the ARIMA forecast by 10% to account for a potential decrease in hospitalizations due to declining cases.
Considering Article 2, which suggests a possible indirect relationship between COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and alcohol-related health issues, I will increase the adjusted forecast by 5% to account for a potential increase in hospitalizations related to alcohol use.
Considering Article 3, which reports on the family doctor shortage in Ontario, I will increase the adjusted forecast by another 2% to account for people without a regular family physician being more likely to end up hospitalized.
The final adjusted forecast is: 336 - (10% of 336) + (5% of 336) + (2% of 336) = 336 - 33.6 + 16.8 + 6.72 = 326.08
Rounding down to the nearest whole number, I predict that there will be 326 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next week.
