I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 reinfection and the stress on emergency departments.
Based on Article 3 of 4, it appears that there is a decrease in reported cases of repeated COVID-19 infections, which may indicate a slight decline in hospitalization rates. However, this trend is not consistent across all regions (Article 4 of 4 shows Quebec's high hospitalization numbers), and the overall impact on Ontario's hospitalizations is uncertain.
Considering Article 2 of 4, the stress on emergency departments and record-high wait times may lead to an increase in reported hospitalizations due to delayed or missed diagnoses. This could result in a higher number of hospitalizations than predicted by ARIMA.
Taking these factors into account, I will adjust the forecast to:
1104 (ARIMA prediction) + 100 = 1204
This adjustment accounts for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 reinfection and the stress on emergency departments.
