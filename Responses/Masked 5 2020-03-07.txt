I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the news articles, I notice that:
 There are already confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario (20 as of Jan 28), which may indicate a higher risk of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
 The "lab-in-a-box" project could potentially increase testing capacity and accessibility, leading to earlier detection and isolation of cases. This might slow the spread of the disease.
 However, the fact that there are already confirmed cases in Ontario, combined with the global situation (1694 cases and 34 deaths in Italy), suggests that RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations may surge.
Given these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for a potential surge. I will add 20% to the original ARIMA forecast of 124 hospitalizations over the next 5 weeks.
Adjusted forecast: 149
