I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in several large US states (Article 1), I expect a similar trend to affect Ontario, Canada. The fact that Canadian government officials are expressing concerns about reopening the border due to the ongoing pandemic situation in the US also suggests a potential increase in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
However, Article 3 provides some reassurance that children are less likely to be hospitalized or receive ICU care compared to older patients, which might mitigate the impact of any surge.
Article 4 reports on a surge of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the Philippines, with private hospitals reaching full capacity for treating patients. This is concerning and suggests that Ontario, Canada may also experience a similar surge in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Finally, Article 5 reports on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in Ontario, with 130 new cases reported in the past week. The provincial total of 36,594 cases and active cases in the Kingston area are also concerning.
Taking these factors into account, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to be more conservative and anticipate a potential surge in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 11 weeks.
Adjusted Forecast: 650 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
