I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, as mentioned in Article 1 of 3. I will also consider the vaccination status, living situation, and occupation/ workplace conditions that may contribute to increased hospitalizations, as highlighted in Article 2 of 3.
Considering these factors, I will add a surge of approximately 1000 hospitalizations over the next 7 weeks to the ARIMA forecast, bringing the total to:
3979 (ARIMA forecast) + 1000 (surge adjustment) = 4979
However, this is still an underestimation considering the potential for increased hospitalizations due to ongoing virus transmission and Christmas gatherings. I will further adjust the forecast by adding another 500 hospitalizations, bringing the total to:
4979 + 500 = 5479
