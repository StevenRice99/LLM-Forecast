I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 emphasize the importance of infection control in these settings. Given their high risk, I will increase the forecasted hospitalizations by 20% to account for potential outbreaks.
2. Healthcare workers are at risk : Article 2 mentions that 980 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19, which could lead to more hospitalizations. I will add a 10% increase to the forecast to reflect this.
3. Infection control oversight is lacking : Articles 3 and 5 highlight the decrease in comprehensive inspections of long-term care homes. This lack of oversight might contribute to increased hospitalizations due to outbreaks. I will add another 15% to the forecast to account for this.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast as follows:
Original ARIMA forecast: 4653
Adjusted forecast: 4653 + (20% of 4653) + (10% of 4653) + (15% of 4653)
= 4653 + 930.6 + 465.3 + 697.95
= 5957
The adjusted forecast is: 5957
