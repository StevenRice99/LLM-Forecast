 Experts expect a steady state of COVID-19 activity in Canada with no distinct variant-driven waves.
 The population has immunity to COVID-19, and death rates are lower since the beginning of the pandemic.
 Article 7: 
 This article discusses the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada.
 Key takeaways include:
 + Science evolves: Scientific knowledge can change rapidly, and public health officials must be prepared to adapt their recommendations accordingly.
 + Trust is a two-way street: The government and public health officials must communicate clearly and transparently with the public, while also acknowledging and addressing concerns and mistrust.

 Article 8: 
 Future challenges may arise for older and immune-compromised Canadians, but the impact may not be as profound as it was in 2020 or 2021.
 The population has immunity to COVID-19, and death rates are lower since the beginning of the pandemic.
 Article 9: 
 This article discusses the challenges that may arise if another pandemic occurs:
 + Distrust and polarization: The experience of the past three years has created distrust among some segments of society, which could make it more difficult to implement public health measures in the future.
 + Lessons not learned: Some experts worry that the lessons from the pandemic will not be applied, leading to a repeat of mistakes made during COVID-19.
 The article concludes by highlighting the importance of learning from past experiences and being prepared for future public health crises.
