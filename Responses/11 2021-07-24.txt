These articles discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidelines for in-person schooling, vaccination rates, and the impact of vaccination on transmission.
 Key Points: 
1. Guidelines for In-Person Schooling: The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table provides recommendations for in-person schooling during the pandemic, considering community risk levels.
2. Vaccination Rates: Vaccination rates are high (61% of Ontarians 12+ are fully vaccinated), which should keep severe infections and hospitalizations low.
3. Transmission and Hospitalizations: Despite high vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are still rising in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates.
4. Variants and Transmission: Variants such as delta, alpha, and beta are spreading rapidly throughout Africa, where vaccination rates are low, leading to a 43% week-on-week rise in COVID-19 deaths across the continent.
5. Pockets of Unvaccinated Individuals: Pockets of unvaccinated individuals remain, driving transmission and hospitalizations.
 Recommendations: 
1. Increase Vaccination Efforts: The need to distribute vaccines globally to areas with high transmission is emphasized.
2. Temporary Measures: Temporary measures like contact tracing, testing, and mask-wearing may be necessary in moderate-to-high-risk scenarios.
3. Permanent Measures: Permanent measures such as vaccination, proper cleaning, and good hand hygiene can help prevent hospitalizations.
 Implications: 
1. Continued Transmission: The pandemic is likely to continue, with transmission driven by pockets of unvaccinated individuals.
2. Global Vaccination Efforts: Global vaccination efforts are necessary to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
3. Adaptation and Flexibility: Adaptation and flexibility in response to changing community risk levels and emerging variants will be essential for managing the pandemic.
