I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions due to RAPID-VIRUS. Based on the news articles, it appears that the situation is worsening rapidly, with a 22% increase in hospitalizations and a 50% increase in ICU visits over the past week.
Given this information, I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to predict an even higher number of hospitalizations than initially predicted by the model. Considering the recent trends and the fact that the ARIMA model tends to react slowly to surges or drops, I would add a buffer to account for the potential acceleration of the outbreak.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 523
