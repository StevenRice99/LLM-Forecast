It seems like you've provided a series of articles related to COVID-19 vaccines and hospitalizations in Canada. Here's a summary of the key points:
 Article 3: Federal advisory panel recommends end to hotel quarantine in Canada 
 Mandatory hotel quarantine may be replaced with a requirement for travellers to present a suitable quarantine plan.
 Fully vaccinated travellers may not require pre-departure tests or quarantine, but will still need to provide proof of vaccination.
 Partially vaccinated travellers will still require testing and quarantine.
 Article 4: A snapshot of Canada's progress in administering COVID-19 vaccines 
 60% of eligible Canadians have been vaccinated with their first dose.
 The rate at which second doses are being administered is lagging behind the first-dose rate (0.11% vs 1% per day).
 If this rate continues, 20% of eligible population will be fully vaccinated by early October.
 Shortening the waiting time between doses could prioritize people in high transmission situations, including those who are 12-17 years old.
 Article 5: Manitoban with COVID-19 died after attempted transport to Ontario 
 23 COVID-19 patients from Manitoba have been transferred to Ontario hospitals due to ICU capacity issues.
 Some COVID-19 patients are being sent to northern Ontario hospitals.
 Article 6: 12 ICU nurses among federal supports headed to Manitoba as COVID-19 batters hospitals 
 Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
 + Number of patients sent from Manitoba to Ontario hospitals (18)
 + Availability of hospital beds in Ontario for Manitoba patients (at least 20)
 + Capacity of Canadian Armed Forces to transport patients to out-of-province hospitals (up to 2 patients per day)
