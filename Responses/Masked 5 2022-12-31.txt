I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, as mentioned in Article 1 of 3. I will also consider the vaccination status, living situation, and occupation/ workplace conditions that may contribute to increased hospitalizations, as highlighted in Article 2 of 3.
Considering these factors, I will add a surge of approximately 500-700 hospitalizations over the next 5 weeks to the ARIMA forecast. This is based on the fact that Quebec experienced a peak of 8,700 new COVID-19 admissions in January 2022, and Ontario may experience similar surges due to ongoing virus transmission.
Therefore, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast from 2842 hospitalizations to:
2842 + 600 = 3442
However, considering the potential for increased hospitalizations due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, I will add an additional surge of approximately 200-300 hospitalizations. This brings the total forecasted hospitalizations over the next 5 weeks to:
3442 + 250 = 3692
