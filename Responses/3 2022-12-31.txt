I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, as mentioned in Article 1 of 3. I will also consider the vaccination status, living situation, and occupation/ workplace conditions that may contribute to increased hospitalizations, as highlighted in Article 2 of 3.
Considering these factors, I will add a surge of approximately 200-300 hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks to the ARIMA forecast. This is based on the potential for increased transmission due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus circulation.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 1705 + 250 = 1955
