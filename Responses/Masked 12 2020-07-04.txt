I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to relaxed socializing and mask-wearing among younger adults, asymptomatic individuals spreading infections, and exposure of older and more vulnerable people in crowded areas.
Considering these factors, I would add 100-150 hospitalizations to the original ARIMA forecast of 564. This adjustment takes into account the potential for increased transmission and hospitalization rates due to the mentioned factors.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 664
