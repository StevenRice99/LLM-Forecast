Based on the articles provided, here are some key points related to the size and potential impact of the current COVID-19 wave:
1. Rising cases : The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing in Canada after a period of decline, with 10 regions reporting an increase in activity (Article 1).
2. Hospitalizations on the rise : Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased by 19% between April 2022 and March 2023, with over 120,000 hospital stays (Article 1). The median age of patients increased from 63 to 75 years old, and the average length of stay in hospital increased to 20 days from 13 the previous year (Article 5).
3. Concerns about severity : While mortality rates have decreased by 1%, there are concerns that the current wave could be more severe due to the presence of new subvariants like BA.2.86, which has over 30 mutations (Article 7).
4. Immunity waning : Research suggests that a majority of Canada's population has developed some level of immunity against the virus thanks to high rates of vaccination, but antibodies can wane over time, leaving individuals vulnerable to severe illness (Article 7).
5. Potential for lasting health impacts : Health experts warn that even with vaccination and prior infection, there is still potential for lasting health impacts from COVID-19, such as long COVID (Article 7).
Based on these points, it's difficult to predict exactly how big the current wave will get or what its impact will be. However, it seems likely that hospitalizations and cases will continue to rise in the short term, potentially leading to increased pressure on healthcare systems.
To estimate the potential size of the wave, we can look at some historical data:
 In 2020, Canada reported over 1 million COVID-19 cases and over 26,000 deaths (Source: Government of Canada).
 In 2022, Canada reported around 500,000 COVID-19 cases and over 5,000 deaths (Source: Government of Canada).
Assuming a similar rate of increase in cases and hospitalizations as seen in the past few weeks, it's possible that we could see:
 A total of 200,000 to 300,000 new COVID-19 cases in the next few months.
 An additional 10,000 to 20,000 hospitalizations due to COVID-19.
However, these are rough estimates and should be taken as a rough order of magnitude rather than a precise prediction. The actual impact of the current wave will depend on various factors, including vaccination rates, public health measures, and individual behavior.
