Based on the articles provided, one thing that can be done to help decrease transmission of COVID-19 is:
 Reinstating mask mandates in schools 
This suggestion comes from Article 4, which highlights the effectiveness of masking in reducing the spread of COVID-19, especially when layered with other public health measures. The article also warns about a potential "tridemic" this fall due to the circulation of RSV, influenza, and new COVID-19 variants, making mask mandates an important measure to protect vulnerable individuals.
Dr. Etches' statement in Article 1, "one thing we can do to help decrease transmission...", suggests that there is a specific action that can be taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Reinstating mask mandates in schools aligns with this sentiment and provides a concrete step towards reducing transmission.
