I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to relaxed socializing and mask-wearing among younger adults, asymptomatic individuals spreading infections, and exposure of older and more vulnerable people in crowded areas.
Considering these factors, I would add 100-150 hospitalizations to the original ARIMA forecast of 470 over the next 10 weeks. This adjustment takes into account the potential for increased transmission rates due to relaxed public health measures and the importance of monitoring ICU bed availability and hospital capacity.
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 570
