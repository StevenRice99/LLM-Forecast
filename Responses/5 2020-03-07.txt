I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the news articles, I notice that:
 The "lab-in-a-box" project may lead to increased testing and detection of cases, potentially causing a surge in hospitalizations.
 The current number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario is relatively low (18), but there are reports of increasing cases globally (1694 in Italy).
 The McMaster student's negative test result suggests that the virus may not be spreading as rapidly as feared.
Given these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for a potential surge in hospitalizations. However, since the ARIMA model is known to react too slow to surges or drops, I will also consider adding some extra caution to the forecast.
I predict that there will be 150 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 5 weeks.
