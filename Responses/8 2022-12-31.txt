I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges due to Christmas gatherings and ongoing virus transmission, as mentioned in Article 1 of 3. I will also consider the vaccination status, living situation, and occupation/ workplace conditions that may contribute to increased hospitalizations, as highlighted in Article 2 of 3.
Considering these factors, I will add a surge of approximately 2000 hospitalizations over the next 8 weeks to the ARIMA forecast, bringing the total to:
4548 (ARIMA forecast) + 2000 (surge adjustment) = 6548
However, this is still an overly cautious estimate. Given that Article 1 mentions a steady flow of COVID-19 hospitalizations throughout 2022 with a peak of 8,700 new admissions in January 2022, and considering the current vaccination status and other factors mentioned in Articles 2 and 3, I will further adjust the forecast to:
6548 - 1000 (to account for lower hospitalization rates due to increased vaccination and other mitigating factors) = 5548
Therefore, my final adjusted forecast is:
5548
