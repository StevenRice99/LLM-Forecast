Here's a summary of the articles:
 Article 1: Ontario Exceeds 400 COVID Patients in ICU 
 The article reports that Ontario has exceeded 400 patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs), with 2,419 total hospitalizations and 412 ICU admissions.
 The number of ICU admissions is up 80% compared to one week ago.
 The majority of patients in the ICU are unvaccinated (123) or fully vaccinated (137).
 Article 2: Baricitinib for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 
 This article provides a scientific brief on the use of baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory medication, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
 The Ontario Science Table recommends using baricitinib in critically ill and moderately ill patients who are receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
 Important considerations include concomitant corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors, pregnancy and breastfeeding, renal function, and monitoring.
 Article 3: COVID-19 Hospitalizations Look Different in the Omicron Wave 
 The article discusses how hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are changing during the Omicron wave.
 Despite raw numbers appearing to narrow, unvaccinated people have an occupancy rate almost 15 times higher than that of fully vaccinated people in ICUs.
 Medical professionals note that while Omicron infections may be leading to fewer severe cases of COVID-19-related pneumonia, hospitalizations are still occurring due to other factors such as frailty and chronic illness.
