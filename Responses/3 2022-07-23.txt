Here are the main points from the six articles:
 Article 1: Quebec Avoids New COVID Mandates Ahead of Fall Election as Hospitals Fill Up 
 Quebec is experiencing a 7th wave of COVID-19 cases with over 1,887 people hospitalized.
 Staffing shortages due to the virus have led to scaling back summer service in six emergency rooms.
 Health officials are urging caution but say cases are under control.
 Article 2: You'll Likely Catch COVID-19 Again and Again. Will Each Round Feel Milder? 
 Repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a more robust immune response in some individuals, making subsequent infections milder.
 Vaccination is an effective way to train the immune system without facing health risks associated with direct exposure.
 Not every reinfection will be benign, and certain groups may still experience severe outcomes.
 Shifting risk factors for severe disease should be considered, such as weight gain, diabetes, or immunosuppression.
 Article 3: What a 4th COVID Shot Can Do for You — and What It Can't 
 The third dose provides significant protection against severe disease and infection with Omicron BA.1.
 Some experts suggest that a fourth dose of the original vaccine strain may be beneficial for certain groups, such as older adults or those with compromised immune systems.
 However, others argue that expanding fourth doses to younger Canadians could actually do more harm than good by discouraging people from getting their third dose.
