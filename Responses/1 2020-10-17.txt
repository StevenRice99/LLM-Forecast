Here are the key points from the articles:
 Article 1 
 The US state of California reported a record number of daily COVID-19 cases (3,861) and a seven-day average of new confirmed cases topping 3,000 for the first time.
 Mexico reported 6,751 new COVID-19 cases and 419 additional fatalities, bringing the total to over 841,000 cases and more than 85,700 deaths.
 Germany confirmed more than 7,000 new coronavirus infections for the first time, its second consecutive daily record.
 The Czech Republic set a new one-day record for COVID-19 cases for the second straight day, with 9,721 new cases reported on Thursday.
 Article 2 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said that European 'hot spots' are driving an increase in COVID-19 cases, with local hotspots being the main force behind the rise.
 President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will take the COVID-19 vaccine in public if doctors approve the treatment for him.
 Article 3 
 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has reached 141,804, with 3,217 deaths.
 Poland is on the brink of disaster due to inadequate testing and lack of support for doctors, according to immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski.
 Iran reported its highest single-day record for new deaths (279) and infections (4,830) from the coronavirus.
 Article 4 
 A supercomputer study found that humidity can significantly affect the dispersion of virus particles, suggesting that humidifiers may help limit infections in dry indoor conditions during winter months.
 China has conducted over 4.2 million tests in Qingdao, with no new cases reported among almost two million sets of results received.
 Article 5 
 Blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a reduced likelihood of getting severely ill, according to studies from Denmark and Canada.
