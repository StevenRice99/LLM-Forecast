 Poland is on the brink of disaster due to inadequate testing and lack of support for doctors, according to immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski.
 Iran has reported its highest single-day record for new deaths (279) and infections (4,830) from the coronavirus.
 The country has imposed a travel ban on five major cities, including Tehran and Mashhad, ahead of an important religious holiday.
 Japan conducted a supercomputer study that found humidity can significantly affect the dispersion of virus particles.
 Article 3 
 Blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a reduced likelihood of getting severely ill, according to new studies.
 A Danish study found 38.4% with blood type O tested positive for COVID-19, compared to other studies that showed higher rates of severe illness in patients with blood types A or AB.
 Article 4 
 Fero International's portable operating rooms and ICUs can increase patient treatment capacity and help avoid procedure cancellations.
 The units have controlled air pressure and filtered air to protect patients and prevent infection.
 Article 5 
 COVID-19 hospitalizations are down compared to the initial wave, but a second wave could be deadly.
 A study found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on non-porous surfaces for up to 28 days at a temperature of 20°C.
 Temperature plays a huge factor in the virus' survivability, with colder temperatures allowing it to last longer on surfaces.
