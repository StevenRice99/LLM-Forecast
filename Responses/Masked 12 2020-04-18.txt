I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, and 4 mention the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in long-term care homes, as well as the lack of comprehensive inspections.
2. Temporary workers can work at multiple facilities : Article 4 mentions that temporary workers can work at multiple facilities, which could contribute to the spread of the virus.
3. Decrease in infection control oversight : Articles 3 and 5 highlight a decrease in comprehensive inspections (RQIs) and infection control violations.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for potential outbreaks in long-term care homes and correctional facilities. Based on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths mentioned in the articles, I estimate that there may be an additional 10% to 20% increase in hospitalizations due to these factors.
Therefore, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 10% to 20% to the predicted value of 5584. This results in a new forecast of:
 6216 (10% increase) or 6233 (15% increase) or 6250 (20% increase) 
However, since you requested a single integer answer, I will choose the middle value of this range.
The final answer is: 6233
