Based on the provided articles, I would say that the following information would not be captured in this data:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario (mentioned in Article 6)
 The exact strategies used by other hospitals in the GTA to manage COVID-19 cases (while Brampton Civic Hospital's approach is detailed, it's unclear what other hospitals did)
 The demographics of patients experiencing mild symptoms (e.g., age range, underlying health conditions) beyond what Dr. Andrew Morris mentions
 A comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of targeted testing strategies in different settings (e.g., schools, congregate-care facilities)
These pieces of information are not explicitly mentioned or analyzed in the provided articles, so they would not be captured in this data.
