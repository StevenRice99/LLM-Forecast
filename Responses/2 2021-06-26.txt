Based on the provided articles, I would say that the following information would not be captured in this data:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario (mentioned in Article 6)
 The exact strategies used by other hospitals in the GTA to manage COVID-19 cases (while Brampton Civic Hospital's strategies are discussed in detail, there is no mention of other hospitals' approaches)
 The demographics and health status of individuals who have died from COVID-19 (there is no discussion of mortality rates or specific patient outcomes beyond hospitalization)
These pieces of information might be relevant for a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on Canada, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided articles.
