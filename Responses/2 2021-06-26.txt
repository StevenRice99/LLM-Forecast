Based on the provided articles, I would say that the following information would not be captured in this data:
 The specific number of hospitalizations in Ontario (mentioned in Article 6)
 The exact strategies used by other hospitals in the GTA to manage COVID-19 cases (while Brampton Civic Hospital's strategies are discussed in detail, there is no mention of other hospitals' approaches)
 The demographics and age distribution of those experiencing mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases (the article mentions that some people experience mild symptoms similar to a common cold, but does not provide specific data on who these individuals are)
These pieces of information might be relevant for a more comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact in Canada, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided articles.
