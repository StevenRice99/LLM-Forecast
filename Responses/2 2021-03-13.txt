I would adjust the predicted value of 917 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 2 weeks to 1050. 
The articles suggest that there may be a surge in cases due to various factors such as:
 Early warning systems being underutilized or not implemented effectively (Article 1)
 New complications arising from COVID-19, such as sudden onset diabetes (Article 2), which could lead to more severe outcomes and hospitalizations
 The effectiveness of vaccination in preventing hospitalizations among high-risk groups, such as LTC residents and HCWs, being uncertain (Article 3)
 Indigenous communities being disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 due to socio-economic marginalization and limited access to health services (Article 4)
Considering these factors, it is likely that the actual number of hospitalizations will be higher than predicted.
