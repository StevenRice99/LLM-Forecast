I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the news articles, I notice that:
 The "lab-in-a-box" project may lead to increased testing and detection of cases, potentially causing a surge in hospitalizations.
 The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario is relatively low (18), but increasing.
 The Italian outbreak suggests a potential for rapid spread.
Given these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 20% to account for potential surges or drops. This brings the adjusted forecast from 174 to:
174 + (174 x 0.2) = 209
I predict that there will be 209 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 7 weeks.
