It seems that I've been provided with a list of 9 news articles and research references related to COVID-19, influenza, and other respiratory viruses in Canada.
To summarize the key points from these articles:
1. COVID-19 surge : Ontario is experiencing a surge in infections, with rising test positivity rates.
2. Mask mandates : Dr. Steve Findall recommends hospital mask mandates to protect vulnerable patients.
3. Rapid tests : Rapid tests are less accessible due to discontinued provincial programs and varying distribution systems across local public health units.
4. Vaccination push : B.C. is launching a fall vaccine push, urging residents to get shots for COVID-19 and flu, with priority given to high-risk groups.
5. Updated Moderna vaccine : An updated Moderna COVID-19 vaccine will soon be available for Ontario residents, providing protection against the dominant omicron XBB variant.
6. Fall vaccination campaign : A fall vaccination campaign across N.L. is set to begin on Oct. 16, with a focus on high-risk groups and vaccination against both COVID-19 and influenza.
Additionally, there are references to research studies related to wastewater-based surveillance for early warnings of COVID-19 surges and RSV outbreaks, disease burden estimates of RSV-related acute respiratory infections in adults, hospital admissions for respiratory tract infections in children, and the use of international risk scoring tools for preventing severe RSV infection.
If you'd like me to help with anything specific or provide a more detailed summary of each reference, please let me know!
