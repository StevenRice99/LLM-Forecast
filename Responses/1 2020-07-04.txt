I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the potential surge in hospitalizations due to relaxed socializing and mask-wearing among younger adults, asymptomatic individuals spreading infections, and exposure of older and more vulnerable people in crowded areas.
Considering these factors, I would increase the forecasted number of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next week. However, since there is no direct data or information about Ontario's COVID-19 situation provided in the articles, I will make a conservative adjustment to the ARIMA forecast.
I would add 20% to the original ARIMA forecast of 47 hospitalizations, resulting in:
47 + (47 x 0.2) = 56
So, my adjusted forecast is: 56
