I would adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the rapid surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions reported in the news articles.
Considering the recent lockdowns, rising ICU admissions, and community spread of COVID-19, I expect a significant increase in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks. The ARIMA model's tendency to react slowly to surges or drops suggests that it may underestimate the actual number of hospitalizations.
To adjust for this, I would add an additional 20% to the ARIMA forecasted value of 1391, resulting in a revised forecast of:
1391 + (1391 x 0.2) = 1673
This adjustment takes into account the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, as well as the potential for further increases due to the lockdown measures.
Therefore, my final answer is: 1673
