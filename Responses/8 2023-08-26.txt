Based on the articles provided, here are some key points related to the size and potential impact of the current COVID-19 wave:
1. Rising cases : COVID-19 cases are increasing in Canada after a period of decline, with 10 regions reporting an increase in activity (Article 1).
2. Hospitalizations on the rise : Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased by 19% between April 2022 and March 2023, with over 120,000 hospital stays (Article 1). The median age of patients increased from 63 to 75 years old, and the average length of stay in hospital increased to 20 days from 13 the previous year (Article 5).
3. Concerns about severity : While mortality rates have decreased by 1%, there are concerns that the current wave could be more severe due to the presence of new subvariants like BA.2.86, which has over 30 mutations (Article 7).
4. Immunity waning : Health experts warn that immunity developed through vaccination and prior infection can wane over time, leaving Canadians vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19 (Article 7).
5. Booster shots expected to help : Booster shots are expected to shore up Canadians' immunity this fall, particularly against major subvariants of the virus (except possibly BA.2.86) (Article 7).
Based on these points, it is difficult to predict exactly how big the current COVID-19 wave will get. However, the increasing hospitalizations and cases suggest that the situation could become more severe if not managed properly.
To estimate the potential size of the wave, we can look at some historical data:
 In 2020, Canada experienced a peak of over 4,000 new COVID-19 cases per day (Source: Government of Canada).
 In 2022, Canada saw a smaller peak of around 1,500 new cases per day (Source: Government of Canada).
Assuming the current wave follows a similar trajectory, we could estimate that the number of new cases per day might reach around 2,000-3,000. However, this is highly speculative and depends on various factors, including vaccination rates, public health measures, and the effectiveness of booster shots.
In terms of hospitalizations, if the current trend continues, we might see an increase in hospitalizations to around 150,000-200,000 per year, based on the 19% increase mentioned earlier. However, this is also highly speculative and depends on various factors, including the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of public health measures.
In summary, while it is difficult to predict exactly how big the current COVID-19 wave will get, the increasing hospitalizations and cases suggest that the situation could become more severe if not managed properly.
