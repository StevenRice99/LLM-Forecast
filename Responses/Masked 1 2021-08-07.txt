I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent trends in Ontario, Canada.
Based on the news articles provided, I notice that:
 Article 3 suggests a decline in COVID-19 patients in ICU, which may indicate a decrease in severe cases.
 Article 4 mentions Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang's goal of achieving a 90% student vaccination rate to avoid a fourth wave, which could lead to a reduction in hospitalizations.
However, I also notice that:
 The ARIMA model has predicted an increase in hospitalizations over the next week (92), but this may be too slow to react to potential surges or drops.
 There is no clear indication of a significant surge or drop in RAPID-VIRUS cases in Ontario, Canada.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 20% to account for the recent trends and potential vaccination efforts. This brings the adjusted forecast to:
92 + (92 x 0.2) = 110
I predict that there will be 110 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next week.
