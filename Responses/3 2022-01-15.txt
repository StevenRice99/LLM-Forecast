Here's a summary of the articles:
 Article 1: Ontario Exceeds 400 COVID Patients in ICU 
 The number of COVID patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has exceeded 400 for the first time.
 There are currently 2,419 total hospitalizations and 412 ICU admissions (up 80% compared to one week ago).
 Unvaccinated patients make up a significant portion of those hospitalized and in ICUs.
 Article 2: Baricitinib for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 
 A scientific brief from the Ontario Science Table recommends the use of baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory medication, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
 The recommendations are based on a review of existing evidence and include guidelines for critically ill, moderately ill, and mildly ill patients.
 Important considerations include concomitant corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors, pregnancy and breastfeeding, renal function, and monitoring.
 Article 3: COVID-19 Hospitalizations Look Different in the Omicron Wave 
 The article discusses how hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are changing during the Omicron wave.
 Despite raw numbers appearing to narrow, unvaccinated people make up a significant portion of those hospitalized and in ICUs.
 Medical professionals note that while Omicron infections may be leading to fewer severe cases of COVID-19-related pneumonia, hospitalizations are still occurring due to other factors such as frailty, chronic illness, and pandemic fatigue.
 Key Points 
 Unvaccinated people have an occupancy rate almost 15 times higher than that of fully vaccinated people in ICUs.
 Hospitalizations are still occurring due to factors such as frailty, chronic illness, and pandemic fatigue.
 The stress on the hospital system is being exacerbated by health workers isolating or taking sick leaves due to COVID-19.
