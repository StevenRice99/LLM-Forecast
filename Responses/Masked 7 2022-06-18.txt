I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19.
Based on the news articles provided, it appears that there is a potential increase in RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations due to various factors such as:
 Pediatric deaths from COVID-19 being higher than usual
 Hospitalizations surged during the Omicron wave among young children
 Staff shortages and high rates of staff calling in sick or unable to work because they've been exposed to COVID-19
 Increased patient acuity and stress levels on staff
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding 10% to the predicted number of hospitalizations over the next 7 weeks.
Adjusted forecast: 1546 + (1546 x 0.1) = 1703.6  1704
