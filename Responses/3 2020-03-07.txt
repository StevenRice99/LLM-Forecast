I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the news articles, I notice that:
 The "lab-in-a-box" project may lead to increased testing and detection of cases, potentially causing a surge in hospitalizations.
 The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario is relatively low (18 as of 5 days ago), but increasing.
 There are no explicit mentions of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in the news articles.
Given this information, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops. Since ARIMA tends to react too slow to changes, I will add a buffer to the forecast to account for any unexpected increases in hospitalizations.
I predict that there will be 90 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 3 weeks.
