It seems like you've got a collection of articles related to COVID-19 vaccines and hospitalizations in Canada. Here's a brief summary:
 Article 3: A federal advisory panel recommends ending hotel quarantine for international travelers entering Canada, replacing it with a requirement for a suitable quarantine plan. Fully vaccinated travelers may not need pre-departure tests or quarantine, but will still need to provide proof of vaccination.
 Article 4: According to CTV News, 60% of eligible Canadians have been vaccinated with their first dose, while the rate of second doses is lagging behind (0.11% vs 1% per day). If this trend continues, only 20% of the eligible population will be fully vaccinated by early October. However, if provinces prioritize people in high transmission situations and shorten the waiting time between doses, Canada could reach:
 20% fully vaccinated by July 7
 50% by August 4
 80% by September 1
 90% by September 11
 Article 5: A Manitoban with COVID-19 died after being transported to an Ontario hospital. This article highlights the challenges faced by hospitals in Manitoba due to ICU capacity issues.
 Article 6: The Canadian government is sending 12 ICU nurses and other federal supports to Manitoba as COVID-19 cases surge. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include:
 Number of patients sent from Manitoba to Ontario hospitals (18)
 Availability of hospital beds in Ontario for Manitoba patients (at least 20)
 Capacity of Canadian Armed Forces to transport patients to out-of-province hospitals (up to 2 patients per day)
 Article 7: This article is unrelated to COVID-19 and discusses a panel discussion on cardiovascular diseases, specifically heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
