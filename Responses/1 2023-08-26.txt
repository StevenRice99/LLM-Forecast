Based on the articles provided, here are some key points related to the size and potential impact of the current COVID-19 wave:
1. Rising cases : The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing in Canada after a period of decline.
2. Hospitalizations up 11% : There was an 11% increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in Canada on August 15 compared to the previous week.
3. Median age increased : The median age of patients has increased from 63 to 75 years old, indicating that older adults are being disproportionately affected by the current wave.
4. Average length of stay increased : The average length of stay at hospitals has increased from 13 to 20 days, suggesting a more severe illness or longer recovery time for some patients.
5. Mortality rate decreased : Despite the increase in hospitalizations, the mortality rate has decreased by 1%, which may be due to improved treatment and vaccination efforts.
However, there are also indications that the current wave might not be as severe as previous ones:
6. Wastewater data suggests low risk of surge : Wastewater data from Sudbury suggests that the EG.5 variant is circulating in Canada but does not indicate a high-risk of a COVID-19 surge this fall.
7. Vaccination efforts : Research shows that a majority of Canadians have developed some level of immunity against the virus, which may reduce the severity of illness and hospitalizations.
Overall, while there are concerns about the rising number of cases and hospitalizations, the data suggests that the current wave might not be as severe as previous ones, and vaccination efforts continue to play an important role in mitigating the impact of COVID-19.
