Based on the articles provided, here are some key points related to the size and potential impact of the current COVID-19 wave:
1. Rising cases : The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing in Canada after a period of decline.
2. Hospitalizations up 11% : There was an 11% increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in Canada on August 15 compared to the previous week.
3. Average length of stay increased : The average length of stay in hospitals due to COVID-19 has increased from 13 days to 20 days, indicating a more severe illness or longer recovery time.
4. Mortality rate decreased : Despite the increase in hospitalizations, the mortality rate associated with COVID-19 has decreased by 1%.
5. Wastewater data suggests low risk of surge : Wastewater data from Sudbury indicates that the EG.5 variant is circulating in Canada but does not suggest a high-risk of a COVID-19 surge this fall.
6. Vaccination efforts ongoing : Public Health Sudbury and Districts (PHSD) plans to prioritize COVID-19 vaccinations for those at highest risk of complications or hospitalizations, while Ontario Ministry of Health updates vaccine guidance based on new scientific information.
However, there are also some concerns raised in the articles:
1. Potential for lasting health impacts : Research suggests that first or repeat infections can lead to long COVID and other lasting health impacts.
2. New subvariants pose risks : The BA.2.86 subvariant has caught attention due to its heavy mutations (over 30), which could potentially evade front-line immune defenses.
Overall, while the current wave of COVID-19 cases is increasing in Canada, the articles suggest that vaccination efforts and public health measures are ongoing to mitigate the impact of the virus.
