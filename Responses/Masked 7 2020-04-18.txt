I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the provided news articles.
The articles highlight several key issues that could impact RAPID-VIRUS (COVID-19) hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
1. Long-term care homes are vulnerable to outbreaks : Articles 2, 3, and 4 mention a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in long-term care homes, as well as inadequate infection control measures.
2. Temporary workers can spread the virus across multiple facilities : Article 4 highlights a "loophole" that allows temporary workers to work at multiple long-term care homes, increasing the risk of transmission.
3. Insufficient inspections and oversight : Articles 3 and 5 reveal a significant decrease in comprehensive resident quality inspections (RQIs) since 2017, which could contribute to inadequate infection control measures.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by adding a surge factor to account for potential outbreaks in long-term care homes. Based on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported in these facilities, I estimate that there may be an additional 10% to 20% increase in hospitalizations due to RAPID-VIRUS.
Therefore, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast by multiplying it by a factor of 1.15 (10% increase) to 1.2 (20% increase). This adjustment is conservative and takes into account the potential for outbreaks in long-term care homes.
The adjusted forecast is: 3257 x 1.18 = 3839
