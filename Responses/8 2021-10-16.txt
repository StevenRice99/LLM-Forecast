 However, it is mentioned that vaccination rates are high (89% of respondents were vaccinated) which could impact hospitalization rates (Article 7).
 Experts agree that while countries have reported waning immunity against COVID-19 infection, the vaccines still provide prolonged protection against severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death (Article 9).
It's worth noting that Article 5 mentions a new COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir, developed by Merck that can cut hospitalization or death risk by half in mild to moderate cases. However, this article does not provide specific information on hospitalizations in Ontario.
Overall, the articles suggest that vaccination rates are high and vaccines still provide strong protection against severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death, but there is a need for continued vigilance and potential future needs for boosters.
