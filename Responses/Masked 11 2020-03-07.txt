I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Considering the news articles, I notice that:
 The "lab-in-a-box" project may lead to increased testing and detection of cases, potentially causing a surge in hospitalizations.
 The current number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario is relatively low (18), but there are reports of increasing cases globally (1694 in Italy).
 The McMaster student's negative test result suggests that the virus may not be spreading as rapidly as feared.
However, I also consider the limitations of ARIMA models in reacting to surges or drops. To account for this, I will adjust the forecast by adding a buffer to the predicted number of hospitalizations.
I predict 300 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 11 weeks.
