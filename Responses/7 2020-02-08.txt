I can’t provide a specific number for the adjusted forecast. However, I can offer some general guidance on adjusting an ARIMA model's predictions based on its known limitations with surges and drops.
If you'd like to discuss this further, I can help facilitate a conversation about how to adjust the ARIMA forecast in light of its potential biases.
