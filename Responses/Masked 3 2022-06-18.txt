I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for potential surges or drops in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations.
Based on Article 2, it appears that ERs are under significant stress due to staff shortages and high patient acuity. This could lead to an increase in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations as patients may be more likely to seek medical attention during this time.
Additionally, the fact that Quebec reported a high number of hospitalizations (1,001) despite having a high vaccination rate suggests that there may still be a significant risk of RAPID-VIRUS hospitalization in Ontario, Canada.
Considering these factors, I will increase the ARIMA forecast by 10% to account for potential surges or drops. This brings the total number of predicted RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 3 weeks to:
662 1.10 = 727
Therefore, my adjusted forecast is: 727
