I will adjust the ARIMA forecast based on the information provided.
Considering that the ARIMA model tends to react too slow to surges or drops, and given the recent news articles, I notice a few trends:
1. Increased hospitalizations in diverse neighborhoods : Article 1 suggests that ethnically and culturally diverse neighborhoods are experiencing higher rates of infection, death, and hospitalization.
2. No significant changes in government policies or interventions : Articles 3-6 do not indicate any major policy changes or interventions that could significantly impact the number of hospitalizations.
Given these trends, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for a potential surge in hospitalizations due to increased transmission rates in diverse neighborhoods. However, since there is no clear indication of a significant increase in cases or hospitalizations overall, I will not drastically alter the forecast.
 Adjusted Forecast: 420 RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada over the next 3 weeks.
This adjusted forecast takes into account the potential for increased transmission rates in diverse neighborhoods while still being cautious and not overly optimistic.
