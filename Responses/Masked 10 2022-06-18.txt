I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for the recent surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19.
Based on the news articles provided, it appears that there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, particularly among young children and unvaccinated individuals. Additionally, Quebec reported 1,001 hospitalizations and 19 ICU admissions, which suggests a high level of transmission.
Considering these factors, I will adjust the ARIMA forecast to account for a potential surge in RAPID-VIRUS hospitalizations over the next 10 weeks. The adjusted forecast is:
2209 + 500 = 2709
I have added 500 hospitalizations to the original ARIMA forecast to reflect the potential surge in cases due to COVID-19. This adjustment takes into account the recent increase in hospitalizations and the high level of transmission.
The final answer is: 2709
