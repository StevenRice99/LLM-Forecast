Title: With eating disorders on the rise in Canada, experts break down common myths
Publisher: CTV News

This article addresses four common myths about eating disorders (EDs) and provides accurate information and resources to help dispel these misconceptions. Here are the key points:
Myth 1: EDs only affect people who are overweight or obese 
The health-care system often focuses on weight loss, which can lead to body image concerns for individuals with larger body sizes.
EDs can occur in anyone, regardless of their weight or appearance.
Myth 2: You have to look a certain way to have an ED 
People with EDs may not appear underweight or unhealthy, but still exhibit symptoms such as restrictive eating and excessive exercise.
Health professionals should focus on the individual's behavior and attitudes towards food and body image, rather than their physical appearance.
Myth 3: Social media is the main cause of EDs 
While social media can contribute to body dissatisfaction and trigger EDs in some individuals, it is not the sole cause.
Research suggests that genetics (heritability) plays a significant role in the development of EDs, with environmental factors such as comments from loved ones or exposure to dieting industry marketing also contributing.
Myth 4: EDs only affect women 
Men can also develop EDs, which can manifest differently than in women.
Boys and men may experience more severe physical symptoms, such as headaches, cold skin, hair loss, and fatigue, but still require treatment and support.
The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of accurate information and resources for individuals affected by EDs. It provides a list of hotlines and resources dedicated to supporting people with eating disorders, including:
National Eating Disorder Information Centre (1-866-633-4220)
Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868 or http://www.kidshelpphone.ca)
Canada Suicide Prevention Helpline (1-833-456-4566 or 1-866-277-3553 in Quebec)
These resources offer confidential and anonymous support for individuals struggling with EDs, as well as their loved ones.
