The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) data shows that 25,000 people were hospitalized or died due to self-harm in 2018-19.
Hospitalization rates were highest among girls and women aged 10-24.
Death rates from suicide were highest among men 45 years and older.
The pandemic has triggered heightened anxiety over health risks, prolonged confinement, and financial insecurity.
People living in low-income neighbourhoods had twice the rate of hospital stays for self-harm compared to those in high-income neighbourhoods.
Residents in rural or remote areas were more likely to have a hospital stay for self-harm.
These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they highlight potential increases in mental health-related hospitalizations due to the pandemic.
