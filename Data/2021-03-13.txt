Publisher: CTV News
Posted: Today
Key values:
Early warning systems can help officials assess action needed (Julianne Piper)
Timing matters when bringing in border measures to curb transmission (Piper)
Countries with tight border restrictions early on had more success controlling the virus (e.g. New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia)

Title: A new COVID-19 side effect? Some patients are developing sudden onset diabetes
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: Today
Up to 14% of COVID-19 patients may develop sudden onset diabetes.
People with diabetes are already more at risk of experiencing severe outcomes if they contract COVID-19.
The connection between COVID-19 and diabetes development is described as "a bidirectional relationship".
Researchers are investigating the possible causes, including steroid use and direct damage to insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Title: Early Impact of Ontario’s COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout on Long-Term Care Home Residents and Health Care Workers
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 5 days ago
The study aimed to estimate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 incidence, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and deaths among Ontario long-term care (LTC) home residents and healthcare workers (HCWs). The analysis used a difference-in-differences approach, comparing outcomes in LTC residents and HCWs with those in control populations. Here's a summary of the key points:
Data Sources: 
Public Health Case and Contact Management Solution database
PHU websites, news articles, Twitter posts, and personal communications for vaccination start and completion dates
Exposure: 
Time since the start of COVID-19 vaccination within LTC homes in each PHU
Partial completion of PHU vaccination was interpolated from 0% to 100%
Control Populations: 
For LTC residents: individuals 70 years or older living outside of LTC homes
For LTC HCWs: individuals aged 18-64 years who were not coded as HCWs
Outcomes: 
Daily number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in LTC residents and HCWs
Secondary outcomes: daily number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths
Estimation Methods: 
Quasi-Poisson regression with penalized spline for baseline trend and effect of vaccination
Difference-in-differences analysis to estimate prevented cases, hospitalizations, and deaths
The study's findings are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the methods described, it is likely that the analysis estimated the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths among LTC residents and HCWs, compared to control populations. The results would provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing these outcomes in high-risk groups.

Title: New Iceland: Drawing parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and smallpox
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
Key values:
Indigenous communities are disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 due to socio-economic marginalization.
Access to effective monitoring and early-warning systems, as well as adequate health and social services, is limited in these communities.
These communities have taken measures to limit exposure to the virus by keeping land borders closed.
