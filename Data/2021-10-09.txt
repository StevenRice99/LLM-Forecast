Title: Just give us the straight goods on COVID—without bureaucratic rhetoric like “discontinued isolation”
Publisher: Focus on Victoria

This article discusses the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia (BC) and compares it to the situation in Ontario and Quebec. The author suggests that BC's more cautious approach to managing the virus in schools may be contributing to the higher number of cases in the province.
The article quotes a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, who attributes the decline in cases in Ontario and Quebec to their proactive measures, such as universal mask mandates and improved ventilation systems. In contrast, BC's policy-makers focused on vaccination and deemed schools relatively safe, with a partial mask mandate only implemented later.
The author argues that this more cautious approach may have contributed to the higher number of cases in BC, particularly among children who were not considered a major vector for viral spread. The article also highlights the importance of transparency and honesty in government communication during times of crisis, citing examples of under-reporting hospitalizations and delayed responses to public health concerns.
The author concludes by emphasizing the need for clear and accurate information from government officials, rather than relying on statistics or bureaucratic jargon. He suggests that adults should be able to think for themselves and make informed decisions based on reliable data, rather than being swayed by opaque or contradictory information.
Key points:
BC has a higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to Ontario and Quebec
The author attributes this difference to BC's more cautious approach to managing the virus in schools

Title: Alberta acted like the pandemic was over. Now it's a cautionary tale for Canada
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Alberta and Saskatchewan, two provinces in Canada's Prairie region. Experts warn that both provinces are on a "really bad" trajectory, with hospitalizations and deaths rising due to unvaccinated pockets of populations.
In Alberta, the healthcare system is already stretched beyond capacity, with ICUs at risk of being overwhelmed. The province has implemented measures such as vaccine passports and incentives for vaccination, but these have had little impact on increasing vaccination rates.
Saskatchewan is also experiencing a surge in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, with experts warning that the situation may worsen before it improves. The province only recently introduced a vaccine passport system, which some experts believe came too late to make a significant difference.
In Manitoba, another Prairie province, the situation is slightly better due to higher vaccination rates, but there are still concerns about unvaccinated populations in rural areas driving transmission numbers.
Experts attribute the rise in cases and hospitalizations to a combination of factors, including vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and a lack of effective public health measures. They also express frustration with policymakers' messaging, which they feel has shifted from individual responsibility to societal blame, potentially increasing vaccine hesitancy.
The article concludes by highlighting the human cost of the pandemic, with healthcare systems already "broken" in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and experts warning that the situation may worsen before it improves.
