Here are some key points and observations based on the provided text:
Mask Mandates and Vaccine Requirements 
Several universities across Canada will remove their mask mandates and proof of vaccination requirements on May 1, but strongly recommend students continue to mask while on campus.
Some universities, such as Carleton University in Ottawa, have extended masking and vaccine requirements until at least the end of the Winter term.
In Quebec, Concordia University and McGill University will maintain mask mandates throughout the semester.
University Policies

Albertan universities have lifted mask mandates, but students are pushing back against this decision.
Students at Simon Fraser University have launched a petition to oppose the university's move to drop its mask mandate.

Online programs are expected to see enrollments rise in the coming years, particularly among students with disabilities, anxiety disorders, and socioeconomic issues.
