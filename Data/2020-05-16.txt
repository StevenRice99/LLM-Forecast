Title: Wearing gloves in public won't protect you from COVID-19, experts say
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 1 day ago
The main mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets released from the mouth or nose.
Touching a surface contaminated with COVID-19 and then touching one's eyes, nose, or mouth can also lead to infection.
Wearing disposable gloves does not provide extra protection against COVID-19 and may even increase the risk of infection if not used properly.
Regular hand washing is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends practicing good hand hygiene, not touching one's face, and practicing respiratory etiquette.

Lower-income groups have a higher rate of COVID-19 cases (113 per 100,000) and hospitalizations (20 per 100,000) compared to higher-income groups.
Newcomers to Toronto also show a higher rate of COVID-19 cases (104 per 100,000) and hospitalizations (18 per 100,000).
ICES data confirms that people living in lower-income neighborhoods are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.
These findings suggest that socioeconomic status and immigration status may be important factors to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.
