Title: What is functional neurological disorder and is it connected to COVID-19 vaccines? Experts explain
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses how videos on social media of people experiencing symptoms after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine have been misinterpreted as evidence that the vaccine is dangerous. These videos often feature individuals with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), a condition where physical symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety, rather than any underlying medical issue.
Experts warn that these unverified videos can fuel vaccine hesitancy and misinformation about vaccines. A research letter published in JAMA Neurology highlights the importance of transparently explaining FND to patients and clinicians, and not attributing symptoms solely to vaccine effects.
The article features a case study of a woman named Pardo who experienced symptoms after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, which were later diagnosed as FND. Her story illustrates how stress and anxiety can contribute to FND, and how early diagnosis and treatment can lead to recovery.
Experts emphasize that while vaccines are safe, they are not immune to causing side effects or reactions in some individuals. However, these reactions are often related to pre-existing conditions or stress, rather than any inherent flaw in the vaccine itself.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of awareness about FND and its relationship to stress and anxiety. Experts hope that increased understanding will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, reducing fear and misinformation about vaccines.
