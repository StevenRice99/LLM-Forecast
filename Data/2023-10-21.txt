Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
3,797 hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients across Canada as of Oct. 10 (note: this includes Ontario).
Patients in non-ICU beds comprise most of the latest increase in nation-wide hospitalizations.
Ratio of patients admitted to ICU versus wards is a helpful metric for assessing severity of COVID waves.
Hospitalization data can be inflated by incidental cases, where a positive COVID-19 test is not the primary reason for admission.
