Title: Coronavirus in Toronto—Lessons Lost on a Second SARS

The article discusses Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting several key differences between the country's experience and that of other countries like Taiwan. Here are some of the main points:
1. Nursing home crisis: Four out of five COVID-19-related deaths in Canada were linked to long-term care and retirement homes. The situation became so dire that provinces called in the armed forces for help.
2. Hospital capacity: Contrary to expectations, hospitals across Canada did not experience a surge in admissions, with critical care capacity exceeding the number of people admitted with COVID-19.
3. Community spread: Community spread has emerged as a far more serious problem in dealing with COVID-19 than with SARS. Testing and tracking have been inefficient due to outdated methods for tracking and data reporting.
4. Lessons from SARS: The article suggests that Canada may not have learned enough from the 2003 SARS epidemic, particularly in terms of prioritizing long-term care facilities and updating public health systems.
5. Taiwan's success: In contrast, Taiwan set up a robust, modern data system for tracing COVID-19 based on its SARS experience. The country also acted quickly with border control, mask production, and donations to other countries.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of learning from past experiences and investing in public health infrastructure to prepare for future pandemics.
