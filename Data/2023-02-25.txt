Title: Is the Rise in RSV Infections Associated With Immune Debt or SARS-CoV-2 Immune Dysfunction?
Publisher: Infection Control Today
Posted: 2 days ago
Post-COVID-19 immune deficiency may explain the surge in RSV cases.
Children who had a prior documented COVID-19 infection are almost twice as likely to develop an RSV infection.
Post-COVID-19 immunodeficiency can persist for up to 8 months and is characterized by highly activated innate immune cells and a lack of naive T and B cells.
Reinfections can occur in children, possibly at a greater frequency than in adults, and carry a significant risk of long COVID, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and immunosuppression.

Relevant.
Summary: The article discusses COVID-19 protocols in the film and television industry in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include:
60% of shows currently filming in Ontario have some form of vaccine requirement (Alistair Hepburn)
Regional considerations like surging COVID-19 related hospitalizations can trigger pivot points for production rules
The federal government's Short-Term Compensation Fund expires at the end of March, which may impact production schedules and COVID-19 protocols.

Title: Estimating COVID-19 vaccine uptake and its drivers among migrants, homeless and precariously housed people in France
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 5 days ago
The text appears to be a research study on vaccine uptake among people experiencing homelessness (PEH) in France, using a mixed-methods approach. Here's a summary of the key points:
Findings: 
1. A significant proportion of PEH participants reported being afraid of vaccines (52%).
2. Association between positive views on vaccination and COVID-19 vaccine uptake was observed.
3. Vaccinated participants held various beliefs and behaviors, with 64% convinced that the vaccine is useful and protects against COVID-19.
4. Non-vaccinated participants without any intention to receive the vaccine in the future were also noted (similar to findings in the general population of Somaliland).
5. Peer pressure was identified as a factor influencing vaccination intentions, consistent with previous studies on migrants and PEH.
6. Awareness-raising and sensitization by trusted third parties (e.g., homeless organizations, social workers) had a positive impact on vaccine uptake.
7. Support mechanisms and follow-up by medical professionals or social organizations also contributed to increased vaccine uptake.
8. Structural barriers to vaccine uptake were identified, including distance/time to vaccination centers, lack of information, and problems making online appointments.
Limitations: 
1. High replacement rate due to absence or refusal, which may have led to an underestimation of vaccine uptake in the Accommodated stratum and an overestimation in the Precariously Housed stratum.
2. Language barriers may have contributed to increased refusals.
3. The survey took place at the beginning of winter, which may have influenced the results for the Streets stratum.
4. Cross-sectional study limitations apply, including potential biases related to social desirability and survival or healthy worker bias.
Strengths: 
1. Rigorous methodology, including face-to-face surveys conducted in eight languages commonly used by PEH.
2. Sampling process ensured representativeness of all PEH/PH categories and housing types with stratification based on the ETHOS typology and random selection of sites and individuals.
