The article discusses how COVID-19 symptoms have evolved over time and how they overlap with other respiratory illnesses. Experts recommend that Canadians who are feeling under the weather should try to stay home if possible to mitigate the potential spread of viruses while they recover.
Some key points from the article include:
The sudden loss of taste or smell in the absence of any congestion is still a distinctive symptom of COVID-19, although it's less frequent than before.
Upper respiratory symptoms have become more common with new variants, while lower respiratory ones have decreased.
COVID-19 is still more dangerous than influenza, which can be a serious illness in its own right.
Rapid tests may not always detect COVID-19 immediately, and people should test again if symptoms persist.
Antiviral medication like Paxlovid is available to help limit the severity of COVID-19 when taken early on in the course of an infection.
Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of being aware of the evolving nature of COVID-19 symptoms and taking steps to protect oneself and others from the virus.
