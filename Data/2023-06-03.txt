Publisher: CTV News

Relevant.
Summary: The article reports on an increase in antipsychotic medication use in long-term care homes across Canada, including Ontario, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include:
No significant increase in behavioral symptoms of residents
10% risk-adjusted odds of potentially inappropriate antipsychotic drug use in Ontario (2019/2020: 18.3%, 2020/2021: 19.3%)
Increase in antipsychotic medication use without a diagnosis, with the highest increase in Alberta and lowest in Ontario

The study discusses the effectiveness of different countries' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, using data from Canada and several comparator peer countries (Australia, France, UK, and US). The authors analyze the impact of these responses on health outcomes, including deaths, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
Key findings:
1. Canada's response was effective: Compared to the US and UK, Canada's strong pandemic response resulted in a significant reduction in COVID-19-related deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions.
2. France had modest gains: While France's response was not as effective as Canada's, it still outperformed the US and UK in terms of health outcomes.
3. Australia's elimination strategy would have yielded further benefits: If Australia had pursued a disease control stance focused on elimination rather than mitigation, it could have achieved even better health and economic outcomes.
The study uses several metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of each country's response:
1. Oxford Pandemic Stringency Index (PSI): This index measures the stringency of pandemic control measures in each country.
2. QALYs lost: The authors estimate the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to COVID-19, which represents a lower bound for all countries.
The study's limitations include:
1. Use of Ontario-specific data: The analysis relies on case fatality rates and hospitalization risks from Ontario, which may not be representative of the entire country.
2. Assumptions about attribution of COVID-19 deaths: The authors assume that attribution of COVID-19 deaths in Canada and comparator peer countries occurred in a comparable manner.
The study concludes that Canada's strong pandemic response was effective in reducing health outcomes compared to other countries, and that Australia's elimination strategy could have yielded further benefits.

Title: National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) statement: Seasonal influenza vaccine for 2023-2024
Publisher: Canada.ca

Based on the provided text, here are some key points related to pregnant individuals and influenza vaccination:
1. Recommendation: NACI recommends offering any age-appropriate IIV (inactivated influenza vaccine) or RIV (recombinant influenza vaccine), but not LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine), to pregnant individuals.
2. Safety concern: Due to a lack of safety data, LAIV should not be administered to pregnant individuals because of the theoretical risk to the fetus from administering a live virus vaccine.
3. Breastfeeding individuals: LAIV can be administered to breastfeeding individuals.
4. Pregnancy stage: NACI recommends that all individuals who are pregnant, at any stage of pregnancy, receive IIV or RIV.
5. Risk of influenza-related complications: Pregnant individuals have an increased risk of influenza-related morbidity and mortality.
6. Protection for newborns: Vaccination of pregnant individuals protects their newborns from influenza and influenza-related hospitalization.
7. Safety of IIV during pregnancy: Active studies have not shown evidence of harm to the pregnant individual or fetus associated with influenza vaccination.
These points highlight the importance of offering influenza vaccination to pregnant individuals, particularly due to their increased risk of complications and the potential benefits for newborns.
