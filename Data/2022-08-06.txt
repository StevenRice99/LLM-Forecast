It appears that you've provided a table summary from Appendix D of a report, which discusses the changes in crime rates across various provinces and territories in Canada between 2020 and 2021. The table provides information on the percent change in Crime Severity Index (CSI) and the specific violations driving these changes.
Here's a breakdown of the key points:
The CSI decreased by 3% nationally, driven by decreases in breaking and entering and theft of $5,000 or under (non-motor vehicle).
Some provinces and territories experienced significant increases in crime rates:
+ Newfoundland and Labrador saw a 4% increase, driven by shoplifting, mischief, and child pornography.
+ New Brunswick had a 6% increase, driven by breaking and entering, theft of $5,000 or under (non-motor vehicle), and fraud.
+ Quebec experienced a 1% increase, driven by fraud and theft of motor vehicles.
+ Nunavut saw an 11% increase, driven by mischief, theft of $5,000 or under (non-motor vehicle), breaking and entering, trafficking of cocaine and methamphetamine, and fraud.
Other provinces and territories experienced decreases in crime rates:
+ Ontario had a 0% change, with increases in motor vehicle theft and child pornography offsetting decreases in breaking and entering.
+ Manitoba saw a 2% decrease, driven by a decline in shoplifting.
+ Saskatchewan experienced a 3% increase, but this was partially offset by decreases in fraud and breaking and entering.
The table also provides information on specific census metropolitan areas (CMAs) within each province or territory. For example:
St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador saw a 6% increase in crime rates, driven by homicide, shoplifting, and robbery.
Halifax, Nova Scotia experienced a 6% increase, driven by shoplifting and other unspecified factors.
Overall, the table provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in crime rates across Canada between 2020 and 2021.

Article 5 of 7
Title: Is Paxlovid underutilized in Canada?
Publisher: rabble.ca
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the availability of Paxlovid, an antiviral medication used to treat COVID-19, particularly for individuals over 60 years old who are considered high-risk for severe illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) both consider people in their sixties as being at high risk of severe illness with COVID-19.
The article highlights several reasons why Paxlovid may be restricted or not widely recommended, including:
1. Cost: A course of treatment costs about $530 American, which could be a factor in suppressing recommendations for it.
2. Scarcity: Although the shortage of Paxlovid is no longer an issue, its production is still being managed to ensure availability.
3. Regulatory controls: The Canadian government has procured 1.5 million treatment courses but has only allocated about a third of them to provinces and territories.
The article also discusses the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing severe illness from COVID-19, particularly for individuals over 60 years old. While three doses of mRNA vaccine offer robust protection against severe disease, protection fades and is less effective in people over 60 years of age, even with four doses. The new Omicron variant (BA.4 and BA.5) may further reduce the effectiveness of current mRNA vaccines.
The article concludes that making Paxlovid at-home treatment available to COVID-sick people 60 years old, regardless of their vaccination status, could help them avoid hospitalization and alleviate pressure on hospitals struggling with the burden of COVID-19 patients.
Key points:
People over 60 are considered high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Paxlovid is an antiviral medication used to treat COVID-19 in this age group.
Cost, scarcity, and regulatory controls may be restricting its availability.
mRNA vaccines offer robust protection against severe disease but fade and become less effective with age.
The new Omicron variant (BA.4 and BA.5) may further reduce the effectiveness of current mRNA vaccines.
Making Paxlovid at-home treatment available to COVID-sick people 60 years old could help them avoid hospitalization and alleviate pressure on hospitals.
