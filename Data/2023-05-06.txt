Key points:

Hospitalizations are still high in Canada, with 2,881 hospital beds occupied by COVID patients across the country (as of latest federal data).
Population immunity has increased from vaccination and infection, but there is still a significant part of the population vulnerable to infection and hospitalization, particularly among those over 60.
