Title: After 3 years of COVID-19, here’s how Canada’s ‘endemic’ future may look - National
Publisher: Global News
Posted: Today
COVID-19 hospitalizations have been relatively stable over the past 6-8 months despite the ongoing spread of Omicron subvariants.
Experts expect a steady state of COVID-19 activity in Canada with no distinct variant-driven waves.
The population has immunity to COVID-19, and death rates are lower since the beginning of the pandemic.
Future challenges may arise for older and immune-compromised Canadians, but the impact may not be as profound as it was in 2020 or 2021.

Title: Three years later: What has COVID-19 taught us and are we ready for the next big threat?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: Today
This article discusses the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada, and how they can be applied to future public health crises. The author interviews various experts, including Dr. Tim Caulfield, a professor of bioethics at the University of Alberta, and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's former chief medical officer of health.
The article highlights several key takeaways from the pandemic:
1. Science evolves: The pandemic showed that scientific knowledge can change rapidly, and public health officials must be prepared to adapt their recommendations accordingly.
2. Trust is a two-way street: The government and public health officials must communicate clearly and transparently with the public, while also acknowledging and addressing concerns and mistrust.
3. Socio-economic divisions were amplified: The pandemic highlighted existing socio-economic divisions in society, with more advantaged people being more willing to trust Canadian institutions.
4. Vaccine uptake was high: Despite some resistance, a significant majority of Albertans (78%) received their initial COVID-19 shots.
The article also discusses the challenges that may arise if another pandemic occurs:
1. Distrust and polarization: The experience of the past three years has created distrust among some segments of society, which could make it more difficult to implement public health measures in the future.
2. Lessons not learned: Some experts worry that the lessons from the pandemic will not be applied, leading to a repeat of mistakes made during COVID-19.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of learning from past experiences and being prepared for future public health crises:
1. Hope for change: Despite the challenges, there is hope for positive change, as people have learned how to negotiate with each other and extend their relationships.
2. Preparedness is key: The next time a pandemic occurs, it's essential to be better prepared, with clear communication, trust-building, and proactive measures in place.
Overall, the article provides a nuanced and thought-provoking analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, highlighting both the successes and challenges that arose during this period.

Title: How effective are monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses against Omicron-associated severe outcomes among adults?
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Posted: 1 day ago
Booster doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines were effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 among adults above 50.
Vaccine effectiveness was between 91% and 98% after the third dose, but waned to between 76% and 87% after 240 days or more.
A fourth booster dose restored vaccine effectiveness levels for two months following the fourth dose.
The rate of waning immunity beyond four months remains unclear.
Vaccine-induced immunity was seen to wane faster against infections with the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants.

Title: COVID-19 'steady' in Canada and hospitalizations have stabilized, Tam says
Publisher: CP24
Posted: 1 day ago
Relevant.
Population immunity in Canada is high due to high vaccine uptake and natural infection.
Hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths have stabilized.
Omicron subvariants continue to spread but are not causing new waves of infection.
Older or immunocompromised individuals remain disproportionately affected.

Title: COVID numbers remain stable in Ottawa
Publisher: CBC.ca

Key values:
Number of patients with COVID-19 in local hospitals (18)
COVID risk level in Ottawa (moderate to very high)
COVID test positivity rate in Ottawa (11-12%)
Number of active COVID outbreaks in Ottawa (21)
Number of COVID hospitalizations outside Ottawa (25)

Title: Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses against Omicron severe outcomes
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
Booster doses of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection (85-87%) against severe outcomes among adults aged 50-69 years even 8 months after vaccination.
Fourth doses restore waning protection and provide strong protection (86-89%) 4 months after vaccination for all age groups.
Protection wanes over time, with VE declining faster during the BA.4/BA.5-predominant period compared to the BA.1/BA.2-predominant period.
Immune evasion by BA.4/BA.5 sublineages is likely a major contributor to differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE) between the two periods.
VE against hospitalizations was lower during the BA.4/BA.5-predominant period compared to the BA.1/BA.2-predominant period, especially with increasing time since vaccination.

Title: Don't let public health fall victim to boom and bust cycles: Ontario's top doctor
Publisher: CP24
Posted: 4 days ago
Key values:
Hospitalization data is not automatically reported and requires manual processes
Delayed or missing test results due to hand-completed requisitions
Prioritizing strengthening testing, surveillance, and data systems
Needing electronic data from laboratory testing to feed into case and contact management system for all major pathogens
Importance of health equity in identifying and addressing disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
