Title: COVID-19 hasn't gone anywhere in Canada — and we could still see another surge
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: Today
Here's a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Current daily case counts are levelling off nationally, but still high (15,000 to 20,000 estimated infections).
Wastewater surveillance shows increasing concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario and other provinces.
BA.2 subvariant is expected to become the dominant strain in Canada, spreading 30% more easily than BA.1.
Hospital occupancy is expected to rise, but not to crushing levels seen earlier in the pandemic.
Communities with lower vaccination rates, crowded housing, or multi-generational homes are at higher risk of household transmission and dire outcomes.

Title: Globe editorial: We can’t make COVID disappear. But we can make the pandemic history
Publisher: The Globe and Mail

The article mentions that Ontario's science table has issued its latest modelling, which suggests hospitalizations could climb but remain far below the peak of the Omicron wave.
The forecast also notes that spring and summer will help keep infections and transmission down.
However, it is expected that the novel coronavirus may return with a sequel in the fall or sooner, including new variants with new twists.
The article highlights the importance of vaccination in preventing hospitalizations, particularly among vulnerable populations such as older Canadians.
It also notes that there are gaps in vaccination rates, with 2.4 million adults unvaccinated and many others who have not received boosters.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Vaccination rate (9 out of 10 adults have at least two shots)
Age-specific vaccination rates (e.g., 97% of Canadians 80 years and older have two shots)
Booster campaign needs (e.g., nearly a million Canadians in their 60s never got a booster)

The article reports on the efficacy and safety of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Key findings relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include:
Efficacy against symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19: 92.7%
Efficacy against COVID-19-associated hospitalization: 95.9% (based on a Phase III clinical trial)
Vaccine effectiveness estimates from observational studies:
+ Prevention of COVID-19-associated hospitalization: moderate certainty
+ Prevention of COVID-19-associated death: moderate certainty
These findings suggest that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing severe outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths, which can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: New Brunswick lifts all COVID-19 restrictions for 2nd time, hopes for different outcome
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 restrictions in New Brunswick, Canada. While mandatory restrictions have been lifted, certain groups are still advised to take additional preventive measures due to their increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
These groups include:
People 50 or older
Those who are immunocompromised
Individuals with chronic conditions
Those who are not fully vaccinated and boosted, if eligible
To minimize the risk of transmission, these individuals are advised to avoid crowded indoor spaces, limit close contact with anyone showing cold-like symptoms, continue to use masks, distance themselves from others, and practice frequent handwashing.
The article also notes that hospitals in New Brunswick remain at a red alert level, which means masks are still required and general visitors are prohibited. Long-term care facilities will continue to follow Public Health guidance, including masking and isolating those who are ill.
It's worth noting that the province lifted all restrictions last summer, on July 30, but reinstated them in September due to a surge in cases and hospitalizations. The decision to lift restrictions was made despite warnings from health officials about the potential spread of the Delta variant.
The article quotes Dr. Gordon Dow, an infectious disease expert with Horizon Health Network, who acknowledged that lifting all COVID-19 restrictions at the end of July was a mistake due to the underestimated potential spread of the Delta variant.
Overall, while mandatory restrictions have been lifted in New Brunswick, certain groups are still advised to take additional precautions to minimize their risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
