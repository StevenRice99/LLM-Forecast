This article appears to be a narrative piece that follows the daily lives and challenges faced by healthcare professionals at the University Health Network (UHN) and Sinai Health System in Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The article highlights the experiences of several key individuals:
1. Tony Mazzulli: A microbiologist-in-chief who oversees the lab operations at UHN and Sinai Health System. He discusses the challenges of managing a backlog of COVID-19 tests, which was alleviated by the provincial government's decision to tighten testing criteria.
2. Christine Bruce: The administrative director of the department where Dr. Mazzulli works. She explains how the lab had proposed an expansion plan to increase its testing capacity but faced delays in receiving funding and approval from the provincial government.
3. Fayez Quereshy: A surgical oncologist who serves as clinical vice-president at UHN. He participates in a virtual meeting of the Clinical Activity Recovery Team, which is tasked with guiding the resumption of scheduled surgeries at UHN. The team discusses an ethical framework for deciding which surgeries to cancel if the pandemic worsens.
4. Dr. Hota: An infection prevention and control specialist who manages long-term care outbreaks. She reflects on the challenges of managing outbreaks and the need for broader public health measures, such as restrictions and closures.
Throughout the article, the author weaves together these individual stories with updates on the pandemic's progression in Ontario, including:
The announcement by Premier Doug Ford that indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters will be shut down for at least 28 days due to rising COVID-19 cases.
The declaration of an outbreak at Toronto Western Hospital's eighth-floor COVID unit.
The decline in COVID-19 patients at Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals.
The article provides a nuanced and humanizing portrayal of the challenges faced by healthcare professionals during the pandemic, highlighting the complexities and uncertainties of managing a public health crisis.

The article discusses various developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world.
Remdesivir Study 
A World Health Organization (WHO) study found that Remdesivir, a drug used to treat COVID-19, had little effect on mortality rates or hospital stays among patients with the disease. The study, known as the "Solidarity" trial, concluded that Remdesivir appeared to have no significant impact on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays.
COVID-19 Cases in the US 
In the United States, COVID-19 cases are surging in Wisconsin ahead of a planned campaign rally by President Donald Trump. The state's department of health services reported grim records with daily cases reaching 3,861 and the seven-day average of new confirmed cases topping 3,000 for the first time.
Global Developments 
Mexico reported 6,751 new COVID-19 cases and 419 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to over 841,000 cases and more than 85,700 deaths.
Germany confirmed more than 7,000 new coronavirus infections for the first time, its second consecutive daily record.
The Czech Republic set a new one-day record for COVID-19 cases for the second straight day, with 9,721 new cases reported on Thursday.
Australia's largest city, Sydney, lifted quarantine restrictions on travellers from New Zealand, while Melbourne marked the 100th day of one of the world's longest pandemic lockdowns.
Other Developments 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will take the COVID-19 vaccine in public if doctors approve the treatment for him.

Global Updates 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has reached 141,804, with 3,217 deaths.
Poland is on the brink of disaster due to inadequate testing and lack of support for doctors, according to immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski.
Iran 
Iran has reported its highest single-day record for new deaths (279) and infections (4,830) from the coronavirus.
The country has imposed a travel ban on five major cities, including Tehran and Mashhad, ahead of an important religious holiday.
Iran's total cases have reached 513,000, with over 29,300 deaths and 414,800 recoveries.
Japan 
A supercomputer study found that humidity can significantly affect the dispersion of virus particles, suggesting that humidifiers may help limit infections in dry indoor conditions during winter months.
China 
China has conducted over 4.2 million tests in Qingdao, with no new cases reported among almost two million sets of results received.
The country has reported a total of 27 new cases of coronavirus, including 13 local transmissions and 14 imported cases.
Other Countries 
Mozambique's health minister, Armindo Tiago, has tested positive for COVID-19 despite having no symptoms.

Title: Blood type O may mean lower risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness, new studies suggest
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 3 days ago
Relevant.
Blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a reduced likelihood of getting severely ill.
A Danish study found 38.4% with blood type O tested positive for COVID-19, compared to other studies that showed higher rates of severe illness in patients with blood types A or AB.
The Canadian study found patients with blood type A or AB had longer ICU stays and required mechanical ventilation more often than those with blood group O or B.
More research is needed to understand the mechanism behind this link.

Title: Coronavirus can remain infectious on bank notes, other surfaces for weeks: study
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 6 days ago
The study found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on non-porous surfaces for up to 28 days at a temperature of 20°C.
However, the virus dies significantly faster in hotter temperatures and is reduced by 50% (half-life) within 2.74 days on paper bank notes and 1.68 days on cotton.
Temperature plays a huge factor in the virus' survivability, with colder temperatures allowing it to last longer on surfaces.
The study's findings suggest that surface transmission of COVID-19 is still a rare occurrence, but temperature can influence its spread.
Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: temperature (especially during winter months), humidity, and viral load.
