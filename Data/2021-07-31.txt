It appears that you've provided a collection of news articles from 2021 related to COVID-19 in New Brunswick, Canada. Here are some key points extracted from these articles:
Delta Variant 
The delta variant has been confirmed at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton.
An outbreak was declared due to six cases of the delta variant at Magee House, an apartment-style residence for mature students.
The lockdown extended to St. Thomas University and the New Brunswick Community College due to potential exposure.
AstraZeneca Vaccine 
A person who received the AstraZeneca vaccine in mid-April developed symptoms seven days later and died two days after being hospitalized.
This was the province's first death linked to the Astra-Zeneca-Oxford vaccine.
Health Minister Dorothy Shephard emphasized that the risks of dying from COVID-19 are "far greater than the risks associated with receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine."
Doctor Charged 
Dr. Jean-Robert Ngola was charged with violating the provincial Emergency Measures Act for failing to quarantine when he returned from Quebec.
The Crown dropped the charge 11 days before his trial was set to begin, citing a lack of reasonable prospect of conviction.
Protests and Border Blockade 
A group of protesters blocked the Trans-Canada Highway at the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border in June 2021, demonstrating against restrictions on travel between the two provinces.
At least two protesters were arrested during the blockade.
Vaccination Milestone 
The COVID-19 vaccination campaign reached a milestone in July 2021, with 50.4% of eligible New Brunswickers fully vaccinated (i.e., having received two doses).
Lifting Restrictions 
Premier Blaine Higgs announced that all remaining COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted on July 30, 2021, regardless of whether the province met vaccination targets.
This included lifting mask mandates and gathering limits.

Hospitalization rates:
+ Unvaccinated people: 2-3 per 100,000 weekly
+ Fully vaccinated people: 0.1 per 100,000 weekly
Mortality rates:
+ Unvaccinated people: 0.179 per 100,000 weekly

Title: Vaccines Remain Largely Effective Against Delta Variant, Counter to Claims From Fox News Guest

The provided sources are a mix of news articles, research studies, social media posts, and official government reports related to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts in 2021.
Some key points that can be inferred from these sources include:
There were concerns about the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. A study published in The New York Times suggested that the J&J vaccine may be less effective against Delta, but another study found high titers of neutralizing antibody to the Delta variant and durable antibody and T cell response for at least 8 months (Source: Topol).
There was a discussion about the need for COVID-19 booster shots. A comprehensive review of data on booster shots was shared on Twitter by Céline Gounder, and a study published in medRxiv found that Delta variants caused significantly increased vaccine breakthrough cases in Houston, Texas (Sources: Gounder, Musser et al.).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough case investigation and reporting, and the World Health Organization (WHO) provided guidance on COVID-19 vaccines (Sources: CDC, WHO).
There were concerns about the accuracy of reporting on vaccination rates and hospitalization data. A Twitter post by Lucy D'Agostino McGowan suggested that the CDC should report the percentage of unvaccinated vs. vaccinated individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 to show the effectiveness of vaccines (Source: McGowan).
Some specific claims made in these sources include:
The J&J vaccine may be less effective against Delta, but high titers of neutralizing antibody were found (Source: Mandavilli).
Booster shots may be necessary due to waning immunity over time (Sources: Gounder, Musser et al.).
COVID-19 vaccines are still highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, even with the emergence of variants like Delta (Sources: Thompson et al., Kumar et al.).
Overall, these sources provide a snapshot of the ongoing discussion and research related to COVID-19 vaccination efforts in 2021.

Title: Delta variant as contagious as chickenpox, CDC says
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: 1 day ago
Delta variant is highly contagious and can be passed on by vaccinated people.
Vaccinated individuals may have breakthrough infections with delta variant and transmit the virus to others.
In areas where vaccination rates are low, cases and hospitalizations are surging.
The article mentions that 6,587 people in the US experienced breakthrough COVID-19 infections after being fully vaccinated and were hospitalized or died.
This information can be used to inform forecasting models about the potential impact of the delta variant on hospitalization rates in Ontario, Canada.
