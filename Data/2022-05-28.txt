Title: Learning models for forecasting hospital resource utilization for COVID-19 patients in Canada
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
The study developed a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model to forecast COVID-19-related targets in 7 regions of Canada, including Ontario.
The model used past data to make forecasts for various targets, such as hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, cases, and deaths.
The results showed that the TCN model was more accurate than other models in forecasting these targets.
The study found that using a history of 3 weeks (L=21) produced the best results for 3- and 4-week forecasts.
The article highlights the importance of long-horizon forecasts for healthcare providers to mobilize necessary resources in advance.

Title: Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: a systematic review and meta-analysis - BMC Medicine
Publisher: BMC Medicine
Posted: 5 days ago
This text appears to be a summary of a research study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against two variants of the virus: B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron).
Here are the main points from the text:
Effectiveness against Delta variant 
33 studies were included in this analysis, including 3 RCTs, 13 cohort studies, and 17 case-control studies.
The summary vaccine effectiveness (VE) of full vaccination against the Delta variant was 77.8% (95% CI, 72.7–82.0).
VE against any infection and symptomatic infection with the Delta variant were 74.6% (95% CI, 70.0–78.5) and 79.2% (95% CI, 71.9–84.6), respectively.
Subgroup analysis showed that VE was higher in adolescents (88.8%, 95% CI, 83.5–92.4) and lower in older adults (59.7%, 95% CI, 45.0–70.4).
The summary VE of booster vaccination against the Delta variant was 95.5% (95% CI, 94.2–96.5).
Effectiveness against Omicron variant 
Only 3 case-control studies were included in this analysis.
The summary VE of full vaccination against the Omicron variant was 55.9% (95% CI, 40.9–67.0).
The VE of booster vaccination against the Omicron variant was 80.8% (95% CI, 58.6–91.1).
Overall, the study found that COVID-19 vaccines were effective against both the Delta and Omicron variants, although the effectiveness varied depending on the population and vaccine type.
