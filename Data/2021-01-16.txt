He emphasizes the need for clear communication and public health interventions like testing, contact tracing, and quarantine.
The article also highlights concerns about the potential impact on certain sectors, such as manufacturing and construction, which have been linked to outbreaks in recent weeks. Some experts worry that stricter measures may lead to more resistance from the public.
