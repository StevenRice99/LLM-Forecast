Title: Why it's now more likely you'll face coronavirus — even if you're vaccinated against COVID-19
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 3 days ago
Key points:
The delta variant is driving a fourth wave of cases in Canada.
Cases among fully vaccinated individuals are expected and typically milder.
However, breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals may still prompt alarm.
Serious breakthrough cases remain rare, but more likely to have dire outcomes for vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly, immunocompromised).
Ontario figures show a larger portion of overall cases among those fully vaccinated, although these are typically older and more vulnerable individuals.
Public health measures such as masking, distancing, and ventilation can help reduce the number of people being infected and buy time for more people to be vaccinated.
