Ontario's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, has expressed concerns about the initial batch of Pfizer vaccines arriving in the province, stating that it's not possible to distribute every vaccine on day one. He emphasized that this is a "trial run" until more shipments arrive.
Infectious disease specialist Isaac Bogoch also weighed in, describing the first batch as a small initial batch and emphasizing that these vaccination programs will take time to scale up. He noted that Canada has secured 20 million Pfizer doses, with four million expected by the end of March, which is enough to fully vaccinate two million people.
Bogoch highlighted that those being vaccinated this week won't achieve the promised more than 90% immunity until the second week of January and emphasized the importance of tracking who has been vaccinated and ensuring they return for their second shot. He also noted that the federal government will be keeping track of immunization rates.
The article also mentioned that Canada has signed deals with seven vaccine manufacturers, securing over 400 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. However, officials are warning that "V-Day" excitement doesn't mean the pandemic is over and Canadians should continue to follow public health guidelines.
Additionally, the article discussed the Moderna vaccine candidate, which has less complicated storage requirements than Pfizer's. While it's not yet approved by Health Canada, provinces are preparing to have access to this vaccine option later this month. The government is in talks with Moderna about receiving initial doses early.
Overall, while this week marks a promising milestone during the pandemic, Canadians are still far from "normal," and officials are emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance and adherence to public health guidelines.
