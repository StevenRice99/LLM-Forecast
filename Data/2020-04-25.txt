Quinn Carter, a 47-year-old resident at Moir Family Centre for Complex Continuing Care, was hospitalized twice due to low blood oxygen levels after his mother's visitor exemption was denied.

The family believes that if Joy had been allowed to continue caring for Quinn, these hospitalizations could have been prevented.
This case highlights the importance of considering individual patient needs and circumstances when implementing visitor policies during the pandemic.

Title: Amputations, organ failure, blood clotting: The range of complications in COVID-19 cases
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 3 days ago
Relevant article for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Key values:
High levels of inflammation in the lungs can lead to complications such as arrhythmia and unstable blood pressure.
Patients with severe cases may need ventilators, dialysis machines, and ECMO machines, which can pose risks through infection, blood clots, and other issues.
Certain medications, such as inotropes or vasopressors, are used to support the heart and control blood pressure, but can also have negative effects on certain body parts.
Patients with underlying health conditions and chronic diseases (e.g. heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes) are more at risk of having severe COVID-19 symptoms and complications.
The volume of patients requiring hospitalization is expected to be higher due to the global spread of the virus and lack of immunity in the population.
Shortages of ventilators, dialysis machines, and certain medications are a concern.

Article 7 of 8
Title: Hospital Payments and the COVID-19 Death Count
Publisher: FactCheck.org
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death counts in the United States, as well as the distribution of funds to hospitals from the $100 billion Provider Relief Fund established by the CARES Act.
Key points:
The CDC's national count now makes note of how many cases and deaths were deemed "probable" due to under-counting.
Experts believe that there could be both instances of under-counting and over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
A Kaiser Health News analysis found that the initial $30 billion allocation from the Provider Relief Fund was distributed based on prior Medicare business, rather than the severity of the pandemic in each state.
This resulted in hospitals in states less affected by the pandemic receiving more funding per case, while hospitals in heavily affected areas received less.
The article also mentions:
The possibility of false negative results from COVID-19 tests and the need to consider this when interpreting test results.
The importance of accurate diagnosis and reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The potential for increased dollars in terms of recovery funds due to over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The article cites several sources, including:
Robert Berenson, Institute Fellow at the Urban Institute
Lydia DePillis and Caroline Chen, ProPublica
Mary Divine, St. Paul Pioneer Press
Scott Jensen, State senator from Minnesota
Gerald Kominski, Senior fellow at UCLA Center for Health Policy Research
Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation
Karyn Schwartz, Senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation
The article is written in a neutral and informative style, with no apparent bias or agenda. It provides a clear explanation of the issues surrounding COVID-19 case and death counts, as well as the distribution of funds to hospitals from the Provider Relief Fund.

Title: Early signs suggest race matters when it comes to COVID-19. So why isn't Canada collecting race-based data?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 7 days ago
The article highlights the importance of collecting race-based data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities.
In Ontario, the chief medical officer of health (Dr. David Williams) states that the elderly, people with underlying conditions, and those with compromised immune systems are priorities, but does not mention racial or ethnic disparities.
Health-care advocates and professionals criticize this approach for not acknowledging existing health disparities and not allowing targeted interventions in vulnerable communities.
The article mentions that Alberta's chief public health officer has committed to exploring race-based data collection.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Collecting race-based data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities
Identifying and prioritizing groups with underlying conditions, compromised immune systems, and other risk factors
Targeted interventions in vulnerable communities based on available data
