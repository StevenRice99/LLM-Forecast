The article highlights concerns from public health experts about the potential for another COVID-19 wave in the US this winter. The experts point out that:
1. Subvariants are emerging: New subvariants of Omicron, such as BQ.1.1, are gaining ground and may eventually become dominant.
2. Immunity is waning: As immunity from previous infections or vaccinations fades, the virus has more opportunities to spread.
3. Behavioral changes are contributing: Changes in behavior, such as reduced mask-wearing and social distancing, are also contributing to the potential for a new wave.
4. Testing and sequencing have decreased: The majority of testing and sequencing has stopped globally, making it difficult to track the virus's evolution.
5. Vaccination rates are low: Only 7.6 million Americans have received their fall booster, leaving many people unprotected against severe disease, transmission, cases, and long COVID-19.
The article also highlights the importance of getting a fall booster, wearing N95 masks, and taking other precautions to protect oneself and others.
Some key takeaways from the article include:
Get vaccinated: Getting a fall booster is crucial in protecting against severe disease, transmission, cases, and long COVID-19.
