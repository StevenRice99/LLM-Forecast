Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Current hospitalization numbers: 834 people in hospital with COVID-19

Title: Why aren't there more COVID-19 surface transmissions? The answer is mucus, study suggests
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 2 days ago
The article suggests that mucus may play a significant role in preventing COVID-19 transmission through surfaces. The study found that the presence of mucin in simulated cough or sneeze droplets significantly reduced the ability of the virus to infect cells, even after the droplets had dried on a surface. This could imply that mucus acts as a barrier to prevent the virus from penetrating and causing infection.

Title: On the single and multiple associations of COVID-19 post-acute sequelae: 6-month prospective cohort study
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
The provided text appears to be a scientific article discussing the outcomes of COVID-19 patients, specifically focusing on pulmonary complications and their association with various factors such as demographic characteristics, lung examination findings, pre-existing diseases, and hospitalization status.
Here are some key points extracted from the text:
1. Pulmonary Complications (PCS) Features: The PCS features associated with a higher risk of hospitalization include male sex, non-health workers, age < 59 years, fatigue, loss of taste/smell, headache, hair loss, venous thrombosis, depression, impairment of FEV1, KCO, and 6MWT.
2. Chest CT Scan Findings: The evolution of chest CT scans in patients post-COVID-19 shows a reduction in lesions over time, with some residual reticular lesions persisting after 6 months.
3. Association between PCS Features and Chest CT Scan Findings: A bivariate analysis found that male sex, age 59 years, ex-smokers, abnormal radiography, impaired FEV1/FVC ratio, and hospitalized status were positively associated with abnormal chest CT outcomes. After multivariate adjustment, the significant predictors of an abnormal CT outcome included male sex, age 59 years, former smoker, non-smoker, abnormal radiograph, DLCO < 80%, and FEV1/FVC < 70%.
4. Predictors of Hospitalization: The PCS features associated with a higher risk of hospitalization include male sex, non-health workers, age < 59 years, fatigue, loss of taste/smell, headache, hair loss, venous thrombosis, depression, impairment of FEV1, KCO, and 6MWT.
The article suggests that certain demographic characteristics, lung examination findings, pre-existing diseases, and hospitalization status are associated with pulmonary complications post-COVID-19. The findings have implications for the management and follow-up of COVID-19 patients to prevent or mitigate long-term pulmonary consequences.
