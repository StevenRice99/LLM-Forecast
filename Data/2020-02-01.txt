What is it? 
The new virus is a type of coronavirus, which is a large family of viruses that can cause mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses, including the common cold.
Symptoms 
The symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death.
Who is most vulnerable? 
Those with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable to severe disease, which includes:
The elderly
People with chronic illness, such as diabetes, cancer, heart or lung disease
Transmission 
The virus can spread between people, but it's not clear how easily. It's recommended to take normal precautions such as washing hands and coughing into an elbow.
Global situation 
There have been 76 reported deaths attributed to the virus, all in China. Cases have also been confirmed in other countries, including France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam, Australia, and Malaysia.
Canadian situation 
A presumptive case has been reported in Canada, but it's not clear if it's a confirmed case yet. The risk to Ontarians is still low, according to Dr. David Williams, chief medical officer of health for Ontario.
Precautions 
Health officials are advising people to take normal precautions such as washing hands and coughing into an elbow. Those traveling to China are advised to avoid crowded areas and seek medical attention if they become sick.
Canada's preparedness 
Experts say Canada is much better prepared for the new coronavirus than it was for SARS in 2003. The province of Ontario has testing that can determine within 24 hours whether an illness is this new coronavirus type.
