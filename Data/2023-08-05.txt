Title: An interrupted time series analysis of trends in opioid-related emergency department visits from pre-COVID-19 pandemic to pandemic, from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program 
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the trend of opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting Program (CHIRPP) data. The study aimed to explore how the change in opioid-related ED visits during the pandemic compared to the existing pre-pandemic trend.
Key findings: 
1. Fentanyl-related visits: There was a clear increasing trend in fentanyl-related visits before the pandemic, which continued during the pandemic but did not become steeper.
2. Heroin-related visits: Heroin-related visits showed a decreasing trend starting before the pandemic among males, but not among females.
3. Age-specific analysis: Adolescents and young adults (12- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 24-year-olds) were particularly impacted at the beginning of the pandemic, possibly reflecting the heavy toll of lockdowns on this population.
4. Severity of cases: The percentage of severe cases among opioid-related ED visits did not show a significant increase during the pandemic.
Strengths: 
1. Granular analysis: The study's sex- and age-specific analyses provided valuable insights into tailored prevention and intervention efforts.
2. Use of CHIRPP data: The Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting Program (CHIRPP) data allowed for a detailed examination of opioid-related ED visits.
Limitations: 
1. Generalizability: The study's findings may not be generalizable to rural or Indigenous populations, which are under-represented in CHIRPP.
2. Age distribution: Adults were under-represented in the study, affecting the age distribution.
3. Small sample size: The small sample size limited the ability to analyze specific opioids and age/sex groups.
4. Uncertainty about opioid type: Some cases could not be discerned for opioid type, which may have impacted the analysis.
Implications: 
1. Prevention and intervention efforts: The study's findings highlight the importance of sex- and age-specific considerations when implementing prevention and intervention measures.
2. Emergency preparedness: The special considerations among adolescents and young adults in emergency preparedness and management are emphasized.
3. Future research: Further work is needed to investigate the circumstances surrounding opioid-related ED visits, which would provide useful information for prevention.

RSV hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Key values:
RSV can cause severe illness and death, especially among older Canadians.
Older adults are more likely to become severely ill and need hospitalization due to RSV.
The vaccine has an 82% efficacy in preventing lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.
Experts estimate that the number of RSV-related hospitalizations and deaths may be similar to or worse than those seen with influenza.

Title: Is the U.S. headed for another ‘tripledemic’ this fall? As COVID cases and hospitalizations rise, experts warn it could happen again
Publisher: Fortune
Posted: 1 day ago
Key values:
Wastewater levels of COVID are rising in the U.S., indicating potential increase in cases.
Hospitalizations are trending upward in the U.S., with a 12% rise in the past week.
A new variant of interest, EG.5 (also known as "Eris"), is increasing quickly in frequency and may contribute to higher case numbers.
Updated COVID vaccines are expected this fall, which should offer renewed protection against hospitalization or death from the virus.
New RSV vaccines are available for those age 60 and older, and infants, which can help reduce hospitalizations.

Title: What are the COVID-19 vaccination rates in immigrant and refugee children and adolescents in Ontario, Canada?
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
The study found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower among immigrant minors (53.1% in children and 79.2% in adolescents) compared to nonimmigrants.
Heterogeneity in vaccine uptake persisted across generations, with marked variations within immigrant groups based on region of origin.
Immigrant and refugee minors from certain regions (e.g., East Europe and Central Africa) had lower odds of vaccination, while those from Southeast Asia had higher odds.
