The article discusses the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on long-term care homes and seniors' residences in Canada. Here are the main points:
1. High fatality rates: Many long-term care homes and seniors' residences experienced high fatality rates, with some reporting over 30% of residents dying from COVID-19.
2. Lack of infection control measures: Facilities that did not identify and isolate infected residents and staff early on were more likely to experience severe outbreaks.
3. Difficulty in transferring residents to hospital: Families reported challenges in getting their loved ones transferred to the hospital, particularly when it came to end-of-life care.
4. Variations across provinces: The hardest-hit areas were Quebec and Ontario, with some facilities experiencing fatality rates as high as 40-50%.
5. No clear link between funding model and outcomes: For-profit, non-profit, and public long-term care homes experienced similar fatality rates.
6. Limited data on racial disparities: Unlike in the US, there is no equivalent data in Canada to determine whether COVID-19 disproportionately affected Black or Hispanic residents in long-term care facilities.
Some quotes from the article:
"When the infection takes hold in their lungs in this elderly population, we can just keep them comfortable. Realistically, a ventilator is not an option." - Dr. Stephen Oldridge
"Where a transfer is determined by physicians not to be clinically indicated at end of life, we are equipped to provide compassionate end-of-life care in the home." - Mary Carr, Pinecrest's administrator
The article highlights the challenges faced by long-term care homes and seniors' residences during the pandemic, as well as the importance of proper infection control measures and timely transfers to hospital.
