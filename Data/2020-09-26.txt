In Toronto, Black patients made up 21% of COVID-19 cases despite being only 9% of the population.
Researchers suspect that socioeconomic factors such as:

+ Crowded, multigenerational homes
+ Pre-existing medical conditions (e.g. obesity, diabetes)
may contribute to higher hospitalization rates in Black communities.
The study aims to recruit 2,000 Black Canadians and 1,000 non-Black Canadians to investigate these risk factors and herd immunity.
