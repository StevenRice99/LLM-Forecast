This text appears to be a research study protocol or methods section from a psychological intervention study. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Study Design 
The study is an online, transdiagnostic intervention (RESTORE) aimed at reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
Participants receive 5 brief check-ins with their guide via direct messaging or calls after completing modules 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
Guides 
Three study guides have a bachelor's degree and a background in psychology.
Guides were trained through two 2-hour workshops on the guidance manual and spent ~4 hours reviewing the online platform and practicing guidance calls.
Measures 
The primary outcomes are self-reported anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms over the past week using:
+ Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)
+ Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
+ Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5)
Suicide risk is assessed through a two-item screener.
Feasibility and acceptability are measured using:
+ Percentage of screened individuals who were deemed eligible
+ Adherence to the intervention (mean number of completed modules, drop-out rates)
+ Intervention engagement (mean number of RESTORE log-ins, text entries into the platform)
+ Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8)
Statistical Analyses 
Multilevel growth models are used to analyze outcomes on the intent-to-intervene and intervention completer samples.
Changes in primary outcomes are tested using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with a Kenward-Roger correction for small samples.
Overall, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of an online transdiagnostic intervention (RESTORE) for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Article 5 of 6
Title: Study finds long-term exposure to common air pollutants is associated with COVID-19 severity
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Posted: 5 days ago
The study analyzed data from 151,105 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario, Canada in 2020.
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and ground-level ozone (O 3) air pollutants was associated with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death.
The odds ratios for PM 2.5, NO 2, and O 3 were 1.06, 1.09, and 1.18, respectively, indicating a positive association between air pollution levels and COVID-19 severity.
The study suggests that chronic air pollution exposure before SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to COVID-19 severity.
