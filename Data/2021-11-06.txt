Title: Testing delays in northern B.C. likely contributing to spread of COVID-19, epidemiologist warns
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: Today
Key values highlighted:
Average test turnaround time in Northern Health region (B.C.) was 20-40 hours, with a peak of 74 hours due to reagent shortages and shipping delays.
This delay likely contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the region.
Rapid test kits are being used in some settings in B.C., but not widely enough to address staffing issues in small businesses.
In Ontario, rapid test kits are available for staff and students in schools, but not widely deployed in other settings.

Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
8,400 people were admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 diagnosis in the first 14 months of the pandemic.
A recent publication suggests as many as 78,000 people in Ontario may have had or currently live with "long COVID".
Factors influencing disease progression and severity include age, general health, pre-existing medical conditions, ventilation, sedative drugs, and other interventions in the intensive care unit.

Title: Vaccinated people in hospital a sign of Quebec’s ‘community failure,’ not vaccine failure: expert
Publisher: CTV News Montreal
Posted: 1 day ago
Key values:
Vaccination rate: 75% of Quebec's population has received two doses (similar to Ontario)
Breakthrough infections occur due to vaccine not being 100% effective
Immunocompromised individuals are more likely to be hospitalized despite vaccination
Two-dose vaccine reduces risk of hospitalization by 95%
Unvaccinated people are 18 times more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated people in Quebec (similar comparison can be made for Ontario)

Publisher: CBC.ca

Pregnant women in Canada are at higher risk for severe illness if they get COVID-19 and should be vaccinated as soon as possible.
Key values:
Vaccination rate among pregnant people in Ontario: ~60%
Risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and pre-term birth among unvaccinated pregnant women
Immune system suppression during pregnancy increases vulnerability to infections like COVID-19

Title: Experts weigh in on possible factors behind vaccine hesitancy
Publisher: CBC.ca

Relevant.
Summary: The article discusses COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada. Key points include:
All authorized COVID-19 vaccines in Canada are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.
Many people who are vaccine-hesitant do not hold extreme conspiracy theory-fuelled views.
Non-judgmental conversations with a friend or family member who is vaccine-hesitant can be helpful in encouraging them to get vaccinated.
Shaming or driving people underground is not an effective way to change someone's mind about being vaccinated.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: None. This article does not provide information relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Hospitalizations and emergency department visits trends among elderly individuals in proximity to death: a retrospective population-based study
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
The study found that:
1. The number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits (EDVs) per individual increases sharply as death approaches.
2. This increase is more pronounced among younger decedents, cancer patients, and those with respiratory diseases.
3. The proportion of individuals aged  95 years who had accessed the emergency department was lower than other age groups.
4. There were no significant sex differences in healthcare utilization trends.
5. The total number of EDVs per individual underwent a sharp increase as death approached.
The study's strengths include:
1. High time resolution over a 2-year period, allowing for precise identification of trend changes.
2. Population-based study with complete data on hospitalizations and EDVs.
3. Use of change-point analysis to compare trends between specific groups.
Limitations include:
1. Lack of cost analyses and quantitative/qualitative data on hospitalizations and EDVs.
2. Absence of data on hospice, palliative care services, long-term care, and primary care services.
3. Possible bias from the lack of adjustment for healthcare services not considered in the analysis.
The study suggests that:
1. Potentiating primary care support among categories more likely to use acute healthcare services may reduce hospital-based service utilization.
2. Targeting specific healthcare facilities for patients with respiratory diseases may be advisable, given their high proportion of EDVs and hospitalizations in the last month of life.
3. Future studies should examine trend differences related to specific causes of death and consider healthcare cost variations using change-point analysis.
Overall, the study provides insights into healthcare utilization trends at the end of life and highlights potential targets for interventions to improve care and reduce costs.

Title: COVID-19: Antidepressant reduces risk of hospitalization and death
Publisher: Medical News Today
Posted: 4 days ago
Edward Mills, a health researcher at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, comments on the potential of fluvoxamine as an inexpensive and effective therapy against COVID-19.
The study found that patients receiving fluvoxamine had a 32% reduced risk of hospitalization compared to those receiving a placebo.
The researchers believe that fluvoxamine's anti-inflammatory action is the most likely mechanism explaining its efficacy in COVID-19.
The article highlights the importance of early treatment with fluvoxamine before hospitalization, as it may prevent the immune system from going into overdrive.

It also highlights the importance of flu shots in reducing flu-related hospitalizations and lessening the burden on the healthcare system.
According to Health Canada, getting a flu shot is still the most effective way to protect oneself against the flu.
The article mentions that Walmart pharmacies have administered over 180,000 flu shots in 2020, an increase of over 50% from 2019.
