Title: Patently False: The Disinformation Over Coronavirus Patents
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article debunks conspiracy theories circulating online that claim patents on "coronaviruses" prove the COVID-19 virus was made in a laboratory. The author provides several examples of such conspiracy theories and explains why they are misleading or false. First, the word "coronavirus" covers an entire subfamily of viruses, including those that cause the common cold and SARS, as well as coronaviruses that affect animals such as birds and pigs. The patents cited in these theories often relate to different coronaviruses than the one that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. For instance, the Pirbright Institute's patent is for a coronavirus that causes avian bronchitis, while the University of North Carolina's patent is for a coronavirus that causes gastroenteritis in pigs. Similarly, a French conspiracy theory misrepresents a patent held by the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Université Paris VII as being for the COVID-19 coronavirus, when it is actually for the SARS-CoV virus, which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. The article also addresses the claim that a Microsoft patent describes a system of incorporating microchips in vaccines for tracking individuals. This claim is also false, as the patent is actually for a method of mining cryptocurrency using human body activity. In conclusion, the author emphasizes the importance of fact-checking and verification, as these conspiracy theories are based on misleading interpretations of official documents. There is still no evidence that the COVID-19 coronavirus was created in a laboratory, and it is important to rely on verified information from credible sources to make informed decisions and forecasts about the pandemic.

Researchers from Western University and Lawson Health Research Institute have published two significant studies on COVID-19 in Critical Care Explorations. The first study identified six molecules that can predict the severity of a patient's illness. These molecules were found to be elevated in COVID-19 patients who went on to become more severely ill, and can be used to forecast which patients are likely to survive standard ICU treatment. This has important implications for medical decision-making and resource allocation. The second study revealed a new mechanism causing blood clots in COVID-19 patients. The researchers found that damage and inflammation to the inner linings of small blood vessels create an environment conducive to platelet sticking and clot formation. This provides insight into potential alternative treatments for blood clots, such as platelet inhibitors and therapies to protect and restore the inner lining of blood vessels. Overall, these studies offer valuable tools for predicting patient prognosis and treating COVID-19 complications, which could ultimately improve patient outcomes. The identification of specific molecules and mechanisms also opens up avenues for further research and targeted interventions.

Title: First Nations back-to-school COVID-19 funding falls far short, says AFN regional chief
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the Canadian government's announcement of $112 million in funding for COVID-19 back-to-school preparations for First Nations communities, which has been deemed insufficient by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) regional chief for education, Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations Chief Bobby Cameron. Cameron estimates that the over 630 First Nations across Canada require closer to $1 billion to fully prepare for the restart of classes during the pandemic. He expresses concern that the lack of adequate funding will impact the ability of schools to safely reopen and states that First Nations leaders had requested around $9 billion in funding to address all pandemic-related impacts. Health experts have highlighted the vulnerability of Indigenous communities to COVID-19 outbreaks due to various socio-economic factors, and many First Nations have implemented strict lockdown and quarantine measures. While the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases on-reserve has been relatively low, with 438 cases, 411 recoveries, and six deaths as of August 25, 2020, the data has been criticized for excluding off-reserve Indigenous cases. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said that the federal government has provided over $2 billion in support to Indigenous communities during the pandemic and that the $112 million for First Nations back-to-school funding will provide flexibility for schools to retrofit and ensure a safe opening. He also noted that the department has been working with on-reserve schools over the summer to prepare for reopening and that additional funding was provided for resources like laptops during the previous school year. Miller stated that the department will remain flexible and ready to fill any gaps in support, including for students who need to leave their home communities to complete their high school education. Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, the acting regional AFN chief for Ontario, welcomed the funding but criticized the delay in its arrival, stating that it has caused distress among leadership in the region. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in First Nations communities, it will be important to monitor the impact of schools reopening and the effectiveness of the implemented safety measures, as well as continue to address the underlying socio-economic factors that contribute to health disparities.

Title: Which Doctoral Degree Programs Were Associated with the Highest Pay Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Focus on Very Detailed Fields of Study
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The article examines the earnings of doctoral graduates in various fields five years after graduation, adjusted for age, institution, and graduation year. The study includes 29 disciplines for men and 22 for women, with the top-earning graduates coming from diverse fields like business, health, engineering, social sciences, and education. The lowest-paid graduates are mostly in the sciences, particularly biology-related fields. Earnings vary within broad program areas for bachelor's and master's degree graduates but remain consistent for doctoral graduates, possibly due to the smaller number of disciplines at the doctoral level. Only two disciplines are female-dominated, but women perform well in both. The results may not reflect future labor market conditions as sectoral demand shifts and the COVID-19 pandemic creates new realities.
