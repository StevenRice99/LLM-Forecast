This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: The number of daily reported COVID-19 cases has decreased, with 1,446 cases on Monday and 1,039 cases on Tuesday, which is the lowest number of daily reported infections since March 6.

Hospitalizations have continued to decline, with 1,025 people being treated for COVID-19 as of Tuesday, including 662 in the ICU and 498 on a ventilator. The positivity rate has remained at 6.4% on both Monday and Tuesday.

Title: U.S. study finds tiny number of vaccine 'breakthrough' COVID-19 cases
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article is somewhat relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here's a brief summary highlighting the most important values: Breakthrough cases (infections after full vaccination) are rare, occurring in about 0.01% of fully vaccinated individuals. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 among breakthrough cases are even rarer, occurring in about 0.0007% of fully vaccinated individuals. Deaths due to COVID-19 among breakthrough cases are extremely rare, occurring in about 0.0001% of fully vaccinated individuals. Variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7, are responsible for a significant proportion (64%) of breakthrough cases. The study suggests that the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented among vaccinated individuals will far exceed the number of vaccine breakthrough cases. While this article provides valuable insights into the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and the risk of breakthrough cases, its relevance to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada is limited by the fact that it is based on data from the United States and may not reflect the specific epidemiological context of Ontario. Additionally, the article does not provide direct data on hospitalization rates or trends in Ontario.

Title: Announcement on Ontario schools 'imminent', medical officers of health chair says
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: The article mentions a potential increase of up to 11% in COVID-19 case counts if schools reopen, which could impact hospitalizations. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table suggests that this increase "may be manageable". The article also mentions that some experts, such as COVID-19 biostatistician Ryan Imgrund, believe that there is a "grey area" where schools can reopen in some form, potentially with lower case counts. The article highlights the regional differences in case counts, with the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) having higher case counts than other parts of the province, which could impact hospitalizations. These points suggest that the reopening of schools in Ontario could have an impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations, and that the province's case counts and regional differences should be taken into account when forecasting hospitalizations.
