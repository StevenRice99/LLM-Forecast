Publisher: Brighter World
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Researchers at McMaster University have developed an inhaled COVID-19 vaccine that induces robust mucosal immunity against strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the Omicron variant. This vaccine is unique as it is inhaled and targets the lungs and upper airways, providing long-lasting protection against respiratory infections. The vaccine has shown promising results in pre-clinical trials, and the team has received $8 million in funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) to proceed with Phase 2 human trials. This new vaccine strategy could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic, offering a pain-free, convenient alternative to traditional injections and addressing the issue of declining booster uptake. The researchers believe that their approach, which targets parts of the virus resistant to mutation and induces strong immunity at the infection site, could help Canada stay ahead of the virus and prepare for future pandemics. The vaccine is entirely Canadian, from design to testing, and the team is confident in its potential to significantly impact human health and quality of life.

Title: Hybrid immunity provides better protection from COVID-19 than prior infection or vaccination alone: Study
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article highlights a new international study that found people with a combination of COVID-19 vaccination and previous infection (hybrid immunity) have the strongest and most long-lasting protection against future infections compared to those who only have one or the other. The study, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that hybrid immunity provided a substantial level of protection against reinfection and an even higher level of protection against hospitalization or severe disease for at least nine months. Importantly, the protection against severe disease resulting in hospitalization lasted for at least 12 months. The study has implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it suggests that hybrid immunity offers robust and long-lasting protection against severe disease. This information can be used to inform planning and policies for future booster campaigns and to encourage individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to still get vaccinated to maximize their protection. The research also highlights the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 infections, emphasizing that deliberately getting infected is not worth the risk of severe health consequences. The study's findings may also provide insights into managing other infectious disease outbreaks.

Title: An analysis of Canadian business support programs in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the government's response through business support programs. The pandemic caused significant disruptions to people's health, the economy, and the financial system, with the Canadian GDP contracting by 10.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The Canadian government implemented various business support measures, with the two largest programs being the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Canadian Emergency Business Account (CEBA). The CEWS and CEBA accounted for roughly half of the business support funds provided in the second quarter of 2020, with wage subsidies serving as the primary vehicle of support. Overall, wage and rent support programs totaled approximately $114 billion from March 2020 to June 2022, representing 71% of total funds provided to businesses, while loans accounted for 29%. CEWS was the dominant contributor to wage subsidies, representing 96% of the total, and helped businesses retain their workforce during the economic downturn. By 2022, the employment situation in Canada had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and the demand for business support programs decreased. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts from the article can be considered: The CEWS program was effective in retaining workers and likely helped to lower the unemployment rate during the pandemic. The CEWS program was most critical during the first year of the pandemic (2020) when economic activity was severely impacted, and businesses faced challenges. The general economic situation improved in 2021 with rising vaccination rates and the reopening of businesses, leading to a decrease in the need for business support. The CEWS program's formula and qualification criteria evolved over time, which likely contributed to the decrease in wage subsidies from 2020 to 2021. These facts suggest that the demand for business support programs and the resulting economic impact are influenced by factors such as vaccination rates, business operations, and unemployment rates. Therefore, similar factors could be considered when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. For example, higher vaccination rates and booster uptake may lead to a decrease in hospitalizations, while the emergence of new variants and changes in public health measures could impact hospitalization rates. Additionally, the availability and effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19 may also play a role in forecasting hospitalizations.

Title: Are some people immune to COVID-19?
Publisher: AAMC
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the potential role of genetics in COVID-19 hospitalizations and protection against the virus. Bevin Strickland, an intensive care nurse, worked with critically ill COVID-19 patients in New York City in 2020 and, despite her close contact with the virus, did not contract it. Strickland is now participating in a study to determine if genetic anomalies protected her from infection. Scientists are exploring the possibility that some individuals may have genetic-based protections against COVID-19, similar to how a rare mutation can prevent HIV infection. Research has shown that genetic variations can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases like COVID-19, but genetic-based protection against infection is rare. However, some genetic variations have been found to block certain strains of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are studying the impact of genes on the infection and disease development cycle of SARS-CoV-2, including conditions like "COVID toes," where exposed individuals develop rashes on their toes. The COVID Human Genetic Effort (COVID HGE) is an international consortium investigating genetic factors for immunity to infection and the absence of symptoms. They are examining the role of receptors and the impact of genes on the entire infection cycle. Studies suggest that genetic variations can indicate who is more likely to develop severe cases of COVID-19 and long COVID, helping doctors apply appropriate treatments early on. While genetic immunity to COVID-19 may exist, it is unclear how this knowledge can be used for population-level protection. Researchers believe that genetic findings will likely be used to develop treatments for infected individuals, similar to what happened with AIDS. The understanding of genetic variations can also help predict who is more likely to develop severe cases, enabling better patient care and treatment strategies.

Title: B.C. surpasses 5,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 as hospitalizations continue to dip
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
COVID-19 hospitalizations and patients in critical care decreased in British Columbia (BC), Canada, according to the latest data from the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). There were 268 people hospitalized and 17 in critical care as of Thursday, down from 303 and 25 respectively the week before. Despite this decline, the province surpassed 5,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 since the pandemic began. The BCCDC also reported a 15% decrease in new confirmed cases compared to the previous week. However, the center notes that actual case numbers may be higher as the reported cases are based on lab-confirmed PCR tests, which are not widely accessible. Wastewater testing and hospitalizations provide a more accurate picture of the disease's impact. The BCCDC says that hospitalizations and wastewater data show early signs of a potential decline in COVID-19 activity. Flu cases have also declined steeply after an early peak in November, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity remains high but is decreasing in people and children under 18.

Title: Expert Opinion: A FAQ on COVID-19 subvariant XBB.1.5
Publisher: Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
XBB.1.5 is a new COVID-19 subvariant that is rapidly spreading globally and is expected to become the next dominant strain. It is a descendant of the XBB subvariant, which emerged from the combination of two Omicron subvariants, BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75. XBB.1.5 is prevalent in at least 38 countries, with the highest prevalence in the US, accounting for about 43% of cases. It has also been detected in Canada, Europe, Asia, and other regions. XBB.1.5 is highly transmissible and immune-evasive, raising concerns about its impact on public health. Limited data suggests that it can cause serious illness, especially in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of current mRNA vaccines, including bivalent boosters, against XBB.1.5 is uncertain, with varying results from different studies. To protect against XBB.1.5, standard infection control measures such as indoor masking, social distancing, and handwashing are recommended. Antiviral medications may be considered for eligible high-risk patients. The use of available monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein may not be effective against this subvariant. The uncertainty surrounding XBB.1.5's impact underscores the ongoing challenge of managing COVID-19 and the importance of public health measures and surveillance.

Title: Real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron BA.2 variant in a SARS-CoV-2 infection-naive population
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the effectiveness of booster vaccinations, specifically with the mRNA or inactivated vaccines, in preventing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 infection. The study found that booster shots provided short-term protection against infection, with slightly higher initial effectiveness from the BNT162b2 vaccine followed by rapid waning. The CoronaVac vaccine, an inactivated vaccine, also showed some protection against Omicron infection, but the small number of vaccinees and the short duration of the study led to uncertainty in the estimates. The article also highlights the potential limitations of intramuscular vaccinations based on the original Wuhan strain in the long run, as the virus continues to evolve. The introduction of bivalent mRNA vaccines encoding the BA.5 spike protein is discussed, but the complex landscape of SARS-CoV-2 variants and immunity challenges the formulation and deployment of updated vaccines. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for frequent studies to quantify the protective effect of booster vaccinations and the potential benefits of reformulated bivalent boosters in increasing population immunity before new waves of infections.

Publisher: ICAO
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has issued new recommendations for countries regarding risk management and COVID-19-related air travel requirements. The guidance aims to balance the need for maintaining air connectivity with mitigating the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The recommendations emphasize that any pandemic-related restrictions should be based on evidence-based risk management and follow WHO and ICAO guidance. Countries are advised to regularly assess the risk, consider public health resources, ensure good communication, and balance public health risks with the need for travel. Additional recommendations include increasing global vaccination and recognizing air crew and civil aviation professionals as essential workers. The guidance also takes into account factors such as circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination levels, and the capacity of public health systems to manage new COVID-19 outbreaks. The ICAO's recommendations provide a framework for countries to make informed decisions about COVID-19-related air travel requirements while prioritizing the safety and well-being of travelers and the public.

Title: Large new review underscores the risks of Covid-19 during pregnancy
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A recent international review has found that pregnant women and their developing babies are at an increased risk of severe health outcomes if they contract COVID-19. The study, published in BMJ Global Health, analyzed data from 12 studies across several countries, including the United States, and concluded that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can lead to more adverse health effects for both the mother and the baby. Key findings include: About 3% of pregnant women with COVID-19 required intensive care, and about 4% needed critical care, a much higher proportion than pregnant women without COVID-19. Pregnant individuals with COVID-19 were nearly four times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, 15 times more likely to be ventilated, and seven times more likely to die compared to uninfected pregnant individuals. They also faced higher risks of pre-eclampsia, blood clots, and issues related to high blood pressure. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 had a higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. The study's lead author, Emily Smith, noted that the research underscores the importance of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, especially as many countries lack clear guidelines on this topic. Dr. Justin Lappen, an expert in Maternal Fetal Medicine, reinforced the study's findings and emphasized the need to prevent and treat COVID-19 in pregnant women, including the use of recommended therapies. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, these findings suggest that the risk of severe illness and hospitalization is significantly higher for pregnant women with COVID-19 compared to those without the infection. Therefore, encouraging and providing access to COVID-19 vaccinations during pregnancy can potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems by lowering the number of hospitalizations related to COVID-19 complications in pregnant women.

Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has attracted controversy over her handling of COVID-19 prosecutions and pardons. Initially, Smith advocated for amnesty for those who violated COVID-19 public health orders, but she has since backtracked, stating that she is leaving the decision-making to Crown prosecutors. Smith's comments have prompted accusations of interference in the administration of justice by the Opposition NDP, who have called for an independent investigation. While law professor Lorian Hardcastle notes that pardoning provisions exist at the federal level, Smith's office has stated that her government is not considering such legislation. Smith's involvement in the cases has been unclear, with contradictory statements and a lack of transparency surrounding her discussions with prosecutors. The article also highlights Smith's support for protesters against COVID-19 health restrictions and her characterization of the unvaccinated as a discriminated group.
