Title: COVID-19 in Ontario: What you need to know as we head into fall and winter
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
COVID-19 cases in Ontario are on the rise again, with case numbers climbing since early July and outbreaks increasing in long-term care homes, hospitals, and retirement homes. However, the number of COVID-19 patients in ICUs has remained stable, indicating that fewer people are becoming seriously ill. The increase in cases is likely due to waning immunity, as many people have not had a recent vaccine dose or infection. The upcoming flu and RSV seasons may also compound the impact on the healthcare system. Public health officials recommend that those in high-risk groups receive the latest COVID-19 vaccine, and that everyone gets an influenza shot when it becomes available in September. Masking is no longer mandated in most places, but it is still recommended in certain settings and can help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses. If you do get COVID-19, stay home until you feel better and wear a mask in public settings for 10 days from the onset of symptoms. Those at high risk should get tested and seek out medications like Paxlovid to reduce the risk of severe disease.

Here is a summary of the article: Increasing COVID-19 Infections and the Start of Respiratory Virus Season: Public health officials in Canada warn of climbing COVID-19 infection rates as the country enters the fall and winter respiratory virus season, with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza expected to circulate. Updated mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine by Moderna: Health Canada has authorized an updated COVID-19 vaccine by Moderna, targeting the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. The federal government is distributing the vaccine to provinces and territories for public rollout. Low Uptake of Bivalent Booster: According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, only 22% of individuals aged five and older received the bivalent booster offering protection against the Omicron variant. New Vaccine Targeting XBB.1.5 Subvariant: Moderna's Spikevax mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is now approved for individuals aged six months and older, targeting the XBB.1.5 subvariant. Health Canada is also reviewing updated versions of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Novavax vaccines. Importance of Updated Vaccines: Virologist Angela Rasmussen emphasizes that the updated vaccines specifically target the coronavirus subvariants circulating currently, including the XBB subvariants, which are derivatives of Omicron BA.2. Even individuals who received the bivalent booster are encouraged to get the new shot for additional protection. Protection Against Severe Disease: The updated vaccine provides temporary protection against infection and offers longer-lasting protection against developing severe disease, according to Rasmussen and Dr. Lawrence Loh, executive director of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. Hybrid Immunity and Vaccination: While some individuals may have hybrid immunity from a combination of vaccination and infection, immunity wanes over time. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, recommends getting the updated vaccine if it has been six months or longer since the last infection or booster. Flu and RSV Vaccines: In addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, flu shots will be available across Canada this fall. Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of getting the COVID-19 booster and flu shot simultaneously. There is currently no RSV vaccine for children, but a new vaccine, Arexvy, is available for adults 60 years and older. Prioritizing Vulnerable Populations: Provinces and territories are prioritizing high-risk populations, including seniors in long-term care, for vaccination before making the COVID-19 and flu shots available to the general public. Doctors and scientists emphasize the criticality of prioritizing vulnerable populations for vaccination. Timing of Vaccine Availability: The updated COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot are expected to be available in most of the country by October, with specific timing varying between provinces and territories.

Here is a summary of the article, along with some additional information to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: If you are sick, it is important to stay home and self-isolate to prevent the spread of the illness to others. This is especially important if you have COVID-19 or suspect that you may have been exposed to it. In most cases, you don't need to see a doctor for a cold or flu. Instead, focus on rest and hydration. However, if your symptoms worsen or persist, contact your medical provider. This is especially important if you have a high fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms. If you think you may have COVID-19 or have been in contact with a positive case, take a COVID self-assessment and follow the guidance provided. This can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying potential cases early and preventing further spread. If you live in residence or have roommates, try to limit your contact with others, wear a mask, and practice good hygiene, including regular handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. It is recommended to have a basic illness kit prepared, including items such as acetaminophen, cough and cold medicine, a thermometer, masks, and hand sanitizer. For University of Guelph staff and faculty who are unable to work due to respiratory illness, complete the Employee Self-Declaration Form. Medical documentation is required for absences of five days or more. Continue to take precautions even after your symptoms improve to help reduce the spread in your community. This includes wearing a mask, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to monitor the following factors: The number of new cases in your area: A surge in new cases can lead to an increase in hospitalizations. The positivity rate: A high positivity rate (the percentage of positive tests out of total tests conducted) indicates significant community transmission and can lead to more hospitalizations. The reproduction number (R0): This number indicates how contagious an infection is. If R0 is above 1, it means that each infected person is infecting more than one other person, leading to exponential growth and potential strain on healthcare resources. The vaccination rate: A higher vaccination rate can help reduce the severity of the disease and lower hospitalization rates. The availability of healthcare resources: The capacity of healthcare facilities to handle an influx of patients is crucial. A lack of hospital beds, ICU capacity, or healthcare staff can lead to overwhelmed healthcare systems and increased hospitalizations. By considering these factors and following the guidelines outlined in the article, individuals can play a role in helping to forecast and prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Here is a summary of the article: With the upcoming respiratory virus season, Manitoba Health recommends all Manitobans get an updated COVID-19 booster shot. Health Canada recently approved Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccine for Canadians aged six months and older. This new mRNA-based vaccine offers improved protection against the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. As in prior years, the initial shipments of the flu and COVID-19 vaccines will be prioritized for high-risk populations, including First Nations communities and those in long-term care. The vaccines are expected to be available to the general public by early to mid-October and can be accessed at pharmacies, medical clinics, and public health offices. Manitobans are advised to get the COVID-19 booster shot six months after their last vaccine dose or infection. Rapid COVID-19 tests remain freely available across the province, but their use is now recommended only for individuals at high risk of severe outcomes. This is because early treatment options, such as antivirals, are dependent on prompt diagnosis. As of September 9, approximately 77% of Manitoba residents have received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider factors such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of the new vaccine against emerging variants, and the expected uptake of the booster shots by the general public. The prioritization of high-risk populations for vaccination is a strategy to reduce the strain on the healthcare system, as these individuals are more likely to require hospitalization if infected. Overall, the availability of updated vaccines and the recommendation for booster shots are positive steps in managing COVID-19 hospitalizations in Manitoba.

Title: At-home COVID-19 tests: A Mayo Clinic expert answers questions on expiration dates and the new variants
Publisher: Mayo Clinic
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article provides insights and guidance from Dr. Matthew Binnicker, Ph.D., director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, on the use and reliability of at-home COVID-19 tests. Here's a summary: At-home COVID-19 tests are useful for detecting active COVID-19 infections. Original expiration dates on at-home tests were set arbitrarily due to the rapid development of tests. Manufacturers have since updated expiration dates based on prolonged assessments. Before discarding expired tests, check the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for updated expiration date information. A positive result on an expired test is likely reliable, but a negative result may not be. Dr. Binnicker recommends retesting with a new test or seeking a lab-based test if the expired test result is negative. At-home tests can detect currently circulating COVID-19 strains, including new variants, as the changes in the virus primarily affect the spike protein, while the antigen tests detect a different protein with fewer mutations. A positive at-home antigen test indicates a person is likely contagious and spreading the virus to others. If an at-home test is negative but COVID-19 symptoms persist, Dr. Binnicker recommends visiting a healthcare provider for a swab collection and PCR-based test for a more reliable result. Recommended instances for testing include developing COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, or planning to visit a person at high risk of severe illness. After potential virus exposure, Dr. Binnicker suggests waiting a few days before testing, as it takes time for the virus to reach detectable levels. Testing negative by day five after exposure indicates a lower likelihood of infection. Fluctuating temperatures can affect test accuracy. Refer to the information packet for acceptable storage conditions to ensure test accuracy.

Title: Are Chills a Sign of COVID-19?
Publisher: Health.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Chills and fever are both symptoms of COVID-19, but they are not specific to the virus and can be seen in other infections like influenza or bacterial pneumonia. COVID-19 symptoms can vary depending on the variant and vaccination status, but common symptoms include congestion, cough, fatigue, fever, headache, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell. Fever is often caused by an infection, and the body releases inflammatory chemicals to fight the illness, raising the body's temperature. Chills are not a standalone symptom and usually occur with other symptoms like fever, shivering, muscle aches, and headache. If chills occur with symptoms such as abdominal pain, confusion, shortness of breath, or a stiff neck, it is important to seek medical attention. While chills themselves cannot be treated, the fever and infection causing them can be managed with medication and proper hydration. Fever-reducing medications only mask the symptoms and do not cure the infection. COVID-19 testing is necessary to confirm a diagnosis, especially if symptoms include chills, fever, dry cough, and muscle aches. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to monitor the prevalence of symptoms like chills and fever in the population. Tracking the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns can help healthcare systems prepare for potential surges in hospitalizations. Additionally, understanding the range of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including less common ones like confusion and abdominal pain, can help individuals seek medical attention when needed and prevent more severe cases that require hospitalization.
