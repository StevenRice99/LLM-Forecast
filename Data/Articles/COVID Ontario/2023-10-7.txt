Title: Symptoms, transmission and treatment (COVID-19)
Publisher: Gouvernement du Québec
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article provides a list of symptoms that may indicate a COVID-19 infection and help with forecasting hospitalizations due to the virus. These symptoms can vary in severity and duration, lasting from less than 14 days to over a month, and in some cases, leading to long COVID-19 with persistent symptoms or complications. Fever, sudden loss of smell with or without taste, cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing are all potential indicators of COVID-19 and reasons to seek medical advice. Other symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, headache, extreme fatigue, muscle pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach ache, and diarrhea, when present in combination (two or more), could also be indicative of COVID-19 and warrant consultation with a healthcare professional. The presence and severity of these symptoms can help healthcare providers and public health officials forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations. It is important to remain vigilant and consult with medical professionals when in doubt, especially for infants under 6 months old who may present with different or less specific symptoms.

Title: Ask an expert: Fall is bringing an expected rise in COVID-19 cases, but one dominated by Omicron's close cousin
Publisher: Dal News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the rise of new COVID-19 subvariants, primarily EG.5, which has become the dominant strain globally and accounts for a significant portion of new cases in the United States. EG.5 is a subvariant of the Omicron variant that first emerged in November 2021 and is highly transmissible. While the severity of these new subvariants is still under investigation, the symptoms they cause are similar to those of previous strains, including congestion, headaches, fatigue, sore throat, coughing, and changes in smell. Dr. Joanne Langley, an expert in infectious diseases, provides insights into the current state of COVID-19 in Canada. She mentions that the XBB subvariants, including EG.5, are the most common ones circulating in the country. These subvariants are generally more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus. While there may be an increase in cases during the fall and winter months, public health surveillance is in place to monitor hospital admissions and outpatient visits due to COVID-19. To combat these new subvariants, Health Canada has authorized a Moderna vaccine targeting the XBB.1.5 subvariant for individuals aged six months and older. This vaccine is expected to provide protection against the currently circulating strains, and each province and territory will announce its vaccination plans. The guidance on when to get the next shot depends on the vaccines already received, and eligible individuals are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

New Brunswick's Department of Health has announced that residents can book appointments for the updated COVID-19 vaccine and their annual flu shot starting Friday. The new Moderna COVID vaccine will be available to everyone aged six months and older from October 16 onwards, as long as six months have passed since their last dose or COVID infection. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines are expected to arrive in late October or early November. These updated vaccines target the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, which is currently circulating. Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health, recommends that New Brunswickers stay up-to-date with their vaccines as COVID-19 continues to circulate. Public Health strongly recommends the updated vaccine for those aged 65 and older, pregnant individuals, people with underlying medical conditions, those living in long-term care facilities, healthcare workers, and individuals of First Nations, Métis, or Inuit descent. Dr. Yves Léger, the acting deputy chief medical officer of health, expressed concern about the drop in COVID vaccine uptake over time. He emphasized that vaccines are an important tool in protecting against COVID-19, which is expected to be a long-term presence. Léger anticipates an increase in COVID activity this fall and winter, based on the experience of Australia, which often predicts trends for North America. The province reported that COVID activity is currently moderate, with an increase in hospitalizations and deaths in recent weeks. Public Health encourages the use of masks, especially during the respiratory season when COVID and flu cases are expected to rise, to protect those at higher risk of severe complications. The launch of the vaccine campaign follows criticism of the province for its lack of communication about fall plans. New Brunswickers are also encouraged to book appointments for the flu shot and pneumococcal vaccine, which can be administered alongside the COVID vaccine.

Here is a summary of the article: In anticipation of a rise in respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and the flu, the Ministry of Health has reintroduced a mask mandate in specific healthcare settings while also offering guidance on COVID-19 vaccinations. The key points include: Mask mandate: Masks are mandatory for healthcare workers, volunteers, contractors, and visitors in hospitals and certain medical facilities, including long-term care and seniors' assisted living centers. Patients in hospitals are not required to wear masks unless clinically necessary. PPE and critical supplies: Doctors' offices can continue to order PPE through the Health PPE Portal at no cost. Immunization requirements: Health care workers must still comply with COVID-19 immunization requirements per Provincial Health Officer orders and employer policies. Vaccination is also mandatory for new healthcare workers. Unvaccinated healthcare workers are prohibited from working in hospitals and long-term care homes. COVID-19 vaccinations in doctors' offices: Doctors can now offer COVID-19 vaccines to patients alongside flu shots. They are advised to contact their local Medical Health Officer for information on ordering vaccines and becoming a vaccine provider. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of the mask mandate and vaccination requirements in healthcare settings. The measures aim to protect vulnerable populations and prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, which could help reduce hospitalizations. Additionally, the availability of COVID-19 vaccines in doctors' offices may contribute to increased vaccination rates, which could further reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

Here is a summary of the article: Quebec's Department of Health and Social Services reports that over 100 long-term care homes in the province are currently dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks, defined as two or more cases. One of the affected facilities, Maimonides Geriatric Centre, is managing an outbreak across several floors, with eight residents currently infected. A family member of a resident has expressed concern about the lack of mandatory mask policies and the potential for residents to have gone a year without a COVID-19 booster shot. In response, a spokesperson for the CIUSS West Central Montreal has stated that COVID-positive residents are being isolated and that protective equipment guidelines are in place for anyone entering affected rooms. The spokesperson also mentioned that the fall flu and COVID-19 vaccination campaign will begin later this week across all their long-term care centers. Employees at the facility report that masks are only mandatory on floors with active outbreaks, and a union representative stated that they have not received any complaints from employees regarding the handling of the COVID-19 protocol. However, some family members remain concerned for their loved ones' well-being. Experts like cardiologist Christopher Labos recommend the continued use of masks in long-term care homes, emphasizing their low cost and effectiveness in reducing respiratory virus transmission. Labos also encourages individuals to consider receiving the updated COVID-19 vaccine along with their annual flu vaccine. Quebec's fall COVID-19 and flu vaccination campaign is set to begin on October 10. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vulnerability of long-term care home residents, the potential impact of booster shots, and the effectiveness of preventive measures such as masking and vaccination campaigns. The situation in Quebec's long-term care homes underscores the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19 and the importance of proactive measures to protect vulnerable populations.

Title: Researchers are still untangling the risks of catching COVID over and over
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the shift in the COVID-19 pandemic from the early days when it wreaked havoc on healthcare systems to the present, where hospitalizations and ICU admissions due to the virus are at much lower levels. Scientists attribute this positive shift to high rates of previous infections and multiple rounds of vaccinations, providing a significant change in the severity of acute illness. However, it is noted that COVID-19 continues to circulate, causing repeat infections, and the long-term health impacts remain uncertain. While the risk of life-threatening infections has decreased for most, it is still high for older people, especially those in nursing homes and the unvaccinated. The article also highlights the lopsided impact of COVID-19 on the elderly and those with multiple pre-existing medical conditions, with a higher risk of ICU admission or death. Additionally, there is a chance of lingering symptoms, worsened mental health issues, and an elevated risk of heart attacks or strokes, even in younger and healthier individuals. While the exact rates of long COVID are elusive, studies suggest that the percentage of people acquiring some form of long COVID may be lower than previously thought. Vaccination and prior infection are believed to reduce the risk of long COVID, but the condition is not yet fully understood and can have debilitating consequences for some. Experts advise that basic precautions, such as updated vaccinations, wearing masks in closed settings, and improving indoor air quality, can help reduce individual risk and maintain hospital capacity. While COVID-19 may have subdued, it remains ever-present, and individuals should acknowledge its potential consequences while navigating this new phase of the pandemic.
