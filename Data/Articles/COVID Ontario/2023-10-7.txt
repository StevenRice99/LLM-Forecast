The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the values most important for forecasting: COVID-19 hospitalizations across Canada have increased from nearly 1,500 to more than 2,700 since August. The proportion of patients in intensive care has remained around 3%, which is below the peaks seen in previous waves. Ontario's rapid test distribution program for retailers ended in June, but local public health units may still have tests available. There are currently more than 90 million rapid tests in the federal inventory, with approximately 700,000 set to expire by the end of the year. These values suggest an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, but with a relatively stable intensive care rate. The availability of rapid tests in Ontario may impact the ability to track and forecast hospitalizations.
