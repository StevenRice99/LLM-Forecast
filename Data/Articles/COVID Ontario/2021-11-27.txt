This article provides evidence-based recommendations on the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab + imdevimab, and sotrovimab) for adults in Ontario, Canada. The recommendations are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they outline the criteria for using these treatments in various patient populations, including those who are critically and moderately ill, mildly ill, and those who have been exposed to COVID-19. Key values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: The use of casirivimab + imdevimab at a dose of 2400 mg IV for critically and moderately ill patients who are within 9 days of onset of any COVID-19 symptom and have demonstrated rapid clinical deterioration. The use of casirivimab + imdevimab at a dose of 1200 mg IV or SC or sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg IV for mildly ill patients who are within 7 days of onset of any COVID-19 symptom and have at least one underlying risk factor. The use of casirivimab + imdevimab at a dose of 1200 mg IV or SC or sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg IV for post-exposure prophylaxis in patients who are at high-risk to progress to moderate or severe COVID-19.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Modeling suggests Ontario intensive care units could be treating around 200 COVID-19 patients by January. The trigger point for hospitals to ramp down non-urgent procedures is now closer to 250 or 300 intensive care patients, up from 150 patients previously. Current intensive care occupancy is around 130 patients, with 137 people in critical care as of Wednesday. Vaccinations are expected to help prevent more people from getting severely ill with breakthrough infections. Health human resources is the largest "rate limiting step" for intensive care capacity, with low staff numbers, burnout, and distress among remaining staff. Variables to watch include booster doses for more people and vaccinations for younger children. Localized surgery cancellations are more likely than provincewide cancellations. These values can be used to inform forecasting models and provide context for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa reported 28 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, with 356 known active cases and 614 deaths. The Western Quebec School Board will hold vaccination clinics in some schools to provide at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to every child between the ages of five and 11 before the winter holiday. Ski hills in the greater Ottawa-Gatineau area are selling out of season passes, indicating a surge in popularity of outdoor activities during the pandemic. As of Saturday, Ottawa has had 31,606 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 30,636 cases considered resolved. Public health officials have reported more than 58,700 COVID-19 cases across eastern Ontario and western Quebec, including more than 56,800 cases now resolved. The province's vaccine passport is required for people of an eligible vaccine age in many public places, and people can show paper, PDF, or QR code proof. Private gathering limits are 25 people inside and 100 people outside in eastern Ontario, while in western Quebec, 10 people are allowed to gather inside private residences and 20 people outdoors. Vaccines curb the spread of all variants of COVID-19 and go a long way toward avoiding deaths and hospitalizations, without offering total protection. Four COVID-19 vaccines have been deemed safe and approved in Canada, with the two most common approved for youth as young as 12. Health Canada is expected to announce the approval of the first vaccine for children as young as five. Ontario and Quebec are giving certain groups third doses, with over 3.6 million COVID-19 first, second, and third vaccine doses administered in the wider Ottawa-Gatineau region. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide information on the current number of cases, vaccination efforts, and public health measures in place to mitigate the spread of the virus.
