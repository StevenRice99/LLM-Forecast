Title: Evidence-Based Recommendations on the Use of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies (Casirivimab + Imdevimab, and Sotrovimab) for Adults in Ontario
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Based on the provided text, I will summarize the key points related to managing AmAb (Antibody Monoclonal) shortages.
Key Points: 
1. Stage 3 Rationing: If Stage 1 and 2 efforts are insufficient to meet demand, Ontario should proceed to Stage 3 and use a fair procedure to choose between COVID-19 patients of equal need for secondary prioritization of casirivimab + imdevimab.
2. Provincial Management: Stage 3 rationing should be managed provincially, ideally through an Inventory Management System (IMS).
3. Fair Rationing: A logic-based mechanism should be used to fairly ration casirivimab + imdevimab among eligible COVID-19 patients.
4. Eligibility Criteria: AmAbs should be given to COVID-19 patients with a reasonable chance of benefiting from it, based on consensus among those involved in assessing eligibility.
5. Alternatives to First-Come, First-Served: A strictly first-come, first-served approach is not recommended, as it would favor patients presenting to centers with known AmAb supply and exacerbate health inequities.
6. Options for Stage 3:
A second-opinion or consensus model among those responsible for assessing eligibility should be considered to mitigate potential bias.
An allocation lottery could be used as a fair default procedure for choosing among eligible COVID-19 patients where allocation based on maximizing benefits cannot be determined.
Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these points!

Relevant.
Pregnant individuals are at higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 illness. Risk of hospitalization is 4.7% (7% pregnant vs 1.5% non-pregnant). Pregnant individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 are almost three times as likely to be admitted to ICU.
