Here is a summary of the article: Headline: Experts Debate the Effectiveness of Plastic Dividers in Preventing COVID-19 Spread Summary: Plastic dividers and plexiglass barriers were initially widely used by businesses to separate customers from staff and prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, twenty months into the pandemic, one of Ontario's top advisors, Dr. Peter Jüni, has stated that these plastic dividers may be ineffective and even counterproductive. Dr. Jüni and other experts like Professor Jeffrey Siegel argue that the broad use of fixed plastic barriers in public spaces can impede ventilation and give people a false sense of security. They recommend using plexiglass barriers only in direct customer-service environments, such as checkout counters, where they can effectively limit exposure. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business calls for clarity on the issue, as previous guidelines recommended plexiglass barriers, and businesses should be compensated if advice changes. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, still supports the use of physical barriers like plexiglass to decrease transmission risk. Key Facts for COVID-19 Hospitalization Forecasting: Plastic dividers and plexiglass barriers may not significantly impact reducing COVID-19 spread and could even be counterproductive by impeding ventilation. Experts recommend reserving plexiglass use for specific customer-service environments, such as checkout counters, where they can effectively limit exposure. Proper ventilation and airflow are crucial in reducing the spread of COVID-19, and the incorrect use of barriers can hinder these efforts. The presence of physical barriers has been prescribed in regulations for reopening businesses, so any change in advice should be clearly communicated, and businesses compensated for their investments. This information could be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it highlights the potential ineffectiveness of plastic dividers and the need for clear guidance on infection prevention measures. The focus on ventilation and airflow also underscores the importance of considering environmental factors in predicting and managing COVID-19 transmission and hospitalizations.

Dr. Caroline Colijn, a mathematics professor at SFU, has been using her expertise in infectious disease modeling to help understand and control the COVID-19 pandemic. She leads the MAGPIE Research Group, which applies mathematical models to the fields of epidemiology and pathogen evolution. Throughout the pandemic, Dr. Colijn has collaborated with public health organizations such as the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and the Public Health Agency of Canada to inform the COVID-19 response. Her research articles have gained significant attention, and she has provided valuable insights to the general public through media appearances. One of her most-cited articles discusses the emergence and future of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Dr. Colijn explains that genetic sequencing is crucial for understanding COVID-19 variants and their transmission dynamics. By analyzing the RNA of the virus, scientists can identify different variants and track their spread. She predicts that in the next year, the evolution of the virus will favor variants that can infect vaccinated individuals, but notes that our broad immunity and effective vaccines provide protection. Regarding the future of the pandemic, Dr. Colijn believes that COVID-19 will be endemic and coexist with humans, similar to the flu. However, she is hopeful that vaccination efforts will allow us to reopen and establish a "new normal." This new normal may include ongoing mitigation measures such as hand washing, improved ventilation, and staying home when sick. Dr. Colijn reflects on the busy and challenging nature of the past 18 months, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to the public understanding of COVID-19 through her research and media appearances.

Title: How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and how companies have adapted to the challenges. In May 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, companies faced disruptions in their supply chains due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. A survey of senior supply-chain executives revealed that 93% of respondents planned to make their supply chains more flexible, agile, and resilient. A follow-up survey conducted in the second quarter of 2021 showed that companies had taken steps to improve the resilience of their supply chains. Most companies focused on increasing inventories of critical products and components. Different industries responded differently to the resilience challenge, with healthcare players leading in applying a broad range of measures. The pandemic highlighted the importance of supply-chain risk management, with 95% of companies now having formal risk-management processes. Companies with higher maturity in risk management focused on implementing new practices, while those with less experience invested in new software tools. The transition to remote working during the pandemic emphasized the importance of digital tools and advanced analytics in supply-chain planning. Companies that used advanced analytics reported better supply-chain planning performance. The crisis also accelerated digitization efforts in supply chains, with a focus on improving visibility and real-time performance monitoring. Despite progress, challenges remain, such as talent gaps in digital skills and the need for end-to-end transparency in supply chains. The coming months are crucial for supply-chain leaders to continue adapting their supply chains, modernizing technologies, and building capabilities to remain competitive and resilient in the face of future disruptions.

Posted: 5 days ago
The study, published in The Journal of the American Dental Association, found that dentists may be less likely to contract COVID-19 compared to the general population. The incidence rate of COVID-19 among dentists was estimated to be lower than that of the general public during the same period. The results suggest that the risk of COVID-19 infection for dentists may be relatively low, potentially due to factors such as personal protective equipment, increased awareness, and extra caution outside of work. However, the study also notes that the risk of COVID-19 infection may vary in different parts of the world, with a slightly higher rate of infection observed in European jurisdictions. The study's findings can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of current safety measures and determine if any adjustments are necessary to ensure the continued safety of dentists, staff, and patients. Overall, the study adds to the evidence that dental care is safe and that the dental profession has been successful in adapting to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
