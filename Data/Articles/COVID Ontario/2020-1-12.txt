A 61-year-old man has died from pneumonia in Wuhan, China, due to a then-unknown virus, now identified as a new type of coronavirus. As of January 11, 41 people had been diagnosed with the virus, with 7 in critical condition. This information is important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it provides a baseline understanding of the virus's severity and its ability to spread. The Wuhan health authority stated that no new cases had been detected since January 3, and that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) cautioned that the virus could be a new type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that includes the deadly SARS and MERS viruses. The outbreak occurred ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January when many people in China travel, increasing the potential for the virus to spread. The Chinese government expected nearly 500 million trips to be made during this time. While the Wuhan health authority stated that no medical staff had been infected and there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the potential for increased travel during the Lunar New Year could have heightened the risk for more infections and hospitalizations.

Title: Comparative therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir and combination lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The study aimed to compare the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir (RDV) with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and interferon beta (IFNb) in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection. In vitro studies were conducted using human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) to assess antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity, while in vivo studies were performed using a transgenic mouse model with improved pharmacokinetics for nucleotide prodrugs. RDV demonstrated superior antiviral efficacy compared to LPV/RTV and IFNb in vitro, with a higher selectivity index. In vivo prophylactic studies showed that RDV reduced lung viral titers and improved survival rates compared to vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb, and IFNb alone. Therapeutic studies also showed that RDV treatment improved survival rates and reduced lung viral titers compared to other treatment regimens. The study provides valuable data to justify further testing in nonhuman primates and inform future human clinical trials for MERS-CoV treatment.

Taiwan has been one of the most successful countries in the world at containing COVID-19, with only 812 cases and seven deaths as of January 4, 2021. President Tsai Ing-wen attributes this success to several factors, including early and prudent action, rapid response, and the mobilization of resources. Taiwan's experience in disease prevention from fighting SARS and other epidemics also played a significant role. The country implemented border quarantine, early diagnosis, contact tracing, and public education programs, while also partnering with domestic manufacturers to become the world's second-largest producer of face masks. President Tsai emphasizes the importance of creating a shared sense of purpose and inspiring unity among the people. Taiwan's existing national healthcare system and advanced digital capabilities helped create a comprehensive safety net to track and monitor the virus. The government also prioritized providing timely and transparent information to the public, holding daily press conferences and utilizing social media to build trust and clarify policies. Taiwan was able to avoid lockdown measures by acting quickly and deploying resources early on. The combination of their defensive strategies and the collaboration of the public and private sectors effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19. President Tsai also highlights the importance of effective leadership, which requires a range of character traits and skills that transcend gender.

Here is a summary of the article:The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, leading to increased risks of suicide. Access to firearms for those in distress heightens the lethality of suicide attempts. Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) are vital in preventing gun suicides, and many states have seen an increase in calls to suicide hotlines during the pandemic.ERPOs have been adapted during the pandemic to ensure they can still be sought and issued, with some states classifying them as essential court proceedings. As of April 2020, several states allowed remote ERPO hearings and filings, while others gave local districts discretion over whether ERPO petitions are essential.To facilitate access to ERPOs during social distancing, courts are recommended to classify ERPOs as essential proceedings and permit remote filings and hearings. Resources are available for those in crisis, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Crisis Text Line.This article highlights the importance of ERPOs in preventing suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic and provides recommendations for courts to improve access to these protective orders. It also offers resources for individuals in crisis or those concerned about a loved one's mental health.Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide direct information. However, the focus on mental health and suicide prevention during the pandemic could indirectly impact hospitalization rates. Mental health crises, including suicide attempts, often result in hospitalizations, especially when firearms are involved.

Title: How we fail black patients in pain
Publisher: AAMC
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the disturbing findings that many medical students and residents hold false beliefs about racial differences in pain sensitivity and physiology, which can lead to disparities in pain treatment. The author, an expert in pain management, argues that these disparities are not intentional but rather the result of complex influences, including implicit biases that providers may not even be aware of. The article outlines steps that individuals and institutions can take to address these biases and improve equitable pain treatment, including collecting data on pain management by patient race, ethnicity, and other characteristics, identifying and addressing personal biases, implementing educational programs, using clinical guidelines and standardized checklists, and continuing to search for objective measures of pain. The author emphasizes the importance of dispelling racist misinformation and stereotypes and addressing unconscious biases to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in pain treatment.

Title: COVID-19 has caused a rise in hot dog sales
Publisher: Supermarket Perimeter
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Hot dog sales have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales up to 127% compared to the same period in 2019. Beef hot dogs, which account for 60% of sales, saw the highest growth at 36%. Consumers are buying hot dogs in various package sizes, with larger packages performing well during the outbreak. While eight-pack hot dogs are the most common, sales grew the least compared to other sizes. This data suggests that consumers are buying hot dogs in bulk, which could be due to stockpiling or a shift towards more at-home meals. The surge in hot dog sales is likely due to a combination of factors, including consumers seeking comfort foods, the ease and versatility of hot dogs, and the affordability compared to other proteins. As the pandemic continues, hot dog sales may remain elevated, particularly if consumers continue to eat more meals at home. This trend could positively impact the meat industry and retailers, but it is challenging to forecast as consumer behavior can change rapidly during a crisis.

Title: Could llama antibodies treat viruses like COVID-19?
Publisher: Understanding Animal Research
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the potential of using antibodies, specifically nanobodies from llamas, as a treatment for COVID-19. Here are the key points:The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, and there is a lack of effective therapeutic solutions.Researchers are exploring the use of antibodies as a first-line treatment for COVID-19, harnessing the body's natural immune response to the virus.Antibodies are large molecules produced by plasma cells that can recognize and neutralize pathogens, including viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).Nanobodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, can be used to target the virus more effectively and may be able to cross the blood-brain barrier.Researchers at the University of Reading are studying nanobodies produced by llamas, which have shown potential in neutralizing the coronavirus.The FDA approved the first nanobody-based drug last year, and drug companies are exploring their use in treating cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and immune diseases.On May 11, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin found that antibodies from llamas effectively neutralize the coronavirus by binding to its spike protein.The group plans to conduct preclinical research in animals before moving on to human clinical trials.In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the development of effective antibody treatments, including nanobodies, could potentially reduce the severity of the disease and lower hospitalization rates. However, it is important to note that this is an emerging area of research, and the availability and effectiveness of such treatments can vary over time and across different populations.
