This article is not directly relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it primarily discusses employment law, workplace policies, and travel advisories related to COVID-19, rather than providing data or insights on hospitalization trends or predictive factors. However, the article does mention the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario (20) as of the time of writing, which could be a useful data point for forecasting hospitalizations. Nevertheless, the article's focus is not on hospitalization forecasting, so I would rate its relevance as low. If I had to extract some potentially useful information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, I would highlight the following: The number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario (20) as of the time of writing. The fact that some Canadian employers are taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as self-quarantining employees who have traveled to infected areas, which could potentially impact hospitalization rates. The mention of travel advisories for several countries, which could influence the number of imported cases and potentially impact hospitalization rates in Ontario. However, these points are not directly related to hospitalization forecasting, and the article does not provide sufficient information to make it a valuable resource for this purpose. Rating: FALSE (not directly relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada)
