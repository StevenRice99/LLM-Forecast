Title: Conscripted to care: Women’s experiences during COVID-19
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the gender dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Canada, highlighting the contributions and sacrifices made by women healthcare workers, educators, and parents. The research, conducted by Simon Fraser University professor Julia Smith, is presented in her book, "Conscripted to Care: Women on the Frontlines of the COVID-19 Response." Here are the key points from the article: Women comprised 75% of healthcare workers in Canada and shouldered the majority of caregiving responsibilities at home and in the community during the pandemic. Moral distress was a significant issue for women healthcare workers, arising from the inability to provide adequate care due to external constraints such as time and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols. This moral distress led to poor health and burnout among women in the healthcare profession. Statistics Canada data revealed that more women than men died from COVID-19 in Canada, possibly due to age and the higher proportion of women in frontline professions. The pandemic had secondary effects on women's employment, with women losing more jobs initially and taking longer to regain pre-pandemic employment levels compared to men. Women's unpaid care work at home, such as cleaning, cooking, childcare, and elder care, played a crucial role in Canada's economic recovery and filled gaps in health and social services. The pandemic catalyzed policy changes around childcare and investments in organizations addressing gender-based violence, but more needs to be done to improve accessibility and sustain funding. Governments need to increase investments in the healthcare system and the care economy, address gender inequalities in these sectors, and rectify issues such as gender pay gaps and inadequate sick pay and benefits. Overall, the article emphasizes the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women, particularly those in healthcare and caregiving roles, and calls for policy changes to address gender inequalities and ensure the safety, shelter, and security of all citizens.

Title: Elderly Canadians remain at higher risk of serious COVID from first infections, study suggests
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses new Canadian data indicating that a significant portion of the population has likely been infected with COVID-19, but more than 40% of elderly adults may have avoided infection so far, putting them at higher risk for hospitalization and death. The study conducted in British Columbia's Lower Mainland found that seniors aged 80 and older had a higher risk of serious outcomes as many had not been infected by the virus. The lead investigator emphasized the importance of prioritizing seniors in vaccination campaigns, especially with updated COVID shots tailored to current virus strains. The study highlights the ongoing risk for severe outcomes among older adults, despite a decrease in risks across all age groups over the course of the pandemic. Experts stress the importance of seniors considering vaccination, as evidence suggests a combination of vaccination and prior infection can lower the risk of severe outcomes. Focused vaccination campaigns targeting seniors are crucial to ensure their protection. While the study's findings may represent a worst-case scenario due to potential limitations in estimating prior infections, it's still recommended for high-risk individuals, including seniors, to continue taking basic precautions such as getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene, wearing masks, and socializing in smaller groups. Managing underlying health conditions and seeking prompt care if symptoms worsen are also important for reducing the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

Title: Was COVID-19 managed based on science, public opinion or the emotions of decision-makers?
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the role of scientific projections and expert influence in shaping public policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the example of Quebec. It argues that while scientific projections are crucial for policymaking, especially in epidemiology and climatology, their influence is just one among many factors in a democratic context. During the early waves of the pandemic, expert projections held significant sway in Quebec, but their influence waned over time despite dire predictions. The article suggests that high levels of uncertainty may have induced fear in policymakers and the public, leading them to initially subscribe to worst-case scenarios. However, as the crisis persisted, a degree of fatalism set in, inadvertently fueled by these projections, causing their credibility and influence to diminish over time. The article also explores the role of uncertainty and emotions in pandemic management. While most people expect crisis management to be grounded in rational choices informed by scientific evidence, the authors find that public support and negative emotions also played a significant role in influencing the stringency of measures during the second, third, and fourth waves. They suggest that an increase in stringency could be fueled by negative sentiments, pushing the severity of health measures beyond what is necessary given the available evidence. The analysis of press conference transcripts from Quebec decision-makers reveals that the lower the level of scientific evidence, the stricter the measures were. Additionally, leaders increased the stringency of public health measures during periods when they expressed heightened negative emotions. Paradoxically, the evidence had a greater impact on the severity of measures when leaders also expressed more uncertainty. Overall, the article concludes that scientific rationality did not prevail exclusively during the pandemic, and that policymaking was influenced by a combination of scientific projections, public support, negative emotions, and uncertainty. Here are the important facts from the article to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Scientific projections based on mathematical modeling and statistics are crucial for shaping public policy, especially in epidemiology and climatology. During the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, high levels of uncertainty may have induced fear, leading policymakers and the public to subscribe to worst-case scenarios. The institute for excellence in health and social services (INESSS) in Quebec provided projections on future hospitalizations, and stricter policies were implemented when significant increases in hospitalizations were anticipated. During the second and fourth waves, the projections and policy stringency followed a similar trajectory, and public support for sanitary measures was high. However, as the pandemic endured and vaccination rates increased, both the public and policymakers became accustomed to the dangers, and the stringent measures demanded significant sacrifices. During the fifth wave with the Omicron variant, projections from INESSS modelers lost their influence, and for the first time, public support for restrictions dropped, resulting in less severe measures despite dire projections. Analysis of press conferences revealed that lower levels of scientific evidence and heightened negative emotions expressed by leaders were associated with stricter public health measures. Uncertainty and negative emotions, such as fear, can influence policymaking and potentially lead to overreactions. These facts can provide insights into the factors that may influence policymaking and public support during a pandemic and can be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and the potential impact on healthcare systems.

Title: Ready for a booster? Ontario rolling out new flu and COVID-19 vaccines
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False

Ontario is offering new COVID-19 boosters to anyone aged six months or older, along with annual flu shots, to reduce hospitalizations during the winter when respiratory illnesses are more common. The province is encouraging people, especially the elderly and immunocompromised, to get vaccinated against both COVID-19 and the flu. Last winter, Ontario experienced high rates of respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, with a "triple threat" of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Children's hospitals were overwhelmed, and flu and RSV cases peaked in early December, straining the healthcare system. The new COVID-19 booster vaccines target the latest XBB variant and are recommended for those eligible who last had COVID-19 or a shot more than six months ago. The province has also introduced a free RSV vaccine program for those 60+ in long-term care. Health officials aim to keep hospitalizations low this winter by promoting vaccine accessibility and encouraging Ontarians to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu.
