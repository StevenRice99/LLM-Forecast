Title: Understanding COVID-19-associated coagulopathy
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the role of vascular endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, particularly in the development of thrombosis and organ damage. Key points include: Under normal circumstances, the vascular endothelium prevents platelet activation and coagulation. SARS-CoV-2 infection can disrupt the function of the vascular endothelium, contributing to COVID-19 vasculopathy. The virus binds to ACE2 receptors on lung epithelial cells, reducing their expression and causing local ACE2 deficiency. ACE2 regulates the kallikrein-kinin system, and its dysregulation can lead to increased vascular permeability, inflammation, fluid accumulation, and organ damage ("kinin storm"). Elevated D-dimer levels in severe COVID-19 cases suggest a role for fibrin deposition and degradation in the disease's pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 can affect multiple organs, including the brain, leading to neurological symptoms and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. While controversial, SARS-CoV-2 may directly infect brain tissue, and it can also affect the brain indirectly via host defense mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2-derived molecules may trigger neuroinflammatory and behavioral responses through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLR2 and TLR4. The article provides insights into the role of vascular endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 hospitalizations by highlighting the mechanisms through which it contributes to thrombosis, organ damage, and severe neurological manifestations. Understanding these pathways can help in developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.

Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the heightened risk of preventable harm to patients, healthcare workers, and the general public, revealing safety gaps within health systems at all levels. The rapid review explores the impacts of the pandemic on patient safety, specifically regarding diagnostic, treatment, and care management issues. Here are the key points from the article: The pandemic has had significant implications for patient safety, with a range of risks and avoidable harm identified. Diagnostic issues: The surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelmed healthcare systems, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment for both COVID-19 patients and those with other medical conditions. Misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses occurred due to the focus on COVID-19 and the reallocation of resources. Treatment and care management: Healthcare providers faced challenges in providing safe and effective treatment due to rapidly changing clinical guidelines, limited evidence on effective interventions, and the need for remote consultations. Medication errors and patient monitoring issues arose due to the strain on healthcare services and the rapid discharge of patients to create bed capacity. The pandemic also impacted mental health, with increased reports of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among patients and healthcare workers. Health system context: The pandemic exposed pre-existing weaknesses in health systems, including inadequate infection prevention and control practices, shortages of personal protective equipment, and limited healthcare workforce capacity. The rapid scaling up of emergency responses and the reallocation of resources during the pandemic disrupted established safety practices and increased safety risks. The review highlights the need for resilient health systems that can maintain patient safety standards during crises and emphasizes the importance of learning from the safety gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is essential to consider factors such as vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, and the availability and effectiveness of treatments. Additionally, understanding the capacity and resilience of healthcare systems, including their ability to implement infection control measures and manage patient surges, is crucial for predicting the impact on hospitalizations.

Publisher: News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Ontario Tech University Master of Science candidates Alana Tyner and Sarah Rijkenberg are collaborating with Dr. Andrea Kirkwood on an NSERC Alliance Missions Grant study to investigate the environmental consequences of the COVID-19-related urban exodus. The study is a response to the shift in human behavior since the pandemic began in March 2020, with people spending more time outdoors and in natural spaces. This has resulted in an increase in outdoor activities and a boom in cottage-building, placing new pressures on wildlife and leading to shoreline erosion. The two-year, $533,660 grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) will support research by experts from four universities: Ontario Tech, Carleton University, the University of Ottawa, and Toronto Metropolitan University. The goal is to develop a stronger understanding of the impacts on aquatic ecosystems and to create strategies for their protection. Dr. Kirkwood highlights the need for public education and the development of guidelines for cottagers and lake users to find an environmental balance, including potential amendments to watercraft speed limits and their distance from shorelines. The research has significant implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as the environmental pressures and human activities related to the pandemic are closely examined, providing insights into the behaviors and health of the population.

Title: Compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures is high among university-level students in Québec, Canada, CCDR 48(7/8)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures (COPM), including proper mask-wearing and physical distancing, is essential to curb the spread of the virus. A study was conducted in a Québec university library to evaluate students' compliance with COPM during the 2020-2021 academic year when in-person activities were restricted. Observations were made by trained observers at different time points over four weeks, and compliance was assessed as meeting both proper mask-wearing and physical distancing criteria. The overall compliance rate was high at 78.4%, and it increased over the weeks. However, there were differences in compliance based on the week, weekday, and time of day. Non-compliance was lower in weeks three and four compared to week one, higher on Sundays than Wednesdays, and higher at 6 p.m. than 10 a.m., although the latter difference was not statistically significant. Physical distancing non-compliance was rare. The high compliance rate is encouraging from a public health perspective and supports the idea that university libraries can remain open during the pandemic with strengthened COPM at specific times. This direct observation method provides valuable insights into students' behavior and can help university administrators and public health authorities make informed decisions about preventive measures.

Title: How COVID-19 lockdowns affected crime in Vancouver
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article discusses the research of Simon Fraser University (SFU) Professor Martin Andresen, a criminologist who studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns on crime in Vancouver, British Columbia. The study analyzed 10 types of crimes in 22 Vancouver neighborhoods and found that the pandemic did lead to significant changes in the types and numbers of crimes. One notable change was a decrease in property crime in downtown areas as businesses closed, which is explained by opportunity theory. However, property-related crimes increased in wealthier neighborhoods as people started working from home. The study also found that crimes associated with heightened anxiety and frustration, such as assaults, increased in downtown areas, which is attributed to social disorganization and a lack of social supports in these neighborhoods. In poverty-stricken neighborhoods, violent crime increased during the pandemic, highlighting the lack of economic resources and social supports in these areas. Andresen suggests that financial support during difficult times can help prevent crime, but the challenge lies in reaching those who need it most, such as individuals without stable addresses or bank accounts. As we move out of the pandemic, Andresen emphasizes the need to focus on marginalized populations and divert resources to help those in need. The pandemic has revealed the extra suffering experienced by marginalized communities and underscores the importance of economic and social supports to build a more resilient and just society. While the article does not directly forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it provides insights into the social and economic impacts of the pandemic, including the relationship between social cohesion, institutional support, and crime. The findings suggest that government interventions and financial support can play a crucial role in crime prevention, particularly in marginalized communities.

Title: Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19: Spotlight On 2SLGBTQ+ Communities in Canada
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article presents the findings of a series of bimonthly polls conducted by the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, starting from October 2020, to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and substance use of 2SLGBTQ+ communities. Here are the key findings and their potential implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Mental Health Impact: About one-quarter of 2SLGBTQ+ respondents reported excellent or very good mental health during the pandemic. However, rates varied significantly across different demographics. Only 13% of 2SLGBTQ+ youth and 9% of low-income 2SLGBTQ+ individuals reported good mental health. Additionally, around 46% of 2SLGBTQ+ respondents experienced moderate to severe anxiety symptoms in September 2021. These findings suggest that the pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, particularly youth and those with lower incomes. Poor mental health can indirectly influence COVID-19 hospitalization rates by affecting an individual's overall health and immune response. Substance Use: Approximately 30% of 2SLGBTQ+ respondents who consume alcohol and 20% of those who use cannabis reported increased consumption since the start of the pandemic. Increased substance use may lead to a higher risk of substance-related health issues, including respiratory problems, which could indirectly impact an individual's vulnerability to COVID-19 and subsequent hospitalization. Coping with Pandemic Stress: Only about half of the 2SLGBTQ+ respondents (48%) reported being able to cope with pandemic-related stress. This proportion was even lower for 2SLGBTQ+ youth (42%) and Black 2SLGBTQ+ individuals (35%). The inability to cope effectively with stress may lead to a range of mental health issues and could potentially influence an individual's ability to follow public health guidelines, seek timely medical attention, or manage COVID-19 symptoms if infected. Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Services: 30% of all 2SLGBTQ+ respondents and 40% of 2SLGBTQ+ youth accessed virtual mental health services during the pandemic, while fewer accessed in-person services. Even more concerning is the low rate of access to substance use treatment, especially among youth (only 7% of all 2SLGBTQ+ respondents and 5% of 2SLGBTQ+ youth). The reported top barrier to accessing these services was finances. The lack of access to mental health and substance use treatment may result in a higher risk of severe COVID-19 cases among 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, as underlying mental health issues and substance use disorders can worsen COVID-19 outcomes. Overall, these findings highlight the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on the mental health and substance use of 2SLGBTQ+ communities. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is essential to consider these factors and address the specific needs of 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, especially regarding mental health support and substance use treatment.

Title: Police-reported crime statistics in Canada, 2021
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: In 2021, there were over 2 million police-reported Criminal Code incidents in Canada, excluding traffic violations, representing a 1% increase in the police-reported crime rate from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact Canada's economy, healthcare system, and society in 2021, with restrictions and social distancing measures in place for much of the year. Canada's Crime Severity Index (CSI) remained stable in 2021, with a slight decrease from 73.9 in 2020 to 73.7. This stability resulted from a 5% increase in the Violent Crime Severity Index and a 1% decrease in the Property Crime Severity Index. The rate of police-reported drug offenses and impaired driving decreased in 2021 compared to 2020. The number of police-reported hate crimes increased by 27% in 2021, with a 72% increase over the last two years. The national homicide rate increased by 3% in 2021, with a higher rate among Indigenous peoples compared to non-Indigenous people. Four out of ten homicides in 2021 were firearm-related, and almost half of these were considered gang-related by police. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered, including vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, and the implementation of public health measures. Additionally, analyzing trends in hospitalization data and considering the capacity of the healthcare system can help in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Travel restrictions significantly reduced COVID-19 cases entering Canada — but insufficient to prevent new outbreaks
Publisher: UBC Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. It suggests that while travel restrictions implemented in the early stages of the pandemic significantly reduced the number of COVID-19 cases entering Canada, they were not enough to prevent new outbreaks. Here are some key facts from the article that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Travel restrictions were most effective when combined with other public health measures such as testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. The number of COVID-19 cases in Canada dropped by 38% in the first week of travel restrictions and by 90% in the sixth week. However, despite these measures, new outbreaks occurred in Canada due to community spread. The study suggests that a combination of travel restrictions and robust public health measures, including rapid testing and contact tracing, are necessary to control the spread of the virus and prevent new outbreaks. The findings highlight the importance of timely and comprehensive public health measures to prevent the establishment and spread of new COVID-19 outbreaks. Overall, the article suggests that while travel restrictions can be an effective tool in reducing the spread of COVID-19, they should be combined with other public health strategies to effectively control the pandemic and forecast hospitalizations accurately.

Title: The Municipal Role in Paramedic Services During COVID-19 and Beyond
Publisher: AMO
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key points that may help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and their impact on municipal implications: Paramedic services have played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking on additional responsibilities like testing, vaccinations, and community paramedicine. Municipalities, especially in northern regions where ambulance services are provided by District Social Service Administration Boards (DDSABs), face fiscal challenges due to rising paramedic service costs and call volumes. Prior to the pandemic, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) advocated for improvements to the paramedic dispatch system and community paramedicine through provincial government consultations. Community paramedicine, currently funded through pilot projects, provides primary health care and supports vulnerable populations, reducing pressure on the healthcare system. AMO and the Ontario Association of Paramedic Chiefs (OAPC) are advocating for permanent, full provincial funding. The primary request from AMO and OAPC is for the provincial health and long-term care ministries to establish a working group to develop a community paramedicine policy framework, with implementation starting in fall 2022. Municipalities currently contribute more than their share under the 50-50 cost-sharing arrangement with the province for paramedic services, indicating a need for funding reform. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and their impact on municipal paramedic services, key factors to consider include: Historical data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and the utilization of paramedic services during previous waves. The capacity of municipal paramedic services, including staffing levels, equipment, and transportation resources. The effectiveness of public health measures, such as vaccination rates and adherence to safety protocols, which can influence the spread of COVID-19 and the demand for paramedic services. The availability and utilization of community paramedicine programs, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations by providing primary care to vulnerable individuals in their homes. Collaboration between municipal, provincial, and healthcare stakeholders to develop surge capacity plans and coordinate resources effectively. By analyzing these factors and incorporating real-time data on COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and local trends, municipalities can forecast and prepare for potential impacts on paramedic services, including the need for additional resources or adjustments to service delivery models.

Title: COVID-19 vaccination rate lower among urban Indigenous people, study shows. Why?
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A new study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) found that COVID-19 vaccination rates among Ontario's urban Indigenous population were 20% lower than the general population, despite priority access. The study also showed that COVID-19 testing rates in Toronto and London, ON, were 10% higher among the Indigenous community. Barriers to vaccine uptake include access to culturally safe health centers, systemic racism in hospitals, and a lack of trust in biomedicine due to colonial policies. As of last week, over 86% of Canadians aged 5 and up have been fully vaccinated, while nearly half the total population has received a booster shot. The low vaccination rates in the Indigenous community are concerning given the potential for another wave this fall and winter, especially for those living in low-income and crowded settings. To increase vaccine uptake, community-led efforts and culturally sensitive approaches have been successful. Public health messaging and targeted promotion are key, and Indigenous-led programming and clinics have improved vaccination rates.
