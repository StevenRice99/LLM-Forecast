Title: Why 'waning immunity' from COVID-19 vaccines isn't as bad as it sounds
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the issue of breakthrough infections and vaccine efficacy in Canada. Despite some reports of fully vaccinated individuals contracting COVID-19, data from Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) shows that vaccines remain highly effective against severe outcomes, with those who are fully vaccinated being 79% less likely to be hospitalized and 64% less likely to die.
The article also highlights the importance of underlying conditions in determining the risk of breakthrough infections. Research has shown that older, frailer Canadians living with comorbidities, such as long-term care residents, are at increased risk of breakthrough infections due to declining antibody levels.
Experts stress that there is an important difference between infections and disease, and that even healthy individuals can get infected when antibody levels decline. However, this does not necessarily mean they will experience severe symptoms or require hospitalization.
The article also discusses the recent death of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell from COVID-19, which sparked debate about breakthrough infections and waning immunity. However, it notes that Powell was at heightened risk due to his underlying health condition, multiple myeloma.
Regarding booster shots, the article quotes experts as saying that they are not yet necessary for the general population in Canada. A recent study from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) found that protection against symptomatic infection does drop over time, but protection against severe outcomes remains high.
The article concludes that while some individuals may require booster shots, particularly those with underlying health conditions or immunocompromised states, it would be premature to provide boosters to the general population at this time.
