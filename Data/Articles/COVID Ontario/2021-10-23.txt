Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article provides context on the concept of waning immunity from COVID-19 vaccines, highlighting that while antibody levels may decline, the immune system's other forms of protection, such as memory B cells, remain effective in fighting off the virus. It also notes that breakthrough infections and reports of waning immunity lack important context and data on who is seriously affected and why. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include: 94.7% of all COVID-19 cases in Canada since December 14 have been among those not fully vaccinated, as well as 95.8% of hospitalizations and 94.3% of deaths. Fully vaccinated Canadians who do get COVID-19 are 79% less likely to be hospitalized and 64% less likely to die. Older, frailer Canadians living with comorbidities in congregate settings, such as long-term care facilities, are at increased risk of breakthrough infections. A recent preprint study found much lower levels of neutralizing antibodies in elderly patients in Ontario long-term care residents. New data from researchers at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) in Toronto found fully vaccinated people over 16 in Ontario were highly protected against both infection and severe COVID-19 after eight months. These points suggest that forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada should take into account vaccination rates, age, underlying health conditions, and comorbidities, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe outcomes.
