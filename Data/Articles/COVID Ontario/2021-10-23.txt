Title: Coronavirus Second Wave, Third Wave and Beyond: What Causes a COVID Surge
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: True

Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by waves of surges in new cases followed by declines. Several factors influence these COVID-19 waves, including vaccine effectiveness, human behavior, infection prevention policies, virus mutations, and the number of vulnerable individuals without immunity. COVID-19 surges occur when there is a spike in new cases, often due to a combination of factors such as holiday gatherings, variants, and relaxed infection prevention measures. The delta variant, which is highly contagious, has caused a significant surge in cases and hospitalizations. There is a delay between policy changes or variant emergence and their impact on COVID-19 data. An increase in cases or hospitalizations may not be evident for several weeks due to factors such as incubation period and reporting delays. To forecast and prepare for potential COVID-19 surges, it is important to monitor factors such as vaccination rates, mask adherence, indoor gatherings, and the presence of high-risk settings. Additionally, tracking coronavirus variants and their transmissibility can help anticipate surges. Hospitals and healthcare providers are stocking up on equipment and maintaining protective policies in anticipation of possible future surges. Recommendations for individuals include getting vaccinated, following COVID-19 precautions, monitoring local transmission rates, ensuring access to essential supplies, and staying up to date with vaccines, including the flu shot. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations can be challenging due to various factors, but considering the impact of variants, vaccination rates, and adherence to preventive measures can provide valuable insights.

Title: Tracking covid-19 excess deaths across countries
Publisher: The Economist
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the limitations of relying solely on official COVID-19 death tolls to understand the true impact of the pandemic, as these numbers may exclude those who did not test positive before dying and can be delayed due to processing times for death certificates. To address this, the article proposes using "excess deaths" as a simpler measure, which compares the total number of deaths from all causes in a given region during the pandemic to a historical baseline. By analyzing excess death data from various sources, the article finds that the COVID-19 death toll may be significantly higher than officially reported in many countries. For example, Russia recorded about 580,000 more deaths than expected between April 2020 and June 2021, while the official COVID-19 toll was only 130,000. In some developing countries, such as South Africa, excess death data reveal grim pictures with multiple large spikes in fatalities. The article also includes charts that compare excess deaths and official COVID-19 deaths over time for different countries and regions. These charts show that while some countries, such as the United States, experienced a rapid vaccination campaign and subsequent decline in excess mortality, others like Russia and South Africa continue to struggle with high death tolls. To estimate excess deaths in places without national mortality data, statistical models have been used, revealing alarming numbers. For instance, in India, it is estimated that 2.3 million people may have died from COVID-19 by May 2021, compared to the official count of about 200,000. Overall, the article highlights the value of excess death data in understanding the true impact of the pandemic and identifies regions with concerning trends that could indicate future COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: How cultural differences shape responses to COVID-19
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, along with some key facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: An international study on knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 found cultural differences with significant implications for public health strategies. People in Europe had the least knowledge of COVID-19 and were least concerned, while Americans were least likely to follow public health restrictions. Those in the Middle East and Asia were more aware and fearful of the virus. Interestingly, knowledge wasn't linked to fear, and gender differences in COVID-19 knowledge varied by region. The high death toll in the US and Europe suggests better advance awareness could have reduced the impact. The researchers recommend cultural and regional considerations in public health campaigns to improve knowledge, reduce fear, and encourage safe practices. Key Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Low knowledge and concern about COVID-19 in Europe and the US could impact hospitalization rates as these regions may have a higher proportion of unvaccinated or less cautious individuals. The high fear levels in the Middle East may lead to stricter adherence to public health measures, potentially lowering hospitalization rates. Gender dynamics play a role in COVID-19 knowledge, with females more knowledgeable overall but varying by region (e.g., males more knowledgeable in North America). This could influence hospitalization rates depending on regional gender ratios and health-seeking behaviors. Mask-wearing rates were significantly lower in Europe (35.5%) and North America, which could be a predictor of higher hospitalization rates compared to other regions with higher mask adherence. These cultural and regional differences can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying potential hotspots or regions that may be more successful in controlling the spread.

Title: The benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID-19
Publisher: Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect oneself and others from the virus. Vaccination is especially important as it trains the immune system to recognize and fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. By getting vaccinated, individuals can reduce their risk of infection and severe illness, and contribute to herd immunity, which protects the wider community. To be fully vaccinated, individuals should receive two doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccines in Canada, with the exception of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, which requires only one dose. Completing the vaccine series provides maximum protection against the virus, including variants of concern. While vaccination significantly reduces the risk of infection, it is not 100% effective. Therefore, individuals should continue following good practices such as frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home if feeling unwell, even after being fully vaccinated. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, vaccination rates are a crucial factor. Higher vaccination coverage generally leads to lower hospitalization rates as vaccines help prevent severe illness. However, other factors such as the prevalence of new variants, the time since vaccination, and the age and health status of the population also influence hospitalization forecasts.

Title: COVID-19 ER visits and hospitalizations on the rise among Alberta kids
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
A Calgary doctor reports that the emergency room at Alberta Children's Hospital is treating more children for COVID-19 than during any other wave. COVID-19 rates among fiveto 11-year-olds, who are unvaccinated, surged in September, leading to a corresponding increase in ER visits and hospitalizations. The pediatric emergency room physician at Alberta Children's Hospital reports that they are seeing between two and five COVID-positive children per day, with some requiring admission and intensive care. As of Tuesday, 16 out of 1,053 people hospitalized for COVID-19 were under 18, including four children in intensive care. COVID-19 hospitalizations among children in Alberta have increased by 24.5% since September 1, with a 23% jump in ICU admissions. While children currently account for only 1.5% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, health care providers are concerned about a potential spike in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition that can occur weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Alberta Health reports that 48 children have been hospitalized for MIS-C, including 21 in the ICU, since tracking began in May 2020. The province's chief medical officer of health reported the death of a 14-year-old boy with complex pre-existing medical conditions due to COVID-19, drawing criticism for noting these conditions during the announcement. However, it was later retracted and apologized for by the province, as the boy's death was wrongly attributed to COVID-19. The surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among children, along with the potential for MIS-C, has put pressure on hospitals already dealing with a resurgence of other viral illnesses.

Title: Religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccine mandate: Here’s what we know, what we don’t - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the upcoming federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Canada and the potential for religious exemptions. It is noted that while medical exemptions are typically clear-cut, the lines are blurrier when it comes to religious exemptions. The article then explores what religious exemptions are and which religions may exempt followers from getting vaccinated. It is mentioned that only a handful of religions explicitly ban vaccinations, and none of them have a significant following in Canada. Experts weigh in on the topic, with one pointing out that anyone can invoke religion as an excuse, but it is important to consider whether religious leaders support the exemption claim. The government is also justified in imposing vaccine mandates and accommodating religious exemptions within a liberal democracy. Finally, it is predicted that the majority of people claiming religious exemptions may not be sincere in their objections.
