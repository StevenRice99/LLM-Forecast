Title: Moderna is banking on a combined COVID, flu and RSV vaccine. Will it work?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Moderna Therapeutics' stock price dropped by 30% in January due to weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a decline in COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The company's CEO, Stéphane Bancel, has reportedly cashed out over $165 million in stock options.
According to recent data, fewer than one in five Canadians have received a COVID-19 booster or completed an initial vaccine series in the last six months. However, more than 84% of Canadian children aged five and older have received at least two doses. The low uptake of boosters is concerning, as it leaves many people vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19.
Moderna is working on a new vaccine that combines protection against COVID-19, flu, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). The company aims to offer a single shot annually to protect against these three viruses. However, experts have raised concerns about the complexity of developing such a vaccine and its potential effectiveness.
RSV is a significant concern for vulnerable populations, such as infants and the elderly, who can experience severe disease from the virus. Developing an RSV vaccine has been challenging in the past, with two infants dying in the 1960s after experiencing severe lung inflammation following vaccination.
Experts have cautioned that combining multiple targets into one vaccine requires careful consideration of safety, efficacy, and dosing. The mRNA vaccine technology used by Moderna has shown promise against COVID-19 but will need to be proven effective for other viruses as well.
The development of an RSV vaccine is crucial for vulnerable populations, and experts are monitoring the situation closely. However, it's essential to prioritize data-driven decision-making and ensure that any new vaccines meet strict safety and efficacy standards before they become widely available.
