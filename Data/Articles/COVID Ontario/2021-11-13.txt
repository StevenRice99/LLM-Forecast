The article discusses the sale of a long-term care home in Mississauga, Ontario, that experienced one of the most severe COVID-19 outbreaks during the first wave of the pandemic. Camilla Care Community, owned by Sienna Senior Living, is in the process of being sold to a not-for-profit organization and a hospital network, Trillium Health Partners (THP). The move is seen as a positive step, particularly given the home's history of COVID-19 deaths and the broader issues of for-profit long-term care in Ontario. The sale, if approved, is expected to be finalized in March and will result in no disruption to resident care. As for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article provides some context on the impact of the virus in long-term care homes in Ontario during the first wave. Camilla Care Community recorded 68 deaths, one of the highest death tolls in the province. In total, over 3,700 long-term care residents died of COVID-19 in Ontario in 2020. These numbers highlight the vulnerability of this population and the potential for rapid spread and severe outcomes in congregate care settings.

Title: Canadians want home care, not long-term care facilities, after COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the challenging living conditions and management of nursing homes in Canada, with a significant number of deaths occurring in these residences during the first wave. A survey of individuals between 50 and 69 years old in Ontario and Quebec revealed that the pandemic has significantly shifted perceptions and preferences regarding long-term care. Key findings from the survey include: 72% of respondents are less inclined to consider entering a nursing home. 70% are concerned about health risks in long-term care facilities. 25% plan to save more for old age to avoid nursing homes and prefer home care. 70% support tax policies subsidizing home care. The article highlights the global population aging trend and the increasing need for long-term care solutions. The pandemic has prompted a reevaluation of nursing home care, with a growing preference for home care, which is typically more expensive. However, home care is not always an option for those without family support, making public long-term care homes the only choice. To address these challenges, the article calls for policy interventions, including improved long-term care standards, safer infrastructure, better staffing, and training for care workers. Additionally, there is a need to make home care more financially accessible through subsidies and tax exemptions to align with the preferences of aging Canadians. These measures are crucial to ensuring the well-being and safety of the elderly population, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 uses sugars to invade human cells, new study shows
Publisher: University of Alberta
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
A University of Alberta-led study has found that sugars on the surface of human cells, called glycans, influence COVID-19 infection. These glycans are made of sialic acid and biomolecules essential for cell structure and function. The study found that the COVID-19 virus uses these glycans to gain access to and infect cells, a process known as "viral entry." This discovery provides valuable insight into the virus's infection process and suggests that cells in the brain, which have a high concentration of certain glycans, may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. The study used mass spectrometry and biological tools to investigate the interaction between the viral spike protein and host-cell glycans. Researchers found that blocking sugar production on cell receptors reduced the virus's ability to infect cells by up to 10 times. This knowledge can help monitor for concerning variants that may evolve to become more sugar-dependent for infection. The study also connects to research on blood type susceptibility, as people with blood type A are more prone to severe COVID-19 infections, potentially due to sugar binding properties. While this understanding doesn't immediately lead to a therapy, it helps anticipate future viral variants and informs ongoing research into COVID-19 hospitalizations and severity.

Title: Global progress against measles threatened amidst COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article highlights the decline in reported measles cases globally in 2020 compared to previous years, but also warns that progress toward measles elimination is slowing and the risk of outbreaks remains high. Here are the key points to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: More than 22 million infants missed their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2020, a significant increase from 2019, creating conditions conducive to outbreaks. Measles surveillance has deteriorated, with the lowest number of laboratory tests in over a decade, making it challenging to accurately track the disease. Major measles outbreaks occurred in 26 countries in 2020, accounting for 84% of all reported cases. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted immunization services and health-seeking behaviors, and the focus on COVID-19 response may have diverted resources from measles detection and diagnostics. The ability of countries to ensure children receive both doses of the measles vaccine is a key indicator of progress toward measles elimination and controlling the spread of the virus. However, coverage for both doses fell in 2020, leaving communities vulnerable. Postponement of 24 measles vaccination campaigns in 23 countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic left over 93 million people at risk of contracting measles. The measures used to mitigate COVID-19, such as masking and social distancing, also help reduce measles transmission. However, prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination should not come at the cost of essential immunization programs for other diseases. Estimated measles deaths dropped significantly from 2000 to 2020, but the estimated number of measles cases in 2020 was still high at 7.5 million globally. Measles transmission within communities indicates poor vaccination coverage and is a marker of health services not reaching the most at-risk populations. By the end of 2020, 81 countries (42%) maintained their measles elimination status, but no new countries achieved elimination. Partners in the Measles & Rubella Initiative emphasize the urgent need to address immunity gaps, strengthen routine immunization, and conduct targeted catch-up campaigns to prevent deadly measles outbreaks. In summary, while reported measles cases have decreased, the risk of outbreaks remains high due to declining vaccination rates, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and weaknesses in surveillance and health systems. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is crucial to consider the potential impact of these factors, including the diversion of resources towards COVID-19 response, disruptions to routine immunization services, and the vulnerability of communities with low vaccination coverage.

Title: Lessons from COVID-19 for the next pandemic: We need better data on workplace transmission
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article highlights the failure of public health agencies to collect data on the role of workplaces in the spread of COVID-19. The authors argue that collecting information about the work of those infected with COVID-19 was minimal and inconsistent, which hindered the understanding of the virus's transmission and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. They suggest that by collecting data on work settings and potential transmission routes, it would have been possible to identify workplace settings where COVID-19 spread was occurring and allow more people to continue working safely. To improve future pandemic responses, the authors propose three recommendations: 1. Routinely collect information about work in public health databases, including occupation, industry, and workplace details, to understand the impact of work on health outcomes. 2. Consider workplace exposures as part of a continuum of exposures, intersecting with other determinants of health such as commute, housing, and community. 3. Strengthen connections between public health and occupational health agencies to recognize the importance of work in health outcomes and collaborate on prevention measures. The authors emphasize that better data on the relationship between work and COVID-19 infections is crucial for developing targeted prevention strategies and improving public health responses to future pandemics.

Title: Emission Reductions From Pandemic Had Unexpected Effects on Atmosphere
Publisher: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the unexpected outcome of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a significant drop in emissions due to reduced human activity, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere continued to grow at a similar rate as previous years. This was attributed to natural variations and the ocean absorbing less CO2. The pandemic also led to a decrease in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, which had a complex impact on the atmosphere. While it resulted in a global reduction in ozone levels, it also limited the atmosphere's ability to break down methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane concentrations increased during the pandemic, contributing to climate change. The article highlights the complexity of atmospheric chemistry and the need for a transition to low-carbon-emitting technology to achieve long-term emissions reduction. Regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide direct information. However, the discussion on nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone is relevant. NOx emissions can lead to the formation of ozone, which is harmful to human health. Reductions in NOx emissions during the pandemic may have had a positive impact on air quality and potentially respiratory health, which could indirectly affect COVID-19 hospitalization rates. However, further data and research would be needed to establish a direct connection.

Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic on journeypersons in Canada and how they were affected by the pandemic's economic shutdown and the implementation of COVID-19-related health measures. The study specifically looks at the proportion of journeypersons who received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), a temporary benefit introduced by the Government of Canada to support those facing job losses and income reductions due to the pandemic. Key findings from the article include: Over one-third (38%) of journeypersons who certified between 2008 and 2019 received the CERB during the 28 weeks it was available. This proportion is slightly higher than that of the general working population, where about one-third received the benefit. Female journeypersons were more likely to receive the CERB than their male counterparts, with over half (56%) of certified female journeypersons receiving the benefit compared to just over one-third (36%) of male journeypersons. Female journeypersons also received the benefit for a longer duration (17 weeks) than male journeypersons (13 weeks). Journeypersons in trades related to industries disproportionately impacted by the closure of non-essential businesses, such as food and accommodation and personal care services, had the highest proportion of CERB recipients. These trades include hairstylists and early childhood educators, which also account for a significant number of female journeypersons. Geographic variations were observed, with journeypersons in Quebec and Ontario having higher proportions of CERB recipients than in other provinces. The percentage of female journeypersons receiving the benefit was highest in Manitoba and Ontario. Visible minorities among journeypersons were disproportionately affected, with close to half of Black, Chinese, Latin American, and South Asian journeypersons receiving the CERB. These groups also received the benefit for a longer duration than non-visible minorities. The percentage of journeypersons receiving the CERB varied across population groups and trades. For example, among male steamfitters/pipefitters, Black, South Asian, Filipino, and Latin American journeypersons had a higher proportion of CERB take-up compared to their non-visible minority counterparts. The article concludes by highlighting the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on certain groups, including women, visible minorities, and those in public-facing industries. As provinces continue to reopen their economies, it will be crucial to monitor the labour market conditions faced by journeypersons and continuing apprentices. This study provides insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected different groups of journeypersons in Canada and offers valuable information for policymakers and stakeholders in the skilled trades industry to address the challenges faced by these groups.

Title: COVID-19: The older you are, the more antibodies you have
Publisher: Université de Montréal
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the Université de Montréal studied antibody levels and protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants in individuals who were naturally infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated. They found that both natural infection and vaccination led to the production of antibodies, but the Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines resulted in significantly higher antibody levels that were also effective against the Delta variant. The study specifically focused on 32 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive Canadian adults, and it was found that older individuals (over 50) produced more antibodies than those under 50. Antibodies produced after infection by the original strain of the virus also reacted to subsequent variants (Beta, Delta, and Gamma) but with a reduced effectiveness of 30-50%. Interestingly, antibodies from individuals 50 and older who were naturally infected provided better protection against the Delta variant compared to adults below 50. Vaccination in individuals with a history of mild COVID-19 doubled the antibody levels and improved their ability to prevent infection. The researchers suggest that further studies are needed to determine the best approach to maintaining effective antibody levels against all variants. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, some important facts to consider include: Older individuals (over 50) who recover from mild cases of COVID-19 tend to have higher antibody levels, which may provide some level of protection against subsequent infection and severe disease. Natural infection may not always lead to the production of antibodies that can inhibit the interaction of the virus with human cells, especially with certain variants like Delta. Vaccination, even in those previously infected, can boost antibody levels and enhance protection against variants. This could potentially reduce the number of hospitalizations by decreasing the severity of the disease. Understanding the dynamics of antibody production and protection across different age groups and in response to various variants can help inform public health strategies to manage the pandemic and forecast hospitalizations more accurately.

Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses a webinar that focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of infants, children, and parents, based on a policy brief by the Canadian Paediatric Society. The panel includes a parent with personal experience and a developmental pediatrician, who share their insights on the pandemic's effects and how to implement the policy brief recommendations. Here's a summary: Webinar Summary: The webinar is based on a policy brief by the Canadian Paediatric Society discussing the pandemic's impact on early childhood and parental mental health. The panel includes a parent with lived experience and a developmental pediatrician, offering firsthand insights and expertise. The discussion centers around the mental health of infants, children, and parents during the pandemic, exploring the challenges and long-term effects. The panel also focuses on the policy brief's recommendations, providing guidance on how to improve early childhood and parental mental health programs and policies. Key Points and Facts: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant negative effects on the mental health of infants, children, and parents, with disruptions to daily routines, limited social interactions, and increased stress and anxiety. Social isolation and reduced access to health and social services have further impacted parental mental health and child development. The policy brief recommends improving access to virtual and in-person mental health services for parents and children, providing more support for parents, and increasing funding for early childhood education and care services. Implementing these recommendations can help mitigate the pandemic's short-term and long-term mental health impacts on families. Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: The mental health consequences of the pandemic may contribute to an increased need for pediatric health services, including hospitalizations, particularly for children with pre-existing mental health conditions or those who have experienced trauma. The disruption to routine healthcare and delays in diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic could also lead to a backlog of cases requiring hospitalization. However, it is challenging to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations directly related to mental health issues as they are often interconnected with other health conditions and factors. The webinar aims to raise awareness, inform policy changes, and improve support for families affected by the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 spreads through the air. Here's what you can do about it this winter
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Canada's public health guidance on reducing the risk of COVID-19 indoors has been criticized for not keeping up with the evolving science, particularly regarding aerosol transmission and masking recommendations. Experts suggest that the virus spreads primarily through microscopic airborne particles (aerosols) that can linger in the air, in addition to larger respiratory droplets. However, Canada's guidelines still emphasize physical distancing as the best way to prevent spread, which contradicts the understanding of aerosol transmission. Linsey Marr, a virus transmission expert, recommends that Canadians upgrade their masks to surgical masks or N95s, which offer better protection due to their higher filtration levels. Canada has not promoted the use of these masks for the general public as some other countries have. Mario Possamai, a senior adviser on the 2007 SARS Commission, criticizes Canada's public health leaders for their failure to implement simple and cost-effective airborne protective measures, which he believes has led to unnecessary deaths and infections. Experts suggest that a combination of measures, such as proper masking, ventilation, filtration, and high vaccination rates, will significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19 indoors during the winter months. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of tying decisions about lifting public health measures to data on transmission levels, rather than predetermined timelines. By taking these precautions and being patient, Canadians can effectively reduce their risk of COVID-19 and prevent future resurgences.
