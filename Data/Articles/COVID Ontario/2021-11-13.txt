Title: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Children Aged 5–11 Years — United States, November 2021
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has made an interim recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 5–11 years, considering the balance of benefits and risks. The key points from this text are:
Recommendation: 
Children aged 5–11 years should be vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
This recommendation is based on an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the vaccine in this age group.
Benefits of Vaccination: 
Reduced risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19
Protection against long-term complications of COVID-19, such as MIS-C and post-COVID sequelae
Enhanced protection against reinfection
Risks of Vaccination: 
Rare adverse event of myocarditis (heart inflammation) reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in some individuals, but none reported in clinical trials for children aged 5–11 years.
Key Considerations: 
Parents or guardians should be educated on the different formulation, dose, and volume of vaccine for use in this population to avoid errors.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine must be administered according to applicable state and territorial vaccination laws.
Demographic groups that have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, such as racial and ethnic minority groups, should be given consideration for access to vaccines.
Implementation: 
To expand access to COVID-19 vaccines in children aged 5–11 years, pediatric healthcare providers, pharmacies, schools, community leaders, and parents or guardians must work together.
Rapid and equitable access to vaccines will necessitate increasing enrollment of pediatric health care providers into the COVID-19 vaccination program.
Future Updates: 
ACIP will continue to review additional data as they become available.
Updates to recommendations or clinical considerations will be posted on the ACIP website.
