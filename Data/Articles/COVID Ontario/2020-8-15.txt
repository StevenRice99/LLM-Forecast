The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Current case load in Ottawa is relatively low, with 11 new cases and 118 active cases.

About a quarter of families plan to keep their children at home for online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the potential for outbreaks in schools. Dr. Deonandan emphasizes the importance of driving the case load in the community as low as possible to keep schools safe. He also highlights the need for measures such as more distancing in classrooms, smaller class sizes, better ventilation and filtration systems, and protocols for opening windows and outdoor classes to further protect students and teachers. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as they provide insight into the current state of the pandemic, the potential risks associated with reopening schools, and the measures that can be taken to mitigate those risks.
