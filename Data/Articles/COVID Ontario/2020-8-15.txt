Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Canada's Public Health Agency has released new modeling that predicts a significant spike in COVID-19 cases this fall if testing, contact tracing, and personal protection measures are not improved as schools and businesses reopen. The country's top doctors are preparing for a worst-case scenario, known as the "fall peak," which could overwhelm the public healthcare system. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam and Deputy Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo presented the new modeling, which suggests that the number of cases could be several times worse than what Canada has experienced so far. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is aiming for a "slow burn" scenario to minimize the impact on the healthcare system but is also planning for the worst-case scenario. Dr. Tam noted that the surge in cases will coincide with the flu season, putting additional strain on hospitals. While she did not provide a specific figure for the expected caseload, she advised health authorities to prepare for a significant increase. The number of new cases has already been increasing, with the highest infection rate among those aged 20-39. To limit outbreaks, Tam stressed the importance of detecting and isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantining, physical distancing, handwashing, staying home when possible, and using exposure notification apps. PHAC predicts that the case load could grow to between 121,650 and 127,740 by August 23, with the majority of cases in Ontario and Quebec. The Canadian government is preparing for a potential second wave, ensuring a supply of PPE and medical supplies, and working on vaccine administration. Today's modeling provides a snapshot of potential scenarios and projects that the "peaks and valleys" of COVID-19 could continue through 2022.

Title: 'Hundreds dead' because of Covid-19 misinformation
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, have been utilized to spread misinformation about COVID-19, leading to severe consequences. According to a study in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, approximately 800 deaths and 5,800 hospitalizations worldwide occurred due to coronavirus-related misinformation in the initial three months of 2020. Many individuals followed false advice, such as consuming methanol, cleaning products, or unconventional remedies, believing them to be cures or prevention methods for COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) termed this phenomenon an "infodemic," emphasizing the rapid spread of misinformation and its detrimental impact on public health. The responsibility to combat this infodemic lies with international agencies, governments, and social media platforms, but their responses have been criticized as slow and inadequate. Misinformation has led to social unrest, including mob attacks, arson, and assaults, as well as scams exploiting people's fears about the pandemic. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, there is a concern that anti-vaccine campaigners will leverage social media to discourage people from getting vaccinated. Despite efforts by social media companies to address misleading information, a significant portion of the population still believes in conspiracy theories related to vaccines. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is crucial to address and mitigate the impact of misinformation. The following key points could be considered: Monitoring and addressing misinformation: Social media platforms, international agencies, and governments should continue to monitor and address COVID-19 misinformation proactively. This includes removing or flagging false information and promoting credible sources and scientific consensus. Public education and media literacy: Investing in public education campaigns to enhance media literacy can help individuals identify misleading or false information. Encouraging critical thinking and verifying information from trusted sources can reduce the impact of misinformation on public health decisions. Rapid response to emerging misinformation: Being vigilant and responsive to emerging trends in misinformation is essential. Fact-checking organizations and public health authorities should promptly address new conspiracy theories or false cures to prevent their spread and potential impact on hospitalizations. Collaboration between healthcare providers and community leaders: Healthcare providers and community leaders can work together to disseminate accurate information and build trust within their communities. This can help counter misinformation and encourage individuals to seek appropriate medical care when needed. Addressing vaccine hesitancy: As vaccines become available, addressing vaccine hesitancy and providing clear, accurate information about their safety and effectiveness will be crucial in ensuring widespread vaccination and reducing hospitalizations. By incorporating these strategies and prioritizing the fight against misinformation, public health officials and governments can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and ultimately save lives.

Title: COVID-19: The 4 building blocks of the Great Reset
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the World Economic Forum's Great Reset initiative, which aims to use the COVID-19 pandemic as a catalyst for transforming the way our societies are run. The article proposes four building blocks for this transformation: 1. Mindset: The article argues that our current outlook is based on wrong assumptions and that a change in mindset can lead to dramatic transformation. It highlights the work of Thomas Piketty and Rutger Bregman, who challenge assumptions about inequality and human nature, respectively. 2. Metrics: The article critiques Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of progress, arguing that it fails to account for the distribution of wealth and the human and environmental costs of capitalism. It calls for new metrics that focus on the well-being of people and the planet. 3. Incentives: The article argues that incentives need to be redesigned to align with the goal of a more inclusive and sustainable economy. It critiques the dominance of shareholder value as the primary indicator of company success and calls for incentives that prioritize social and environmental impact. 4. Connection: The article highlights the importance of genuine connection between leaders and people, and among people. It argues that digital technologies can create an illusion of connection and that anonymity can fuel polarization and detachment from the consequences of our actions. It calls for deeper, more meaningful connections with each other and the natural world. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered, including vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, social distancing measures, and the availability of medical resources. The connection between leaders and the people, as mentioned in the article, can also play a role in encouraging responsible behavior and providing access to healthcare services.

Title: Commuting to work during COVID-19
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Due to COVID-19 restrictions, there has been a significant decrease in the number of commuters, which has led to a decline in ridership on public transportation and traffic congestion in major Canadian cities. Statistics Canada's Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) examined how Canadians' commuting habits changed during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, most commuters used personal motor vehicles (75%), followed by public transit (13%) and active transportation (7%). However, in June 2020, 22% of Canadians worked from home, a sharp increase from the pre-pandemic figure of 4%. As a result, there was a decline in the use of public transit and personal motor vehicles. The majority of those who switched from using a personal motor vehicle or active transportation before the pandemic continued using the same mode of transportation in June. However, there was a significant shift away from public transit, with only 24% of pre-pandemic public transit users still using it in June. About one-third switched to another mode of transportation, and 42% started teleworking. Workers in larger census metropolitan areas (CMAs) were more likely to switch to telework, as were those with higher levels of education. Immigrants were also more likely to switch to telework, possibly due to their higher likelihood of living in larger CMAs and having university degrees. The majority of public transit users before the pandemic expressed concerns about using it again, even if they felt safe returning to their physical workplace. This suggests that the shift away from public transit may continue even as the pandemic subsides. The article also mentions that Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and that the 2021 Census will provide valuable data to evaluate the long-term effects on commuting patterns in Canada. Overall, the article highlights the significant changes in commuting habits during the pandemic and provides insights into the factors influencing those changes. The decrease in public transit usage and increase in telework may have lasting impacts on urban transportation and work cultures. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, and the relaxation or tightening of public health measures. Additionally, the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators, as well as the capacity of the healthcare system to handle a surge in cases, are crucial factors in determining the hospitalization rate.

Title: COVID-19: Financial future grim for Canadians with disabilities, health conditions
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadians with disabilities and chronic health conditions. The authors conducted a nationwide survey that revealed that these individuals are concerned about their health and feel that their voices are not being heard by policymakers. One of the main concerns raised in the survey is the financial strain that the pandemic has caused. Many people with disabilities and health conditions do not qualify for COVID-19 benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), even though they may be out of work or facing reduced hours. This has led to increased credit card debt and difficulty paying for essentials like rent, utilities, and groceries. The survey also found that the pandemic is affecting respondents' ability to prepare for future financial emergencies, with two-thirds struggling to save money and many dipping into their savings. The article argues that even with relatively generous social and economic supports in Canada compared to other countries, vulnerable people are still being left out. The authors cite the example of a proposed one-time $600 payment to people with disabilities, which may be too little too late to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on this group. People with disabilities already face challenges such as low employment, low earnings, and poverty, and the added financial setbacks during the pandemic could further marginalize them as the country moves towards recovery. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact on vulnerable groups such as those with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Their increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, combined with the financial strain and limited access to support, may result in a higher likelihood of hospitalization.
