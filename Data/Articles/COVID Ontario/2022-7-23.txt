Article 2 of 3
Title: You'll likely catch COVID-19 again and again. Will each round feel milder?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses how frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to improved immunity, but with some caveats. Experts agree that while repeat infections may feel milder for most healthy individuals, it's essential to consider shifting risk factors for severe disease.
Some key points from the article include:
The immune system adapts and learns from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, leading to improved immunity over time.
Getting vaccinated is an alternative to direct exposure, allowing the body to learn about the virus without risking infection.
If you're vaccinated and catch COVID-19, your immune system can still control the infection quickly, reducing its impact.
Not every reinfection will be "benign," particularly in higher-risk populations such as older adults or those with underlying health conditions.
Repeat infections may lead to poorer outcomes, including lung damage, long COVID symptoms, and secondary infections.

Title: What a 4th COVID shot can do for you — and what it can't
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False

The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 vaccination efforts, particularly regarding the need for third and fourth doses. Here are the key points:
1. Third dose still important: Experts emphasize the importance of getting a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, as it provides significant protection against severe disease and infection with Omicron BA.1.
2. Fourth dose benefits unclear: While some people may benefit from a fourth dose, particularly those who are older or have compromised immune systems, the benefits for younger age groups are less clear.
3. BA.5 variant spreading: The emergence of the highly contagious BA.4 and BA.5 variants has sparked concern, and experts worry that current vaccines may not provide sufficient protection against these new strains.
4. Updated bivalent vaccines on the horizon: Moderna's bivalent vaccine is one example of a new type of vaccine that combines protection against the original virus with Omicron. However, experts are cautious about its effectiveness against newer variants like BA.2.12.1 and BA.5.
5. Newer vaccine technologies in development: Innovative platforms with new targets or modes of delivery, such as intranasal boosters or pan-coronavirus vaccines, may offer more robust immune responses and could be available soon.
6. Public messaging needs to change: Experts stress the need for a different approach to public messaging around COVID-19 vaccination, emphasizing that while vaccines can provide some protection against severe disease, they are not a guarantee against transmission.
Overall, the article highlights the complexities of the current pandemic situation and the evolving nature of COVID-19 variants. While third and fourth doses may still be beneficial, experts emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated with the most up-to-date information available and being prepared for new vaccine technologies to emerge in the future.
