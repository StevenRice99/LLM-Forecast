Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This article provides an overview of the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidance for public health surveillance of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The goal of surveillance is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mitigate the impact of the disease. WHO recommends maintaining and strengthening surveillance to achieve core objectives, such as early warning of epidemiological changes and monitoring disease trends and its impact on healthcare capacity. The guidance includes updated case and contact definitions, priority groups, and settings, as well as enhanced surveillance methods and the integration of genomic surveillance. Importantly, the reporting requirements to WHO have been updated to include new ICU admissions for COVID-19 treatment, highlighting the ongoing need for global surveillance data to inform public health decisions.

Title: Vitamin D for COVID-19: where are we now?
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
It was believed that vitamin D could reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 due to its effects on other respiratory viruses and the prevention of acute respiratory infections. While effective vaccines and drugs have been developed, reports suggest a link between low vitamin D levels and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D induces antiviral mechanisms and regulates inflammation in response to certain viruses. It may play a role in regulating SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, but it is not essential for preventing severe outcomes. Observational studies associate low vitamin D levels with increased COVID-19 severity, but Mendelian randomization studies found no association. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) investigating vitamin D's therapeutic effects on COVID-19 have shown heterogeneous results. Some report null results, while others show favorable outcomes. However, well-conducted RCTs have not consistently demonstrated benefits of vitamin D on mortality, intensive care requirement, or hospital stay duration. Two RCTs on prophylactic vitamin D also showed contrasting results. A placebo-controlled RCT in Mexico found a strong protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while an open-label RCT in the UK showed no effect. The lack of consistent results from RCTs means there are no recommendations for using vitamin D prophylactically or therapeutically for COVID-19 in national or international guidelines.

Title: Measuring exposure and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to global value chains: An analysis based on imported specified intermediate goods in Canada
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global value chains (GVCs) and Canada's participation in them through an analysis of imported specified intermediate goods (SIGs). GVCs refer to the use of foreign value-added embodied in intermediate goods or tasks in production. The pandemic has highlighted the risks associated with interdependent global trade when supply sources are concentrated, leading to disruptions in GVCs. Canada's participation in import GVCs is measured as the share of imported SIGs in total imports. During the three years before the pandemic, SIGs represented about 26% of total Canadian imports. This ratio declined to 24.9% in 2020 and 23.5% in 2021, indicating a slowdown in import GVC activity during the pandemic. The value of imported SIGs in the production process decreased by 7.4% between 2019 and 2021, while the value of imported generic intermediate goods (GIGs) and consumption goods increased. Imports of SIGs were concentrated in three broad economic categories (BECs): transport equipment and travel services, construction/housing/appliances/furniture, and health/sports/cultural activities/education. The transport equipment and travel services BEC was negatively impacted by GVC disruptions during the pandemic. The article also analyzes Canada's exposure to imported SIGs from different countries. Exposure to the United States and Mexico decreased, while exposure to China increased. There were also shifts in supply chains within specific BECs, with some adjustments towards Asian countries and greater diversification within the region. The exposure measure is further analyzed for top imported products, revealing nuances in GVC participation. Overall exposure to imported SIGs from the US decreased, but there were increases for specific key products involved in GVCs, such as engines and electronic integrated circuits. In conclusion, the ratio of imported SIGs to total imports can be used as a measure of a country's participation in GVCs. Canada's ratio declined during the pandemic, indicating disruptions in GVCs. The article provides insights into how the pandemic has impacted Canada's trade and participation in global value chains. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, additional data on infection rates, vaccination rates, and the severity of the virus would be necessary. However, the article does provide insights into the economic impact of the pandemic and how it has disrupted global supply chains, which could indirectly affect hospitalization rates by influencing the availability of medical supplies and resources.

Title: Should you get your 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose now? Alberta experts weigh in
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the decision Albertans face regarding whether to get a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine now or wait for new vaccines that are in development. Some doctors and scientists suggest that individuals assess their risk factors and make a decision based on their personal circumstances. With COVID-19 transmission rising in Alberta and the highly transmissible BA.5 subvariant becoming dominant, Craig Jenne, an associate professor of microbiology, immunology, and infectious diseases, recommends that high-risk individuals and those engaging in high-risk activities such as travel should consider a second booster shot to ensure their immunity is as high as possible. However, the decision is more complex for otherwise healthy individuals, as new bivalent vaccines targeting earlier Omicron variants are expected to be available in the future. Dr. Stephanie Smith acknowledges the challenges in deciding between taking the fourth dose now or waiting for the new vaccine, especially since it is unclear how long individuals would have to wait after the fourth shot to be eligible for the bivalent vaccine. Smith emphasizes that the decision ultimately depends on the risk of severe disease for each individual. Dr. Noel Gibney agrees that with the surge in BA.5 cases, eligible Albertans should get their fourth doses to reduce the strain on hospitals. He doesn't think people should wait for the new vaccine, expected in December, as it may be too late to prevent another wave.

On July 19, 2022, Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken co-hosted the COVID-19 Global Action Plan Foreign Ministerial Meeting. The meeting emphasized the ongoing need for global countermeasures and coordination to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health crises. Minister Hayashi highlighted Japan's contributions to vaccine equity and its support for the GAP initiative, which facilitates information sharing and assistance coordination. He also announced seed-funding of 10 million USD to the FIF at the World Bank and intentions to strengthen international partnerships for better prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR), particularly in Africa. Secretary Blinken stressed the continued risk posed by new COVID-19 variants and called for sustained high-level attention on delivering concrete outcomes. He urged participants to improve coordination and equitable access to vaccines and treatments, including booster doses and pediatric vaccines. He also emphasized the importance of strengthening global health security architecture and addressing other ongoing health threats, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The meeting included participants from over 25 countries and international organizations, who reaffirmed their commitment to the COVID-19 Global Action Plan's six lines of effort: 1. Getting shots in arms 2. Bolstering supply chain resilience 3. Addressing information gaps 4. Supporting healthcare workers 5. Expanding access to testing and treatment 6. Strengthening global health security architecture Key takeaways include the recognition of remaining challenges and the need for continued global collaboration to address them, with a focus on vaccine distribution, supply chain resilience, information sharing, and strengthening healthcare systems to forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations more effectively.

Title: Responding to Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Needs During COVID-19 in Indigenous and Afro-Descendant Communities in the Americas
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health and well-being of individuals worldwide, with concerns about increased suicidal behavior and limited access to mental health services. Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations in the Americas have historically faced systemic inequalities, and the pandemic has further exacerbated these issues, leading to increased psychosocial vulnerability, especially in indigenous youth. A collaborative initiative between PAHO/WHO and PHAC aims to enhance mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) responses for these vulnerable communities. The pandemic's impact varies across countries, and coping mechanisms among Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations differ accordingly. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The impact of the pandemic on mental health and the resulting increase in psychosocial vulnerabilities, especially in indigenous communities, could potentially lead to higher hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and related complications. Limited access to essential healthcare services due to the pandemic may result in a higher risk of severe COVID-19 cases among these vulnerable populations, requiring hospitalization. Cultural and systemic barriers might hinder these communities from seeking timely medical attention, resulting in more advanced disease progression and the need for hospitalization. The mental health consequences of the pandemic might also indirectly influence hospitalization rates for other health conditions or complications.

Title: Caregivers were traumatized by COVID-19 public health and long-term care policies
Publisher: The Conversation Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
During the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term care (LTC) residents in Canada experienced high rates of COVID-19 deaths, with 81% of national reported deaths occurring in this population. The pandemic also brought to light the inhumane treatment and neglect that many LTC residents faced, including physical and social isolation, as well as lack of proper care and attention. In response, the Canadian military was deployed to some LTC homes, but family caregivers were still forbidden from visiting their loved ones. The article discusses the concept of collective trauma experienced by essential family caregivers, who felt extreme helplessness and hopelessness due to prolonged separation from their loved ones in LTC. The use of technology as a substitute for in-person visits was often inadequate and frustrating for both family members and residents. Additionally, family caregivers had to undergo frequent and invasive PCR testing to maintain access to their loved ones. As a result of the pandemic, family caregivers also witnessed the physical, cognitive, and psychological decline of their loved ones, which has caused additional trauma and distress. To prevent similar situations in the future, the article proposes policy changes, the adoption of trauma-informed care approaches, and the extension of counseling services to family caregivers. It also emphasizes the need for more publicly funded and quality home care models to allow older adults to age in place.

Title: You'll likely catch COVID-19 again and again. Will each round feel milder?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 reinfections are becoming more common as the virus evolves and finds ways to infect people repeatedly. While early in the pandemic, there was speculation about one-and-done infections providing immunity, that idea has been replaced by the understanding that coronaviruses can cause repeated infections. Scientists reassure that for healthy adults, especially those vaccinated, subsequent COVID-19 infections are likely to become milder as the immune system gains experience in fighting the virus. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections is unpredictable, unlike seasonal coronaviruses that tend to reinfect every 12 months. The evolution of contagious variants and increased social interaction contribute to the rise in reinfections. Experts predict that while reinfections may become more common, they are unlikely to result in worse symptoms or severe illness for most healthy individuals. However, it is important to consider changing risk factors over time. The elderly and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk of severe reinfections, which can lead to lung damage, long COVID symptoms, and serious secondary infections. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of reinfections and the vulnerability of specific populations. While reinfections may not always lead to hospitalization for healthy individuals, they can still contribute to overall healthcare burden and impact high-risk individuals disproportionately.
