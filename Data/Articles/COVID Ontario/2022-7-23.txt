Title: What a 4th COVID shot can do for you — and what it can't
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False

TRUE. This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the effectiveness of fourth doses of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, particularly in the context of the highly contagious BA.5 Omicron subvariant. Key points relevant to forecasting hospitalizations include: Research suggests that while a third dose offers significant protection against severe COVID-19, a fourth dose provides only marginal benefit against severe illness, even in vulnerable groups. The BA.5 subvariant has sparked an unexpectedly timed seventh wave across much of Canada, leading to a significant rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Data shows that protection against infection and severe COVID-19 from a fourth dose begins to wane after several weeks. Experts emphasize the importance of increasing uptake of third doses, which research suggests adds significant protection against severe COVID-19. The article also mentions the emergence of new subvariants, such as BA.2.75, which could potentially impact hospitalization rates. These points highlight the complexity of forecasting hospitalizations in the context of evolving COVID-19 variants and vaccine effectiveness.
