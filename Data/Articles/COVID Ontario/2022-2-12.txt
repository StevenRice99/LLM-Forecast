Title: Tip of the iceberg: erectile dysfunction and COVID-19
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures implemented to control its spread have significantly impacted people's mental health and well-being. The uncertainty, fear, and social isolation associated with the pandemic have contributed to increased psychological distress, worry, anxiety, and depression in individuals worldwide. This new reality, with sudden changes in daily routines and relationship dynamics, may have triggered underlying mental health issues and exacerbated existing ones. The pandemic has also affected interpersonal and intimate relationships, with concerns about safe intimate interactions, forced separation of partners, and increased marital conflicts contributing to sexual difficulties and dissatisfaction. While some evidence suggests a paradoxical increase in sexual desire and activity during the pandemic, most studies report negative effects on sexual functioning and satisfaction, particularly in men's erectile response, which is associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. The COVID-19 context has been proposed as a long-term stressor, triggering or exacerbating erectile problems in men due to the activation of psychological vulnerabilities and emotional distress. Personality traits like neuroticism and extraversion, along with dysfunctional sexual beliefs, play a role in the development and maintenance of male sexual problems. Cognitive interference during sexual situations can hinder the processing of sexual stimuli and compromise physiological and subjective sexual responses, leading to a decrease in sexual arousal and increased performance anxiety. Given the potential impact of the pandemic on sexual and mental health, awareness and support for these issues have become international public health priorities. Local and international institutions are providing resources and interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental and sexual well-being. Sexual activity and satisfaction may play a protective role in mental health during this time, highlighting the importance of specialized support interventions for sexual problems, particularly for ED, which may have long-term consequences for those infected with SARS-CoV-2. Effective clinical interventions for ED require an integrated, multidisciplinary approach combining biomedical and tailored psychological interventions to address patients' needs and circumstances.

Title: COVID-19 vaccine mandates have worked in Canada — but they're harder than ever to justify
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Canada and the need to consider mandating booster doses to combat the Omicron variant. Vaccine mandates have significantly increased vaccination rates in Canada, leading to high levels of protection and low death rates. However, experts now argue that two-dose mandates are no longer sufficient due to the reduced effectiveness against the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Research shows that a third dose significantly boosts protection against infection and severe illness. There is a debate on whether to expand vaccine mandates to include booster doses or abolish them altogether. The effectiveness of boosters may wane over time, as shown by data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The evolving nature of the virus, with new variants like Omicron, raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of current vaccines and the need for updated vaccines in the future. Experts emphasize the importance of tracking the virus as it mutates and caution against prematurely lifting mandates and restrictions. The unpredictability of future variants underscores the ongoing need for vigilance in managing the pandemic.

Title: Gazing into the COVID-19 crystal ball with Josée van den Hoogen, Defence Scientist
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) scientist, Josée van den Hoogen, has been contributing to COVID-19 modelling to estimate the prevalence of infections and inform decision-making within the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). van den Hoogen's work in operational research presents a unique challenge as COVID-19 is still a relatively new and evolving disease. The models she develops must continuously adapt to account for new information such as vaccination status and emerging variants. The DRDC team at the Centre for Operational Research and Analysis (CORA) has collaborated creatively during the pandemic to support Canadian Forces Health Services (CFHS). van den Hoogen's background in evolutionary medicine and mathematical epidemiology has been crucial in applying epidemiological models to COVID-19. The research helps forecast hospitalizations by informing CAF decision-makers responsible for deploying military members for operations and exercises.

Title: Use of Rapid Antigen Tests during the Omicron Wave
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The emergence of the Omicron variant has reduced the effectiveness of rapid antigen tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in the first 1-2 days after infection. The pooled sensitivity of rapid antigen tests for Omicron infections is only 37.1%, compared to 81.0% for Delta infections. The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests also varies depending on the commercial test used and the stage of disease progression. Combined oral-nasal sampling improves the sensitivity of rapid antigen tests for Omicron, with a sensitivity of 81.6% compared to 68.4% for nasal samples alone. However, even with combined sampling, a single negative rapid antigen test result cannot reliably rule out infection due to the high pre-test probability of disease during the Omicron wave. Conversely, a positive rapid test result should be considered as a confirmed case of COVID-19, and the individual should immediately isolate. When using asymptomatic testing strategies, such as 'Test-to-Stay' or 'Voluntary Asymptomatic Screen Testing', rapid antigen tests need to be performed frequently to be effective. This includes daily testing for asymptomatic close contacts and 3-5 times per week for asymptomatic individuals.

Title: Facts and falsehoods in the time of COVID-19
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the role of preprints, or scientific manuscripts that have not yet undergone peer review, in sharing information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While preprints can provide quick access to scientific findings and help keep the public informed, the authors caution that publishing unverified science also carries risks. The study found that media outlets, including prominent sources such as the New York Times, used preprints to report on COVID-19, but only about half mentioned that the research was unverified. The authors provide guidance for journalists covering preprints, including considering the implications of sharing unverified research and seeking outside opinions on the research. They also emphasize the importance of critical and reflexive science communication to check facts, question evidence, and investigate claims.

Title: A better post-pandemic future means not giving in to COVID-19 now
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the fatigue and resignation that people are feeling towards COVID-19 and its associated safety measures, such as masks and vaccines. It compares the idea of intentionally spreading COVID-19 to the historical practice of exposing healthy children to chickenpox, which often led to shingles later in life. The authors, who are researchers in molecular virology and viral immunology, emphasize the risks and unknown long-term consequences of COVID-19, even with the milder Omicron variant. They highlight the impact of the current wave on healthcare, businesses, and schools due to worker absences. The article stresses that vaccines have prevented countless deaths and severe illnesses during the Omicron wave. It also mentions the high prevalence of long COVID, with one in three patients experiencing physical and mental health symptoms. Additionally, there is emerging evidence of a link between COVID-19 and Type 1 diabetes in children. The authors argue that the pandemic has created an opportunity to improve public health practices, such as normalizing mask-wearing during infection peaks and maintaining better hand hygiene. They also highlight the benefits of working remotely and improved sick leave policies to protect vulnerable workers and prevent outbreaks from pulling down entire organizations. While COVID-19 has had devastating effects, the authors argue that the increased awareness of infection control and the adoption of effective tools can benefit us in the future. They emphasize that fatigue is not a reason to let the virus spread unchecked and that using proven tools can help accelerate a return to normalcy while protecting vulnerable communities.
