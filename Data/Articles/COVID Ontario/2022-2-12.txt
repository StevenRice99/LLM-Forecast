Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the importance of considering the vaccination status of hospitalized patients in the context of the overall population size and age. It notes that while the majority of COVID-19-related hospitalizations in some provinces, including Ontario, involve patients who are fully vaccinated, this is because the vaccinated population is much larger than the unvaccinated population. The article cites experts who emphasize the need to adjust for population size and age when interpreting hospitalization data. For example, Dr. Peter Juni, head of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, notes that the rate of COVID-19-related hospitalization among those with at least two vaccine doses is 124.9 per million, compared to 756.1 per million among unvaccinated people. The article also highlights the importance of considering age as a risk factor for COVID-19-related hospitalization. Dr. Juni notes that older adults are at greater risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, and that this is contributing to the high rates of vaccination among hospitalized patients. Key values mentioned in the article that are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include: 80-90% of the Canadian population is vaccinated with at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine 17 hospitalizations per one million people among fully vaccinated individuals in Quebec 39.5 hospitalizations per one million people among unvaccinated individuals in Quebec 124.9 per million rate of COVID-19-related hospitalization among those with at least two vaccine doses in Ontario 756.1 per million rate of COVID-19-related hospitalization among unvaccinated people in Ontario 14.7 million people living in Ontario These values can be used to inform forecasting models and estimate the potential number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

TRUE. The article discusses the shift in Canada's pandemic response towards "learning to live with the virus" and the potential lifting of public health restrictions in various provinces, including Ontario. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, mentioned in the article include: Record-high hospitalizations and ICU admissions in Ontario, which are only now beginning to show signs of declining nationally. Ontario's plan to lift most remaining public health measures by mid-March. The province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, stating that the coming weeks "will continue to be difficult" for the province's hospital system. The importance of monitoring the situation internationally, particularly in countries like Denmark and the U.K., which have recently lifted nearly all COVID-19 restrictions. The need for clear benchmarks for what level of COVID-19 is acceptable and whether alterations to the plan will be necessary. The concern that Ontario's vaccination rates are significantly lower than those in countries like Denmark and the U.K., which could impact hospitalizations. These points suggest that while there is a desire to return to normalcy, the situation in Ontario is still uncertain, and caution is needed when lifting public health restrictions to avoid a potential surge in hospitalizations.
