Title: Research doesn't back vaccine dose delay for seniors, Canada's chief science adviser says

TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Canada's chief science adviser, Dr. Mona Nemer, advises against extending the time between doses of COVID-19 vaccines to four months for seniors and those with pre-existing conditions, citing a lack of research to justify the delay. Studies have shown that extending the interval between doses has had a negative effect on vaccine efficacy, particularly in seniors. Preliminary research from the UK found that 95% of cancer patients produced an antibody response if they received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first, while only 43% showed the same response if they waited five weeks. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) may revisit its recommendation to extend the interval between doses, which could impact vaccine rollout and hospitalization rates in Ontario. Canada is expecting a large shipment of vaccines, which could also impact hospitalization rates. These points are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they relate to vaccine efficacy, dosage intervals, and vaccine supply, all of which can impact hospitalization rates.
