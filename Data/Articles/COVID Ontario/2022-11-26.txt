Title: The Most Influential Spreader of Coronavirus Misinformation Online
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article discusses a piece published online on February 9th that claimed COVID-19 vaccines were "a medical fraud." The article, which originated from Joseph Mercola, a 67-year-old osteopathic physician, asserted that the vaccines did not prevent infections or transmission and instead altered genetic coding. These claims were easily disproven, but that did not stop the article from being widely circulated and translated into multiple languages. It was picked up by anti-vaccination activists and spread to a large audience on Facebook. Dr. Mercola has a history of promoting unproven treatments and is now considered the chief spreader of coronavirus misinformation online. This example highlights the potential impact of misinformation on public health, particularly in terms of COVID-19 hospitalizations, as false claims about vaccine ineffectiveness may lead some individuals to forgo vaccination and increase their risk of severe illness.

Title: One year since the emergence of COVID-19 virus variant Omicron
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Omicron a new variant of concern, which altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Omicron was far more contagious than the previous Delta variant, and within four weeks, it had become the dominant strain worldwide. While it caused less severe illness than Delta on average, it still resulted in a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among unvaccinated individuals at risk of severe disease. By March 2022, an estimated 90% of the global population had antibodies against COVID-19, either through vaccination or infection. Omicron's high transmissibility overwhelmed healthcare systems, even in countries that had successfully managed the pandemic through public health measures. The emergence of Omicron subvariants has continued, with over 500 sublineages circulating, but none have been designated as new variants of concern. These subvariants share characteristics such as high transmissibility, replication in the upper respiratory tract, reduced disease severity, and increased ability to evade immunity. However, if a new variant arises that causes more severe disease or evades vaccine protection, the world's response will need to be reevaluated. WHO and the global scientific community are monitoring circulating variants to detect any signs of a new variant of concern. However, declining testing, sequencing, and surveillance, particularly at the human-animal interface, hinder these efforts. Quick detection and information sharing remain crucial to minimizing the impact of new variants on public health and our lives.

Title: Beijing in lockdown as China hits COVID-19 case record
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
China is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, with record-high daily infections reported on Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak in April when Shanghai was under lockdown. In response, the country has reinstated strict "zero-COVID" policies, including lockdowns, mass testing, and quarantines. The new restrictions have disrupted daily life in various cities, including Beijing, with shops, restaurants, malls, and residential compounds being sealed off. While the measures in Beijing are less severe than in other areas, the city's residents are still advised to stay at home unless necessary, and residential compounds vary in their restrictions on outside visitors and deliveries. The article also includes a series of images capturing the impact of the lockdown on Beijing, showing empty streets, closed shops, and workers in protective gear. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in China, it is important to consider the following facts: 1. Underreporting of cases: There are concerns that the official case counts may not fully capture the extent of the outbreak due to limited testing capacity and the possibility of mild or asymptomatic cases going undetected. This makes it challenging to accurately predict the number of hospitalizations that may be required. 2. Impact of "zero-COVID" policy: China's strict adherence to the "zero-COVID" strategy means that even a small number of cases can trigger lockdowns and strict control measures. This could result in a higher proportion of cases being identified and isolated, potentially reducing the strain on the healthcare system compared to a more relaxed approach. 3. Hospital capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units, and medical staff will play a crucial role in managing the surge in cases. However, there are concerns that the healthcare system could become overwhelmed if the outbreak continues to grow, particularly in areas with limited resources. 4. Vaccination rates: The effectiveness of China's vaccination campaign will influence the severity of cases and subsequent hospitalization rates. While a high proportion of the population has been vaccinated, there are still vulnerable groups, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, who may be at higher risk of severe disease. 5. New variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants, such as the recently detected Omicron variant, could impact hospitalization forecasts. If a new variant is more transmissible or causes more severe disease, it could lead to a higher number of hospitalizations, even among vaccinated individuals. Based on these factors, it is challenging to accurately forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in China. The strict "zero-COVID" policy may help to contain the outbreak and reduce hospitalizations, but there are still many uncertainties, including the potential impact of new variants and the capacity of the healthcare system to cope with a large influx of cases. It is important for authorities to closely monitor the situation, ensure adequate resources are in place, and encourage vulnerable groups to get vaccinated to help mitigate the impact of the outbreak.

Title: Canada at a Glance, 2022
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Canada was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020, with social distancing, remote work, and school closures becoming the new normal. The article provides an overview of the social, demographic, and economic impacts of the pandemic on the country. Social and Demographic Impacts: Canada's population growth slowed in 2020 to 0.4%, the lowest since World War I, while the annual number of deaths surpassed 300,000 for the first time, an increase of 8%. Immigration contributed to population growth, and since late 2021, immigration has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The pandemic caused excess mortality, with higher-than-expected deaths not all directly caused by COVID-19 but also by factors like poisonings and opioid overdoses. The pandemic accelerated the trend of moving away from urban centers, with some of the fastest-growing small towns located within a two-hour drive of major cities. Mental health was impacted, with individuals experiencing severe anxiety, depression, and psychological distress facing negative consequences, including increased suicidal ideation. Parents or guardians of minor children also faced additional challenges. Economic Impacts: Consumer inflation has outpaced average wage growth since spring 2021, putting a strain on households. Inflation rose 7.0% year-over-year in August 2022. Total employment has rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but job vacancies remain high, indicating a labor supply and demand imbalance. Vacancies neared one million in Q2 2022, with a vacancy rate of 5.7%. Business insolvencies have been lower than pre-pandemic levels but rose 37% in Q4 2021. Government support programs were critical for many businesses during the pandemic. These social, demographic, and economic impacts provide context for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Understanding population changes, excess mortality, and mental health issues helps anticipate potential healthcare needs. Additionally, economic factors like inflation and employment levels can influence healthcare-seeking behavior and resource allocation. While the article doesn't provide specific data on hospitalization forecasts, it offers insights into the broader impacts of the pandemic, which could inform predictions and planning for healthcare services and resources.

Title: COVID-19 disrupts gut microbiome
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses research that suggests COVID-19 may disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to an increased risk of dangerous secondary infections. Here is a summary: The gut microbiome refers to the trillions of microbes (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that live in the gut and play an important role in health. COVID-19 patients often have imbalances in their gut microbes, which can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. An NIH-funded research team investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gut microbes of mice and found that it led to a loss of species diversity and changes to the gut lining. In a quarter of stool samples from COVID-19 patients, a single bacterial genus dominated, including opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patients with secondary bloodstream infections tended to have less diverse gut microbes, and sequencing suggested that the infection may migrate from the gut to the bloodstream. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly disrupts the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of dangerous secondary bacterial infections. This research has important implications for understanding and managing COVID-19 hospitalizations. By identifying patients at risk of secondary infections, doctors can improve patient care and potentially reduce the severity and impact of COVID-19 on the gut microbiome.

Here is a summary of the key findings from the COVID-19 Defence Team Survey, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Survey Overview: The COVID-19 Defence Team Survey aimed to understand the impacts of the pandemic on the Defence Team, including military and public service personnel. Over 27,000 individuals shared their insights. The results will guide organizational decisions and support strategies. Top Concerns: Regardless of their role, the top four concerns reported by all groups were the wellbeing of their spouse/partner and children, a loved one contracting COVID-19, and the health of medically vulnerable loved ones. Spousal Employment: The pandemic impacted the employment of military spouses, with one-third experiencing reduced hours and one-sixth losing their jobs. Mental Health: Nearly half of DND Public Service personnel and a third of military personnel reported worsening mental health since the pandemic began. Increased stress levels were also noted, with 10% of military personnel and 19% of DND Public Service personnel experiencing much worse stress. However, most Defence Team members are managing well, and some sought mental health care (mostly virtual). Physical Health: About half of Regular Force members and DND Public Service personnel, and 42% of Primary Reserve personnel, reported a decline in their physical health. Many maintained their physical and mental health by exercising outdoors, eating healthily, and staying connected with loved ones. Organizational Support: Most respondents felt that the organization and their supervisors provided support and effectively addressed and communicated COVID-19-related issues. Supervisors and leadership/management were also identified as primary sources of information about organizational measures. Additional Resources: The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces implemented programs and resources to support the physical and mental wellbeing of the Defence Team. Existing programs like the Canadian Forces Member Assistance Program and the Employee Assistance Program were supplemented with new resources and orders to provide clarity and assistance to team members. These findings provide insight into the challenges faced by Defence Team members during the pandemic and can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying areas of concern and prioritizing support for personnel and their families. The organization's focus on support and communication has been generally well-received, and ongoing efforts to address the needs identified in the survey will likely contribute to the team's resilience and ability to cope with the impacts of the pandemic.

Title: Flu, COVID-19 and more: Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy expert on the importance of getting vaccinated
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: University of Toronto expert Natalie Crown, a professor and director of the doctor of pharmacy program, emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated against both the flu and COVID-19 to protect oneself and vulnerable individuals in the community. With the respiratory virus season arriving and the ongoing circulation of COVID-19, hospitals and the healthcare system are already under immense strain. The national tracking system FluWatch reports an above-average percentage of hospital visits by patients with flu-like symptoms. In response, the University of Toronto is offering COVID-19 and flu vaccine clinics across its campuses, including a unique lay vaccinator pilot program involving students. Crown highlights that getting vaccinated is one of the best measures to lessen the burden on the healthcare system, along with wearing masks, handwashing, and staying home when sick. She confirms that it is safe for individuals aged five and over to receive both vaccines on the same day. She also explains how vaccines work by imitating the virus, allowing the body to recognize and quickly fight off the infection. When it comes to managing anxiety or fear about getting vaccinated, Crown introduces the CARD (Comfort-Ask-Relax-Distract) system. This system addresses concerns by inviting individuals to ask questions, express their preferences, and employ strategies such as deep breathing, distraction techniques, and having a support person present during vaccination. To stay "up to date" with vaccinations means to receive all recommended vaccines considering one's age, risk factors, and medical conditions. Receiving a COVID-19 booster is advised if it has been at least three months since the last booster or infection. By following these measures and staying informed, individuals can protect themselves and others while helping to forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Women are struggling to regain lost ground in the workforce after COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities between men and women in Canada. Women's workforce participation decreased at the start of the pandemic, and the recovery has been slow, widening the gender gap in the workforce. This gap is evident in both workforce participation and unemployment rates, with more men joining and remaining in the workforce during and after the pandemic. The pandemic has also impacted the type of work men and women do, with more women working part-time due to caregiving responsibilities. This reflects the historical trend of women performing more unpaid caregiving labor, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. However, there is a promising shift towards men taking on more caregiving responsibilities, which may help to reduce gender inequalities in the future. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered. Firstly, the impact of the pandemic on healthcare capacity and resources, including the number of available hospital beds, intensive care units, and healthcare staff, needs to be assessed. Secondly, the infection rate and the severity of COVID-19 cases in the population should be monitored, as a higher number of severe cases will lead to more hospitalizations. Thirdly, the vaccination rate and the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalizations should be taken into account. Finally, the impact of any public health measures, such as social distancing, mask mandates, and travel restrictions, on reducing the spread of the virus and hospitalizations should be considered. By analyzing these factors and using data-driven models, forecasts can be made to estimate the expected number and rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations.

As of November 17, 2022, British Columbians with COVID-19 are no longer required to self-isolate, according to updated guidelines from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. This change was not widely publicized, in contrast to previous modifications to COVID-19 protocols. Dr. Bonnie Henry briefly mentioned the change, attributing it to the difficulty in differentiating between COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) symptoms. The new guidance does not distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. This shift in policy means there are effectively no formal COVID-19 restrictions for the public in B.C., even as other jurisdictions consider reinstating mask mandates. Experts like Sally Otto, the Canada Research Chair in Theoretical and Experimental Evolution at UBC, suggest that people should continue to stay home and isolate if they test positive for COVID-19, as they are likely infectious. As of now, there are 328 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in B.C., with 26 in critical care. The rise in respiratory illnesses, including flu, COVID-19, and RSV, emphasizes the importance of monitoring these trends to forecast hospitalizations and inform public health measures.
