Title: Drought, deforestation in Amazon exacerbate COVID-19 impact: U of T researcher
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The Amazon rainforest is facing multiple threats, including tree removal, land clearing for agriculture, and drought, which are endangering the lives and livelihoods of Indigenous populations. The COVID-19 pandemic has added a new layer of complexity to this already dire situation. Deforestation, fire-associated land clearing, and drought have all contributed to an increase in respiratory health issues, making the population more vulnerable to the virus. The toxic smoke from forest fires can cause shortness of breath, coughing, and lung damage, and studies have suggested a link between air pollutants and COVID-19 infection. The governance crisis in Brazil has led to a rise in deforestation, and the pre-existing conditions of deforestation and drought have fueled fires and respiratory health crises. The current wet season will provide only temporary relief, as the dry season later this year will bring back the risk of further ecological devastation and loss of life. The land surface temperature in the region remains above the historical average, indicating that the impacts of last year's dry season may extend into 2021. The combination of smoke inhalation and COVID-19 infection could have catastrophic consequences for the Amazon region, particularly for traditional and Indigenous communities.

The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has released its COVID-19 vaccination strategy, "Immunity for our Communities," which aims to vaccinate 75% of the territory's eligible population aged 18 and over. The strategy, developed with input from Indigenous governments and based on recommendations from the National Advisory Council for Immunizations (NACI), prioritizes equitable access, cultural competency, and flexibility in response to the unique challenges of the territory. Vaccinations began on December 31, 2020, with residents and staff of long-term care homes in Behchoko and Yellowknife receiving the first doses. The Moderna vaccine was chosen for its ease of shipping and storage in remote communities. A phased approach is being implemented, prioritizing those at highest risk, including the elderly, those with existing chronic diseases, frontline healthcare workers, resident workers traveling in and out of the territory, and residents of remote communities with limited health infrastructure. The general population is expected to have access to vaccines starting in March 2021. Travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements will be re-evaluated as vaccination levels increase. This strategy emphasizes the importance of community engagement and trusted sources of vaccine information to ensure a successful rollout.

A 35-year-old woman, Silatik Qavvik, from the Belcher Islands community of Sanikiluaq, has died in Winnipeg from COVID-19, leaving behind her newborn daughter, husband, and four other children. Qavvik contracted the virus while traveling to give birth, as Iqaluit is the only community in Nunavut that can medically support childbirth. This highlights the risks faced by women in the region who must travel during the pandemic for prenatal and maternal care. The MLA for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Cathy Towtongie, emphasizes the need for a birthing center with Inuit midwives in the region, as traveling for childbirth can be traumatic for expectant mothers. Currently, many residents from Nunavut and the Kivalliq region travel to Winnipeg for medical treatment, where active case counts are high. To prevent further deaths, Towtongie calls for a strategy from the Health department. The article also notes that the government of Nunavut's death count does not include residents who die while receiving medical care in other jurisdictions.

Title: COVID-19 shows the cracks in public education – here’s how to repair them
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False

Canada is unique among other countries in that it does not have a national department of education; instead, the responsibility for education falls to the provinces and territories. While there have been calls for the creation of a national education ministry, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the author argues that this would be an unnecessary and unconstitutional incursion into provincial jurisdiction. Instead, the focus should be on improving the existing educational systems through practical steps such as collecting identity-based data to identify and address barriers faced by specific groups of students and better engaging with communities in policy development. The provinces and territories have already demonstrated their ability to create robust public education systems, and further cooperation and collaboration between them, as well as improved engagement with stakeholders, will help to strengthen and improve these systems. Additionally, the federal government can play an indirect role by investing in better data collection through Statistics Canada to help provinces and territories make informed interventions.
