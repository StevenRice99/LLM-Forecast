Title: Real wages and productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article examines the relationship between real wages and labor productivity in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically from Q1 2019 to Q2 2022. It finds that while real wages (total compensation per hour worked deflated by the GDP deflator) declined by 7.1% during this period, labor productivity declined by only 0.3%. This gap between real wage and labor productivity growth is close to the upper limit of its historical range. The article also notes that real wages calculated using the consumer price index (CPI) have risen by 3.6% during the same period, indicating a relative increase in the price of goods and services produced by workers compared to those consumed by them. The article discusses the potential impact of the oil and gas sector on the relationship between real wages and labor productivity. Excluding this sector, the decline in real wages relative to labor productivity is smaller (3.5% vs. 2.1%) but still significant. Overall, the findings suggest that the increase in wages may not be fully aligned with price increases and fundamentals, and that factors such as industry composition and production technologies may be influencing the relationship between real wages and labor productivity in Canada during the pandemic.

Title: Tuberculosis deaths and disease increase during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2022 Global TB report, which provides an estimate of the tuberculosis (TB) incidence and mortality worldwide in 2021. Here are the key points and important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: In 2021, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with TB, a 4.5% increase from 2020, resulting in 1.6 million deaths, including 187,000 among HIV-positive individuals. The burden of drug-resistant TB increased by 3% between 2020 and 2021, with 450,000 new cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted TB services, contributing to the increase in TB cases and deaths. Ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have further exacerbated the situation for vulnerable populations. There has been a decline in global spending on essential TB services, with a decrease from $6 billion in 2019 to $5.4 billion in 2021, well below the global target of $13 billion annually by 2022. The number of people diagnosed with TB decreased, suggesting an increase in undiagnosed and untreated cases, leading to more TB deaths and community transmission. However, there have been small gains, with 26.3 million people treated for TB between 2018 and 2021, and some countries achieving high levels of treatment coverage. The report emphasizes the need for urgent measures to restore access to essential TB services, increase investments, and address broader determinants of TB epidemics. TB is the second deadliest infectious disease after COVID-19, caused by bacteria that affect the lungs and can spread through coughing. Most new TB cases are attributed to risk factors such as undernutrition, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking, and diabetes. Economic and financial barriers can hinder access to TB diagnosis and treatment, with about half of TB patients facing catastrophic total costs. Progress towards universal health coverage, improved social protection, and multisectoral action on broader TB determinants are crucial to reduce the burden of TB. 30 countries, including India, China, South Africa, Brazil, and Indonesia, carry the highest burden of TB. This article highlights the ongoing challenges in the fight against TB and the need for increased efforts to diagnose, treat, and prevent TB, especially in vulnerable populations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts has disrupted TB services and contributed to the rise in TB cases and deaths. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of the pandemic and the impact of various factors, including vaccination rates, emerging variants, and public health measures. However, the ongoing disruptions to healthcare services, including TB diagnosis and treatment, could indirectly affect COVID-19 hospitalizations by increasing the risk of coinfections and compromising overall health systems' capacity to manage both diseases effectively.

Title: Ontario's COVID-19 hospitalizations highest in 8 months; 121 new deaths reported
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations, with 1,921 reported hospitalizations, the highest since February 9th when there were 2,059 hospitalizations. The Ministry of Health's weekly data release showed an increase in hospitalizations compared to the previous week's report (1,663). The number of intensive care patients with COVID-19 has decreased slightly from 158 to 148, but patients requiring ventilators have increased to 57. Test positivity is slightly down at 16.1%. However, experts caution that reported case counts may underestimate the actual number of infections. The province's wastewater signal indicates that the prevalence of the virus is rising, predicting a marked increase in the coming weeks. Toronto, which recently marked 1,000 days since its first COVID-19 case, warns that the virus has a higher chance of spreading as people move indoors during fall and winter. Bivalent vaccines targeting the Omicron variant are recommended for added protection.

Title: Fewer than one in five Canadians have received a COVID-19 booster shot
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Most Canadians have not received their COVID-19 booster shots, which puts them at higher risk of infection and severe illness as cases rise and new variants emerge. Experts attribute this delay partly to weak public messaging about the importance of staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations. With a potential new wave approaching, experts emphasize the need to strengthen communication and policy decisions regarding vaccinations, masks, and other preventive measures. Only 17% of Canadians have received a booster or completed their initial vaccine series within the past six months, which is concerning as vaccine immunity wanes after six months. The upcoming COVID-19 wave will further strain Canadian hospitals, which are already facing staff shortages and high demand. New variants, such as BQ.1, pose a greater threat to vulnerable individuals as common treatments like monoclonal antibodies are ineffective against them. While Health Canada has approved two new bivalent vaccines targeting Omicron-related variants, experts believe that public perception of the vaccines' importance needs to be addressed, as only 14% of Canadians have received two additional shots. To mitigate the impact of the impending wave, experts stress the importance of maintaining vaccinations and mask-wearing to reduce virus transmission.

Title: COVID-19: Suicidal ideation among adults in Canada during the pandemic: Infographic
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Title: Suicidal Ideation among Adults in Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted various economic, psychosocial, and health-related factors contributing to suicidal ideation in adults. A survey conducted in Canada during the pandemic revealed a concerning increase in suicidal thoughts among adults compared to pre-pandemic data. The survey highlighted specific sociodemographic groups and pandemic-related factors that were more susceptible to suicidal ideation. Young adults, individuals with mental health disorders, and those facing multiple pandemic-related challenges were at a significantly higher risk. While suicidal thoughts increased, suicide rates have not shown a corresponding rise, although this data may change with further analysis and updated figures. Key Facts for COVID-19 Hospitalization Forecasting: During the pandemic, 4.2% of Canadian adults reported suicidal ideation in spring 2021, a significant increase from 2.7% pre-pandemic (2019) and 2.4% in fall 2020. Adults aged 18-34 were nine times more likely to report suicidal thoughts, and adults aged 35-64 were four times more likely, compared to those 65 and over. Adults who experienced feelings of loneliness or isolation were eight times more likely to have suicidal ideation. Those who faced challenges with their physical health during the pandemic were four times more likely to report suicidal thoughts. Individuals with moderate to severe symptoms of mental illnesses, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, were significantly more likely to experience suicidal ideation (14 times and 10 times more likely, respectively). The likelihood of suicidal ideation increased with the number of pandemic-related impacts, such as financial difficulties, job loss, and personal relationship issues. These key facts can help identify high-risk groups that may require additional mental health support and intervention to potentially reduce the risk of suicide attempts and hospitalizations related to mental health crises during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: The pandemic’s true death toll
Publisher: The Economist
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the challenges of determining the accurate number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Official death tolls rely on data from confirmed COVID-19 cases, but many infected individuals may not have been tested or included in the statistics. The definition of "because" in relation to COVID-19 deaths is also ambiguous, as some people may have had other underlying ailments that contributed to their death. The article introduces the concept of "excess deaths," which calculates the difference between the expected number of deaths in a given region during a typical time period and the actual number of deaths during the pandemic. By considering all deaths regardless of the cause, excess deaths provide a more comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact. The article estimates that the actual death toll from COVID-19 is higher than the official count, suggesting that there is a 95% probability that the true number lies within a range of additional deaths. This range highlights the uncertainty surrounding the true impact of the pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 Surges Linked to Spike in Heart Attacks
Publisher: Cedars-Sinai
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A recent study by the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai found that heart attack deaths increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, reversing the previous declining trend. The analysis revealed several key findings: 1. Pre-pandemic, there were 143,787 heart attack deaths, but this number increased by 14% to 164,096 in the first year of the pandemic. 2. The increase in heart attack-related deaths was consistent across all age groups, but the relative rise was most significant for young adults between 25 and 44. 3. In the second year of the pandemic, the observed heart attack death rates had increased by 29.9% for adults aged 25-44, 19.6% for adults aged 45-64, and 13.7% for adults aged 65 and older compared to predicted rates. 4. The researchers suggested several potential explanations for the rise in cardiac deaths, including the possibility that COVID-19 may trigger or accelerate existing coronary artery disease, even in younger individuals. 5. The increase in heart-related conditions could also be linked to pandemic-related stress and social factors such as job loss and financial pressures. 6. The sharp rise in heart attack deaths during the pandemic is unusual compared to the risks associated with other infections like the flu. 7. The researchers emphasized the need for further research and awareness to improve the medical community's ability to manage and mitigate these risks. This study highlights the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart health and suggests that COVID-19 may have long-term cardiovascular consequences, even in younger individuals who are not typically considered high-risk for heart attacks. These findings could be valuable for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as they indicate an increased risk of heart-related complications, particularly during pandemic surges.

Title: COVID fallout—a provincial breakdown of the numbers
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Canada's economy, with a 5.2% decline in real GDP in 2020 and projected growth of 4.6%, 3.9%, and 2.8% for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. The pandemic's effect varied across provinces, with Alberta experiencing the most significant economic downturn in 2020, while the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia were relatively less affected. In terms of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, and Manitoba had the highest incidence, while the Atlantic provinces were the least affected. Quebec had the highest mortality rate, while Prince Edward Island had the lowest. During the pandemic, British Columbia had the highest total employment growth, followed by Nova Scotia and Alberta. However, higher economic growth did not always translate into higher employment growth. British Columbia also led in real GDP growth, followed by Prince Edward Island and Ontario. New Brunswick, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador had the lowest average annual growth. Overall, the pandemic's impact on the provinces was mixed. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Quebec had the highest COVID-19 incidence, but their economic and fiscal outcomes varied. The Atlantic provinces successfully managed COVID-19 incidence and mortality, but their economic performance was mixed. British Columbia and Nova Scotia appeared to balance managing the pandemic and achieving relatively good economic outcomes. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors could be considered, including vaccination rates, booster uptake, and the implementation of public health measures. Provinces with higher vaccination coverage and effective public health strategies may be better positioned to reduce hospitalizations. Additionally, the availability of healthcare resources, such as ICU beds and healthcare staff, could influence a province's ability to manage COVID-19 hospitalizations effectively.
