Title: B.C. COVID-19 hospitalizations hit their lowest level in almost 2 years this month
Publisher: CTV News Vancouver
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Low hospitalization numbers are reported in B.C., which may be indicative of declining transmission trends.
Wastewater data shows decreasing concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also suggesting a decline in transmission.
Hospitalization numbers have dropped across all regional health authorities in B.C., with Vancouver Coastal Health having the lowest number (20) as of June 1.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Province-wide or region-specific wastewater surveillance data
Current and historical hospitalization trends by health authority
Vaccination rates and coverage in Ontario

Title: Data shows COVID-19 hospitalizations, severe outcomes continue to decline, but we must remain vigilant: experts
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Hospitalization numbers have been on a steady decline since winter.
As of the latest data, there are still around 2,000 people in hospital and about 130 in ICU due to COVID-19.
Experts warn that despite declining trends, the virus is still present and will continue to circulate for an indefinite period.
Wastewater testing has become a crucial part of COVID-19 surveillance and can help determine if COVID-19 is increasing or decreasing in a community.
Ontario's move to weekly reporting of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths suggests that monitoring is still important.

Title: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in Canada: population-based surveillance and role of SARS-CoV-2 linkage
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article discusses a study on Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS), a rare but serious complication of COVID-19 infection in children. The study was conducted using data from the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) and included 416 cases of PIMS reported between April 2020 and May 2021.
Key findings of the study include:
1. Incidence: The minimum national incidence of PIMS hospitalization was 5.6 per 100,000 population, and for ICU admission was 1.8 per 100,000 population.
2. Risk factors: Children aged 6-12 years were at highest risk of ICU admission, as well as those with positive SARS-CoV-2 linkages.
3. Clinical characteristics: Almost one in three hospitalized children required ICU admission and respiratory/hemodynamic support.
4. Temporal relationship: Peaks of PIMS hospitalizations correlated with a temporal lag of five weeks after peaks in all Canadian SARS-CoV-2 infections.
5. Geographic variability: Higher numbers of cases were seen in three Canadian jurisdictions (Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta) with the highest numbers of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The study also discusses limitations, including:
1. Voluntary reporting: The study relies on voluntary reporting by healthcare providers, which may lead to underreporting.
2. Limited data collection: The online PIMS case report form was developed soon after the first identification of the clinical entity, and some important clinical or laboratory markers were not included in the study.
The study's conclusions are:
1. PIMS is a rare but serious complication: While PIMS is rare, it remains an important consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
2. Importance of vaccination: The study highlights the importance of vaccination of eligible children as early evidence supports this to be effective at preventing PIMS in adolescents.
3. Variability in incidence: The incidence of PIMS may change with future variants of SARS-CoV-2, and ongoing monitoring is essential.
Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of PIMS in Canada and informs clinical practice and public health responses to this condition.

Title: Antipsychotic drugs use increased in Canadian long-term care homes, pointing to possible quality-of-care issues: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False

Relevant.
Summary: 
10% increase in risk-adjusted odds of potentially inappropriate antipsychotic drug use in Ontario.
In Ontario, antipsychotic drug usage without diagnosis went from 18.3% in 2019/2020 to 19.3% in 2020/2021.
Increase may be related to pre-emptive use during outbreaks and staffing shortages in long-term care homes.
