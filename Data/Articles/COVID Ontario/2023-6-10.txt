Title: Opinion: We are in denial about the huge consequences of long COVID on Canadians’ health
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the long-term effects of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, and its impact on forecasting hospitalizations. Here's a summary: Long COVID is more prevalent and disabling than expected, with global data suggesting almost half of COVID-19 survivors reporting persistent symptoms four months after their diagnosis. Post-COVID-19 syndrome involves a variety of new, returning, or continuing symptoms lasting more than four weeks after the initial infection, including fatigue, neurological issues, respiratory problems, joint pain, digestive problems, and mental health issues. The incidence of long COVID is higher among those who were hospitalized, the unvaccinated, and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and asthma. The inflammatory response triggered by the infection can lead to organ damage, including lung damage, cardiovascular problems, kidney injury, and an increased risk of diabetes. There is emerging evidence of brain changes and neurological symptoms associated with long COVID, including brain fog, memory loss, and sleep disturbances. The mental health consequences of the pandemic are significant, and the damage to various aspects of society underscores the need for a full-scale government inquiry into the handling of COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness. The article emphasizes that the long-term effects of COVID-19 are extensive and understudied, highlighting the importance of considering long COVID when forecasting hospitalizations and planning for future pandemics.

Title: SME Failures Under Large Liquidity Shocks: An Application to the COVID-19 Crisis
Publisher: Bank of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article examines the impact of financial constraints on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) during the COVID-19 crisis. Here is a summary: The authors develop a model that considers how financial frictions, such as limited borrowing capacity, can interact with liquidity shocks to drive firm exit. The model is applied to a sample of SMEs in 11 European countries, accurately predicting official failure rates between 2017-2019, a period of normal business cycle fluctuations. During the COVID-19 crisis, a large liquidity shock, the model predicts that without government support, SME failure rates would have increased by 6.01 percentage points, endangering 3.1% of employment. The results suggest that financial frictions contribute to inefficient exit, as failing firms had similar productivity and growth to survivors, indicating that financial constraints, not just firm performance, influenced survival during the pandemic. This study highlights the role of financial frictions in firm survival during economic crises and supports the idea that government support can help mitigate the impact of liquidity shocks on SMEs, which could have significant effects on forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. The potential loss of employment due to SME failures could indirectly affect healthcare demand and resources, as job loss is associated with changes in healthcare access and utilization. Additionally, the economic fallout from high SME failure rates could exacerbate social and economic inequalities, influencing the ability of different populations to protect themselves from infection and access healthcare.

Title: Ontario to stop free COVID-19 rapid test program in pharmacies, grocery stores
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Ontario government has announced that its program providing free rapid COVID-19 tests at grocery stores and pharmacies will conclude by the end of June. This decision comes as COVID-19 rates are decreasing, vaccination rates are high, and demand for tests is low. However, this has sparked concerns about access to testing for vulnerable communities. While the Ministry of Health assures that free rapid tests will still be distributed in "high-priority" communities through specific organizations until the end of the year, critics argue that the tests should remain accessible to all Ontarians, especially those in rural and northern areas who may not be able to afford them otherwise. This debate occurs alongside worries about temporary ER closures and limited access to primary care in the province.

Publisher: Borden Ladner Gervais LLP (BLG)
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic had significant negative effects on the mental health of students, with many experiencing depression, worse mental health, and psychological distress. The increase in online activity during lockdowns and school closures may have contributed to these issues. While bullying rates initially decreased during the pandemic, research in the U.K. suggests that it has increased again as students returned to school, with a rise in online harassment and negative social media usage. Canadian studies also indicate high social media usage and cyberbullying experiences among students. To address these issues and create a positive school climate, educators should: Implement bullying prevention and intervention programs that are evidence-based, whole-school, and multi-tiered. Involve students, parents, and community partners in creating and evaluating bullying prevention initiatives. Seek feedback from parents and examine practices from a student-centered perspective. Develop a culture of caring and strengthen leadership skills to drive cultural change. Ensure policies and procedures are equitable, anti-racist, and anti-oppression, and consistently followed. These steps can help create a safer and more positive environment for students as they navigate the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations may involve considering the mental health and well-being of students, as the pandemic has had a significant impact in this area, potentially leading to increased health service utilization.

Title: Mental health must be top of the political agenda post-COVID-19, PAHO report says
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of people in the Americas, with the region already facing significant mental health challenges before the pandemic. The Director of PAHO, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, emphasized the need for mental health to be a top priority in political agendas and integrated into various sectors and policies. The report, "A New Agenda for Mental Health in the Region of the Americas," provides recommendations to improve mental health care and address issues such as low investment, overreliance on hospitalization, and a shortage of trained personnel. It highlights the lack of access to care for the majority of those with mental health conditions, with over 80% of people with severe mental health issues not receiving treatment in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased risk factors for mental health problems, including unemployment and financial insecurity. To address these challenges, PAHO established the High-Level Commission on Mental Health and COVID-19, which provided guidance to improve mental health during and after the pandemic. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations based on this article: The lack of access to mental health care and increased risk factors due to the pandemic may contribute to higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates, as mental health issues can impact overall health and wellbeing. Addressing mental health disparities and improving access to care could potentially help reduce the burden on healthcare systems and lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Integrating mental health into policies and increasing investment in mental health services may help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalizations over the long term.

Title: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals has been slowed by indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
COVID-19 has negatively impacted 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the top five goals experiencing the greatest direct impacts being eradicating poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and reduced inequality (SDG 10). The pandemic has had negative consequences on all SDGs to varying degrees, including restricted activities, slowed economies, and reduced investment in areas other than health systems. The indirect impacts of COVID-19, caused by cascading effects, are seven times greater than the direct impacts on average and are most severe on SDGs 1, 9, 3, 4, 7, and 11. The shock loss and growth delay loss due to COVID-19 have significantly affected progress towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, with the goal of no poverty (SDG 1) being the most impacted. Regions like Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East are experiencing impacts above the medium level, with progress towards SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) being the most affected. The average indirect impacts of COVID-19 are more than twenty times greater than the average direct impacts across all regions and income levels. The risks of countries failing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 vary depending on their income levels and progress gaps before the pandemic.

Title: What was different about Ontario’s COVID-19 response
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, focusing on important facts and insights that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: On January 25, 2020, Ontario identified its first suspected case of COVID-19, marking the beginning of the pandemic in the province. Within two days, the provincial Ministry of Health activated its emergency response plan, demonstrating a swift initial response. The early days were characterized by uncertainty, evolving information, and varying opinions from stakeholders and the public. The government worked tirelessly to manage the situation, with daily cabinet meetings, media briefings, and the implementation of emergency measures. As the pandemic unfolded, several key factors and challenges came into play: Long-term care homes: The spread of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities highlighted the poor conditions in many homes, resulting in tragic numbers of deaths. This led to recommendations for improvements in staffing, cross-sectoral collaboration, infection control, leadership, and inspections. Data and analytics: The collection of race-based data in Ontario revealed differential outcomes and the impact of social determinants of health. The analysis showed that residents of higher-risk neighborhoods were less likely to get vaccinated, influencing targeted response strategies. Decision-making complexity: Government decision-makers navigated diverse and divergent sources of advice, including health, economic, and stakeholder perspectives. They had to balance health and economic objectives, often with imperfect information and under significant time pressure, leading to mistakes and reversals. Collaboration and coordination: There was unprecedented collaboration between different levels and jurisdictions of government. The establishment of a central coordination table helped resolve gray areas between government entities and improve the overall response. Supply chain challenges: Work on supply-chain modernization, which began before the pandemic, was accelerated to address PPE and supply shortages. Science and advisory bodies: The creation of a special-purpose science table brought together top scientific minds to inform decision-making. This dynamic between science and government decision-making continued with advisory bodies like the National Advisory Committee on Immunization and the Ontario Science Table. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and inform future pandemic responses, key takeaways include: The importance of preparedness and adaptability: While full preparation for a pandemic of this scale may be impossible, ongoing investment in emergency response capabilities is critical. Data-driven decision-making: Collecting and analyzing data on social determinants of health can inform targeted interventions and improve outcomes. Collaboration and coordination: Breaking down silos between government entities and ministries can lead to more effective responses to complex issues. Addressing vulnerabilities: The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in long-term care facilities and other congregate settings, requiring immediate and sustained action. Improving analytics and modeling: Predictive analytics and modeling capabilities need enhancement to support better decision-making during public health crises. In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges, it also offered valuable lessons for Ontario's healthcare system and government institutions. By incorporating these lessons and continuing to adapt and improve, we can build a more resilient and responsive healthcare framework for the future.

Title: Developing a global research agenda for public health and social measures: Research priorities for COVID-19
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has been conducting a multi-step consultation process to identify urgent and long-term research priorities related to public health and social measures (PHSM) for COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens. The goal is to strengthen respiratory pandemic preparedness and improve decision-making for diverse hazards. Through this process, 24 research questions across six themes have been prioritized. These themes include mapping knowledge gaps, measuring the effectiveness and impact of PHSM, assessing the health and socio-economic impacts, building preparedness and response capacity, promoting uptake and adherence to PHSM, and advancing methodological research for implementation and evaluation. Some of the key research questions include understanding the efficacy and impact of separate or combined PHSM on disease transmission, morbidity, and mortality; identifying high-risk events and settings for viral transmission; evaluating the cost-benefit ratio of PHSM considering prevented morbidity and mortality versus intervention burden; and determining the effects of PHSM on mental health and routine medical care. The next step for WHO is to launch a second online survey in summer 2023 to identify mediumto long-term research priorities beyond COVID-19. The findings will be discussed at a global expert consultation in November 2023, and a global PHSM research agenda for 2021-2030 will be published to enhance respiratory pandemic preparedness and response. This comprehensive research agenda aims to address knowledge gaps, improve PHSM implementation, and mitigate the intervention burden on individuals and societies. By advancing evidence-informed decision-making, these efforts will contribute to strengthening global health emergency preparedness, response, and resilience.
