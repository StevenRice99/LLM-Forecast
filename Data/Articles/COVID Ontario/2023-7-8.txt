Title: Accountability for Canada’s covid-19 response
Publisher: The BMJ
Trusted: True
Posted: Today
Here is a summary of the article, including key points that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The Royal Society of Canada hosted a webinar and launched a new series in The BMJ to discuss accountabilities for Canada's COVID-19 response. With over 4.6 million cases and 52,750 deaths as of mid-2023, Canada's COVID-19 death rate exceeded the global average. The pandemic disproportionately affected marginalized communities and those in long-term care homes. Canada achieved high vaccination coverage domestically but was criticized for hoarding vaccine doses and not supporting global vaccine-sharing efforts enough. The article series in The BMJ critiques Canada's response and highlights areas for improvement. It argues that Canada's decentralized approach led to fragmented data access and decision-making, and that research was not effectively used to address health inequalities. The failure to learn from the SARS epidemic in 2003 left the country unprepared. An independent national inquiry is needed to ensure accountability and improve future pandemic preparedness. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider Canada's previous response and the impact on vulnerable populations. The failure to protect long-term care home residents and staff highlights the need for coordinated efforts between federal and provincial governments. Canada's role in global vaccine equity is also crucial, as prioritizing public health over profits can help prevent future outbreaks and reduce hospitalization risks. First Nations communities in Manitoba are also highlighted for their effective COVID-19 response, emphasizing the importance of cultural safety and community-led solutions in improving access and equity for Indigenous peoples. Their successful strategies can provide valuable lessons for future pandemic planning and reducing hospitalizations.

Leanne Argoso, a 45-year-old physiotherapist from London, Ontario, Canada, contracted COVID-19 in March 2022 and became a long-hauler, experiencing long-term symptoms such as fatigue, trouble concentrating, headaches, and memory issues. Argoso's story serves as a warning to others that long COVID is real and can significantly impact one's life. She is receiving treatment through St. Joseph's Post-Acute COVID-19 Program, but the program's future is uncertain as permanent funding has not been confirmed. Colin Furness, an epidemiologist, highlights the lack of knowledge about long COVID, including risk factors and diagnostic tests. He emphasizes the need for caution as COVID is still prevalent and can have lasting effects. The unknowns about long COVID create challenges for epidemiological understanding and management. As of January 2021, St. Joseph's Healthcare has served 510 patients with over 3,300 visits, indicating a significant demand for long-COVID treatment. This article emphasizes the ongoing impact of COVID and the need for continued research, funding, and awareness.

Title: Bias assessment of a test-negative design study of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness used in national policymaking
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article describes a study that assessed the potential biases and behavioral changes related to COVID-19 vaccination in individuals aged 70 and above in England. The study used data from national vaccination records, COVID-19 testing, and a questionnaire sent to individuals who had a PCR test in February 2021. The questionnaire collected information on vaccination dates, COVID-19 risk factors, social mixing behaviors, and transportation modes to vaccination centers. The study analyzed potential biases such as exposure misclassification, outcome misclassification, and confounding from COVID-19 risk factors. It also evaluated deferral bias, where individuals delay vaccination due to COVID-19 infection or symptoms, and explored potential alternative causal pathways, including increased social mixing and exposure during travel to vaccination centers. The study used logistic regression models to assess the impact of these factors on vaccine effectiveness estimates.

Title: Toronto hospitals relax mask mandates amid lower levels of COVID-19 transmission
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False

Several Toronto hospitals have recently relaxed their mandatory masking policies, allowing visitors and staff to go without masks in most public areas, except in patient rooms and waiting areas where patients are present. This change took effect on June 27 and 28, with the Hospital for Sick Children stating that it's due to "low community transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses." Sinai Health also adjusted its policy to focus on patient care areas, remaining a "mask-friendly environment" elsewhere. The change reflects the current phase of the pandemic, with Ontario experiencing its lowest level of COVID-19 viral activity in over a year, as indicated by the province's wastewater surveillance program. Hospitalizations in Toronto have also decreased, with only 36 hospitalizations last week, a significant drop from previous months and earlier in the pandemic. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch attributes these policy changes to the current state of the pandemic, recognizing that COVID-19 trends in Ontario communities and hospitals have decreased. The new masking policies vary across hospitals but generally mandate face coverings in emergency departments and during direct patient interactions. Additionally, masking rules remain stricter in areas caring for immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer wards. These changes follow similar updates to masking policies in Hamilton hospitals, where patients and visitors are no longer required to wear masks, and healthcare workers use a risk assessment to determine necessary PPE.

The study assessed the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load in untreated wastewater and COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario, Canada. Wastewater surveillance has become important due to restricted clinical testing during the Omicron wave. Untreated wastewater samples were collected from two treatment plants, and viral RNA was extracted for RT-PCR testing. COVID-19 case and hospitalization data were also obtained. The data was stratified by successive COVID-19 waves, and correlations were calculated between wastewater viral loads and cases/hospitalizations. Key findings include: During the second, third, and fourth COVID-19 waves, the median daily SARS-CoV-2 load was twice as high at the G.E. Booth plant compared to the Clarkson plant. Clinical PCR testing and positivity rates were low during the fourth wave, which was dominated by the Delta variant. During the Omicron BA.1 dominant fifth wave, the magnitude of cases did not align with wastewater viral loads. The daily median load was much higher during the Omicron BA.2 predominant sixth wave. Correlations between wastewater viral loads and reported cases were strongest on the sampling date, especially during the third wave (Alpha-dominant). The highest correlation between total viral loads and hospitalizations occurred during the third and fifth waves, with a weak association during the Delta wave. The median wastewater viral load-to-case ratios were significantly higher during the fifth and sixth waves. The linear regression model predicted a significant underestimation of COVID-19 cases during the fifth and sixth waves, with 6.5-fold and 18.7-fold higher predicted cases than reported, respectively. In conclusion, changes in clinical PCR testing policies likely led to an underestimation of local SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Wastewater surveillance data provides valuable insights into COVID-19 prevalence and can aid in local decision-making. The study highlights the utility of wastewater monitoring, especially when clinical testing capacity is overwhelmed or restricted.

The article provides a table with COVID-19 hospitalization risk levels for each state in the US, as well as some territories and Canadian provinces. The risk levels are categorized as low, medium, high, or very high and are based on factors such as the number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity, and the rate of bed and staff availability. As of the article's publication, most states (38) are at a high or very high risk, while only two states (New Hampshire and New Jersey) are at low risk. The remaining states are at medium risk. The data also shows that the risk level varies across different regions, with the South and Midwest experiencing higher hospitalization rates compared to the West and Northeast. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article suggests monitoring factors such as the positivity rate (the percentage of positive tests out of total tests administered), the reproductive rate (the average number of people infected by each infected person), and the vaccination rate. A combination of high positivity and reproductive rates, along with a low vaccination rate, could indicate a potential increase in hospitalizations in the near future. Additionally, the article highlights the impact of variants on hospitalization risk. The presence of more transmissible or severe variants, such as the Delta variant, can lead to a rapid increase in cases and hospitalizations. Tracking the spread of variants and their impact on different demographics can help forecast the strain on healthcare resources. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that the COVID-19 hospitalization situation is dynamic and can change quickly. By considering factors such as hospitalization rates, variant spread, and vaccination progress, public health officials and healthcare providers can better prepare for surges and allocate resources effectively to manage the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems.
