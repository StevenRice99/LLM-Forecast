Title: Yes, vaccines curb COVID-19 transmission — but that's not enough to protect those without a shot

The article discusses the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalizations and deaths from the virus. It highlights several studies that have shown a significant decrease in infections among unvaccinated youth when vaccination rates in their communities are high.
A study published in the journal Science found that when COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out in 177 communities, the rates of vaccination were associated with a later decline in infections among unvaccinated youth. The researchers found that for every 20 percentage points of individuals who were vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold.
Another study from Public Health England found that three weeks after people received a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, household transmission of the virus was reduced between 40 and 50 per cent.
However, despite these findings, COVID-19 cases are still spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa where vaccination rates are low. The delta variant is also becoming more prevalent even in highly vaccinated countries, which could lead to a resurgence of hospitalizations and deaths from the virus.
The article highlights the importance of getting COVID-19 vaccines distributed globally, particularly to areas with high transmission rates, to reduce the toll of the pandemic.
