Title: Ontario’s Community-Dwelling Older Adults Who Remain Unvaccinated Against COVID-19
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses COVID-19 vaccination rates among community-dwelling older adults in Ontario, Canada, as of June 7, 2021. It finds that 83% of community-dwelling older adults had received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but rates were lower for those aged 80 and above, with only a 4% improvement in this age group during the study period. The majority of unvaccinated older adults were women. Vaccination rates were also lower in neighborhoods with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, more material deprivation, and greater ethnic diversity. Older adults without a primary care physician had lower vaccination rates, with only 45.9% receiving one dose compared to 76.8% with an assigned physician and 86.5% rostered to a primary care practice. Inequities in vaccination were most pronounced among the 6% of older adults without a regular primary care physician. Access may be a major reason for low vaccination rates, especially for older women who are more likely to live alone. The findings suggest that making the vaccine more accessible could increase vaccination rates among older adults. The majority of unvaccinated older adults (65.8%) are cared for within a rostered primary care practice, highlighting the need to target this group with tailored strategies.

Title: Strengthening Economic Resilience Following the COVID-19 Crisis
Publisher: OECD
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains and the policies that can be used to mitigate these challenges. Here is a summary: Title: Securing Global Value Chains in the Post-Pandemic World Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly due to the concentration of certain value chain activities in specific regions or countries. This has led to disruptions and shortages worldwide. To address these challenges, the article proposes several policies and strategies: Geographic Diversification: Companies should consider diversifying their supplier base and manufacturing locations to reduce reliance on a single region or country. This strategy can help mitigate risks associated with pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical tensions. Reshoring and Nearshoring: Bringing production closer to home, either back to the company's domestic market (reshoring) or to nearby countries (nearshoring), can reduce logistical challenges and improve supply chain resilience. Strategic Stockpiling: Governments and companies can maintain reserves of critical supplies and raw materials to ensure availability during crises. Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience: This includes improving supply chain visibility, developing contingency plans, investing in digital technologies for better supply chain management, and enhancing collaboration between the public and private sectors. International Cooperation: Collaboration between countries can help ensure a stable and secure global supply chain. This includes information sharing, harmonizing standards, and establishing agreements to facilitate trade and investment. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and inform policy decisions, the following factors are important: Infection rates: Monitoring the number of new infections and the rate at which the virus is spreading can help predict the potential demand for hospital beds and intensive care units. Transmission dynamics: Understanding the transmission patterns, including the incubation period, contagious period, and the effectiveness of public health measures, is crucial for forecasting hospitalizations. Severity of cases: Analyzing the proportion of infected individuals who require hospitalization, intensive care, or ventilation can provide insights into the strain on healthcare resources. Demographics and risk factors: Considering the demographics and underlying health conditions that increase the risk of severe illness can help identify vulnerable populations and predict hospitalization rates. Healthcare system capacity: Assessing the available hospital beds, ICU capacity, ventilators, and healthcare staff can help determine the ability to handle a surge in hospitalizations. Testing and contact tracing capacity: Efficient testing and contact tracing can help control the spread and provide data to forecast hospitalizations more accurately. Public health measures: The effectiveness of measures such as social distancing, mask mandates, travel restrictions, and vaccination rates can significantly impact hospitalization rates. By incorporating these factors into analytical models and utilizing data analytics, policymakers and healthcare professionals can better forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. This information can then inform decisions regarding resource allocation, healthcare system preparedness, and the implementation or relaxation of public health measures.

Title: Trudeau defends Canada's early response to COVID-19 but admits room for improvement
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The Canadian government has released a report reviewing the country's Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) and its early warning systems for pandemics, including COVID-19. The review found that while GPHIN identified the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019, there is room for improvement in how the Public Health Agency of Canada and other government departments use this information to prepare the country for potential threats. The panel recommended a stand-alone risk assessment office that can combine surveillance data from GPHIN and intelligence from security agencies to quickly assess risks and coordinate a response. Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner criticized the Liberal government's handling of the pandemic, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that there are always areas for improvement but defended the government's early actions, including meetings between Dr. Theresa Tam and provincial counterparts in January 2020. The report also suggested that GPHIN could benefit from private partnerships to enhance its technological capabilities.

Title: Infection prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The article provides interim guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies for health workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The scope of the guidance has been expanded to include new and revised sections on the implications of variants of concern and vaccination for IPC practices. The document is an update to a previous version published in July 2021 and reflects the latest scientific evidence on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. It includes recommendations on the use of masks and respirators for healthcare workers providing care to COVID-19 patients. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of variants of concern and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. The variants can affect the transmissibility and severity of the disease, which in turn influences the number of hospitalizations. The vaccination status of a population can also impact hospitalization rates, as vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience severe illness requiring hospitalization. Monitoring the spread of new variants and encouraging vaccination can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent hospitalizations.

Title: Canada's pandemic warning system was understaffed and unready when COVID hit, review finds
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article reveals that an independent panel found an important position at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was vacant when the COVID-19 pandemic began, and the country's early warning system for pandemics, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), was understaffed and had experienced a turnover in critical staff. The report also highlights a lack of coordination in surveillance efforts in the four years leading up to the pandemic and a problematic decision to transfer the power to issue alerts from the GPHIN team to the vice-president of the agency. The panel makes recommendations for improving GPHIN, including a clearer mandate, better technology, and more collaboration with private sector partners. It also emphasizes that pandemic surveillance is a fundamental responsibility of the government. This information is important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it provides insight into the early response to the pandemic and the challenges faced by public health agencies. The lack of coordination and staffing issues within PHAC and GPHIN may have impacted the effectiveness of surveillance and alert systems, potentially delaying or hindering the implementation of public health measures to control the spread of the virus. Additionally, the decision to change the alert approval process may have led to delays or a lack of early warnings, affecting the timing of hospitalizations. However, it is difficult to make specific forecasts or predictions about COVID-19 hospitalizations based on this information alone.

As of Sunday, Saskatchewan has lifted all public health restrictions that were put in place to manage COVID-19, including mandatory masking and limitations on gatherings. This has prompted a range of emotions among residents, with some feeling excited and relieved while others remain cautious and concerned. The province reported 113 new cases on Thursday, the largest single-day increase since early June, with slightly over 50% of residents aged 12 and up fully vaccinated. Many businesses are choosing to maintain restrictions, such as mandatory masking and monitoring capacity, to protect their staff and customers. Matthew Cardinal, a COVID-19 survivor, expressed excitement about the reopening but also fears for those who are vulnerable and cannot get vaccinated. He calls on people to respect those who continue to wear masks and take precautions. Some businesses, like Lotus & Oak Salon, will continue to require masks and distancing, while a yoga studio in Regina will require proof of vaccination for in-person classes. The government has stated that businesses can implement their own masking policies and that individuals should respect their decisions. Overall, residents are adjusting to life without restrictions while navigating their own comfort levels and taking precautions to protect themselves and others.
