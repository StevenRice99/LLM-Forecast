TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Vaccines are preventing serious infections and likely curbing transmission, but the vaccinated cannot fully protect the unvaccinated. In areas with lower vaccination rates, severe cases of COVID-19 are going down as vaccination rates go up. Breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals are rare and typically mild. Cases of serious illness leading to hospitalization or death are now largely appearing among unvaccinated populations. The delta variant is spreading rapidly in Africa, where vaccination rates are low, and is also taking hold in highly vaccinated countries such as Israel, the U.K., the U.S., and Canada. In Ontario, the delta variant makes up close to 75% of cases. Unvaccinated individuals are driving transmission, and there is a stark split in how the virus is impacting people's lives, with unprotected individuals bearing the brunt of its spread. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination rates in Ontario and other provinces Proportion of unvaccinated individuals in the population Spread of the delta variant and other variants of concern Number of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals Severity of cases among unvaccinated populations Hospitalization rates and ICU admissions among unvaccinated individuals.
