Title: Long-COVID in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analyses
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article presents a meta-analysis of the prevalence and symptoms of long-COVID in children and adolescents, with a prevalence rate of 25.24%. The most common symptoms include mood symptoms, fatigue, sleep disorders, headaches, and respiratory issues. The risk of persistent dyspnea, loss of taste/smell, and fever is higher in this population. The pandemic has had significant societal impacts, including on children's development and mental health. Symptoms of long-COVID overlap with those of dysautonomia, an autonomic nervous system dysfunction, but the connection between the two is not yet clear. Risk factors for long-COVID in children include older age, female gender, severe COVID-19, overweight/obesity, and co-morbid allergic diseases. Protective factors include fewer comorbidities, strong innate immune responses, reduced expression of ACE2 receptors, and active thymic function. The prevalence of symptoms varies with time since acute COVID-19, and most symptoms improve over time, but some can persist for a year or more. The strength of the meta-analysis lies in its large sample size, but limitations include bias and heterogeneity across studies. Future studies should include control cohorts, stratification by age, and consideration of vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The selection of controls may be challenging due to unrecorded cases, false test results, and asymptomatic children. Proposed control groups include negative antibody tests or historical cohorts unexposed to the virus. The article also includes two pre-publication studies, one with a large population and validation by medical professionals, and another with a lower estimated prevalence of 4.6%.

Title: Are 4th COVID-19 doses needed amid Omicron spread? Experts weigh in - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: It has been six months since COVID-19 booster shots were made available to all adults in Canada, and many are wondering if they should get a fourth dose. While nearly 50% of Canadians have received a third dose, fourth doses are currently only recommended for certain high-risk groups, such as adults over 80 and immunocompromised individuals. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends boosters to restore protection against the virus, as antibody levels naturally decline over time. However, experts say that healthy individuals do not need to rush to get a fourth dose immediately, given the current low transmission rates and the protection offered by the first booster. According to immunologist Ciriaco Piccirillo, antibody levels tend to decay after four to six months, and a fourth dose will boost those levels again. While there is no harm in getting a fourth dose now, individuals should consider their own risk factors and consult a doctor. Michael Grant, a professor of immunology, adds that a prior COVID-19 infection should also be considered as it can provide equivalent or even better immunity than one dose of a vaccine. There is limited data on the effectiveness of a fourth dose, with conflicting study results from Israel. The current booster shots are based on the original Wuhan strain, and there are questions about their effectiveness against new variants like Omicron. Pfizer and Moderna are developing updated vaccines targeted at Omicron and its sub-lineages, which are expected to be ready in the fall. Individuals may consider waiting for these updated vaccines, depending on their personal risk factors. According to Piccirillo and other experts, the general healthy population can likely wait until the fall for whichever booster is available, as the protection offered by the first booster is still significant, especially with low transmission rates during the summer months.

Title: COVID in Babies and Kids: Symptoms and Prevention
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: True

COVID-19 symptoms in children can include cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea, congestion, and a runny nose. While COVID-19 symptoms tend to be milder in children compared to adults, serious illness and hospitalization can still occur, and children can transmit the virus to others. Therefore, it is important to take precautions such as mask-wearing, handwashing, physical distancing, and getting vaccinated to prevent infection in children as well as adults. According to the CDC, some children may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization, including those under the age of 2, Black and Latino children due to health disparities, children born prematurely, and those living with obesity or chronic lung disease. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that can occur after a coronavirus infection, characterized by fever and other symptoms such as unusual weakness, a red rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes, and swollen hands or feet. To reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and its consequences, parents and guardians should ensure that all family members receive COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters as soon as they are eligible, know the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, practice good hand hygiene, encourage coughing and sneezing into elbows, remind children to avoid touching their faces, regularly clean frequently touched surfaces, and address anxiety and stress related to the pandemic.

Title: Expert: Canadians seeking closure are finally holding funerals delayed by COVID-19
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True

Here is a summary of the article and additional information provided: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted funeral practices and mourning processes in Canada. While some families feel ready to hold funerals and memorial services, others feel too much time has passed, and their mourning has already taken place without these traditional rituals. This has led to a lack of consensus within communities about how and when to mourn. Mary Ellen Macdonald, an associate professor at McGill University, offers expertise on grief and mourning during the pandemic. She argues that the notion of "pausing" or "suspending" grief during the pandemic is misleading. Instead, she explains that while mourning practices have been interrupted, grief itself is ongoing and constant. Macdonald emphasizes that grief does not follow a linear timeline or stages and that delaying a funeral does not put grief on hold. She suggests that such ideas reproduce unhelpful messages and stigma surrounding grief. Macdonald, a medical anthropologist with expertise in pediatric palliative care and cultural aspects of health and illness, provides valuable insights into the complex nature of grief during the COVID-19 era. Her research interests encompass oral health in vulnerable populations, palliative care, and bereavement, offering a unique perspective on the impact of the pandemic on mourning practices.

Title: COVID-19 Rebound after Taking Paxlovid Likely Due to Insufficient Drug Exposure
Publisher: UC San Diego Health
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Paxlovid is an effective oral medication that reduces the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, especially for high-risk individuals. However, some patients experienced a relapse of symptoms after completing the standard 5-day treatment course, a phenomenon known as "COVID-19 rebound." A study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases investigated the potential causes of this rebound. The researchers found that the COVID-19 rebound was not due to the coronavirus developing resistance to Paxlovid or impaired immunity against the virus. Instead, it appears that insufficient exposure to the drug is the likely cause. This could be due to individual variations in drug metabolism or the need for a longer treatment duration. The study highlights the importance of understanding COVID-19 rebound and suggests that physicians may need to adjust treatment plans, such as extending the duration of Paxlovid treatment or combining it with other drugs. While Paxlovid remains effective in preventing severe illness and death, understanding and managing rebound cases can help improve patient care and reduce the risk of further spread. The article also emphasizes the need for further research to determine the frequency of rebound cases, identify susceptible patient populations, and assess the potential for more severe disease following symptom relapse. As COVID-19 continues to evolve, such studies provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and public health officials to make informed decisions and optimize treatment strategies. Overall, this summary highlights the key findings and implications of the study on COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment, offering important considerations for forecasting hospitalizations and refining treatment guidelines.

Title: COVID-19: Respiratory or Vascular Disease?
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the vascular system and its potential for causing strokes in hospitalized patients with severe cases. While COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, its effects on the vascular system are significant enough that researchers questioned if it should be considered a vascular disease. The latest research suggests that the vascular symptoms are a result of inflammation. Understanding the vascular complications helps doctors treat and manage these symptoms, such as through the use of blood thinners. Additionally, recognizing COVID-19's impact on the vascular system can aid in identifying high-risk patients and improving their outcomes. Here are some key points to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: COVID-19 can cause serious organ damage, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, and heart. The lungs are the organs most commonly affected by COVID-19, with symptoms ranging from irritation and inflammation to fluid buildup and potential long-term damage. People who have recovered from severe COVID-19 are at an increased risk of heart complications, suggesting a strong link between the virus and heart health. Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions are at a higher risk of developing more severe symptoms if they contract COVID-19. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of vascular complications, including strokes. Understanding the vascular impact of COVID-19 can help identify those at highest risk and lead to more targeted treatments and improved outcomes. Doctors may use strategies to manage inflammation while treating COVID-19, such as administering blood thinners to at-risk patients to lower the risk of stroke and other vascular complications. By considering these factors and monitoring the occurrence of severe cases and hospitalizations, forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations can be made and adjusted accordingly as new information arises.

The article discusses how many families in Canada are planning belated memorial services for their loved ones who passed away during the COVID-19 pandemic, as gathering limits and travel restrictions left them unable to hold proper funerals or gatherings. Funeral directors note that the grief experienced by these families is no less painful now than it was at the time of death, and that the inability to hold timely and fitting funerals has made it harder for people to move forward in their grief. However, holding some form of in-person remembrance event, however belated, can help with the healing process. The article also provides suggestions for planning belated memorials, such as choosing a significant date and using digital invitation and RSVP services. Additionally, an end-of-life care expert emphasizes the importance of celebrating the life of the deceased in a way that feels authentic, regardless of the time that has passed.
