Here is a summary of the article: Google and Apple are joining forces to create contact tracing technology to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic and slow its spread. The plan is to use Bluetooth technology and will be implemented in two steps. The first step, in May, involves releasing APIs for Android and iOS devices to enable interoperability with apps from public health authorities. The second step involves building a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform into the underlying operating systems, allowing for more participation and interaction with various apps and health authorities. This technology prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and consent. The companies believe this collaboration will help countries slow the spread of COVID-19 and return to normalcy. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, while the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction, the development of this contact tracing technology could be a valuable tool in that effort. By identifying and tracing close contacts of infected individuals, health authorities can gain a better understanding of the virus's spread and make more informed decisions about resource allocation and containment strategies, which could, in turn, help in forecasting hospitalizations.

Here is a summary of the interview with Christine Devine, Wellness Specialist at Michael Garron Hospital, along with some key takeaways and advice for healthcare organizations and workers: Context and Challenges for Healthcare Workers: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on healthcare workers, affecting their mental health and well-being. Healthcare workers are facing challenges such as long work hours, exposure to the virus, fear of infecting loved ones, moral distress from difficult decisions, and the psychological toll of caring for critically ill patients. Impact on Mental Health of Staff: The pandemic has caused increased anxiety, fear, and stress among healthcare workers, with concerns about their own health, the health of their colleagues, and the ability to provide quality patient care. Many workers are experiencing moral distress due to limited resources, end-of-life care decisions, and the inability to provide the level of care they feel their patients deserve. Advice for Leaders to Calm Nerves: Open and transparent communication is key. Leaders should provide frequent updates, ensure accessibility, and create safe spaces for staff to voice concerns. Emphasize the importance of self-care and encourage staff to take breaks, practice grounding techniques, and access mental health resources. Recognize and acknowledge the efforts of healthcare workers to boost morale and show support. Impact of Leadership Steps: Providing clear and consistent communication, along with access to support services, has helped reduce anxiety and fear among staff. Recognizing the impact of moral distress and providing resources to manage it has been crucial in supporting the mental health of healthcare workers. Self-Care Tips for Healthcare Workers: Prioritize self-care and practice good sleep hygiene, healthy eating, and regular exercise. Set boundaries and practice saying "no" when needed to prevent burnout. Access mental health resources, such as counseling services or peer support programs. Practice mindfulness and grounding techniques to manage stress and anxiety. Protecting Mental Health of Hospital Staff: Offer a range of mental health resources, including counseling, peer support, and psychological services. Create dedicated spaces for staff to relax and recharge during shifts. Provide access to virtual support groups and online mental health resources. Encourage peer-to-peer support and ensure a culture of safety and openness. Healing After COVID-19: The healing process will be unique for each individual, and organizations should offer ongoing support and resources. It is important to recognize and address the cumulative toll of the pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health. Off-the-Job Mental Health Support: For healthcare workers with families, provide resources and support for managing work-life balance and caring for dependents. Encourage single or isolated workers to connect virtually with colleagues and access online support groups. Advice for Healthcare Workers with Families and Aging Parents: Prioritize self-care and practice stress management techniques to stay resilient. Access support services, such as elder care resources or counseling, to help manage additional responsibilities. Stay connected with family and friends, and seek help when needed. National Standard of Canada on Psychological Health and Safety: The adoption of the National Standard has helped the hospital to prioritize and focus on the mental health of its workers during the pandemic. It has provided a framework to guide the development and implementation of psychological health and safety policies and programs. Leadership Team Focus: The leadership team is committed to supporting staff through consistent communication, recognition, and access to resources. They emphasize the importance of self-care and provide tools to help manage stress and anxiety. Tools for Managing the Pandemic: The hospital utilizes various tools and resources, including virtual support groups, online counseling services, peer support programs, and mindfulness apps. They also provide access to the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace to ensure a comprehensive approach to mental health support. Key takeaway: Protecting the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a multi-faceted approach, including open communication, access to resources, peer support, and a focus on self-care and resilience.

Title: Lockdown is the world's biggest psychological experiment - and we will pay the price
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdowns for approximately one-third of the world's population, impacting their mental health. Research shows that people in quarantine often experience psychological distress, including low mood, insomnia, stress, anxiety, and irritability. These mental health issues can lead to long-term absenteeism and reduced productivity in the workforce. The mental toll of the pandemic is expected to result in a secondary epidemic of burnouts and stress-related absences in the latter half of 2020. Healthcare workers, young people, children, the elderly, and those in precarious situations are particularly at risk for long-term mental health issues. To mitigate these effects, governments and NGOs should provide self-help interventions, educate people about the expected psychological impact, launch dedicated websites, and ensure access to psychological help for those in need. Belgium's "Everyone OK" online tool is an example of a digital self-help resource that can offer support during this challenging time.

Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered consumer behavior in Canada, with a shift towards stocking up on essential items and social distancing. In the week following the federal government's announcement of its COVID-19 response fund and economic relief package, grocery sales surged by 38% compared to the average sales in 2019. This trend was characterized by a sharp increase in the demand for personal care and household cleaning products, particularly hand sanitizers (639% increase) and masks and gloves (377% increase). Bathroom tissue sales also experienced a significant boost, peaking at a 241% increase relative to the 2019 average in the week ending March 14th, despite reassurances about supply availability. Canadians prioritized dry goods and shelf-stable foods, with sales of rice, pasta, canned vegetables, and flour surging by over 150% to 200% compared to the 2019 average. While sales of fresh produce and meat also increased, the magnitude was relatively smaller, indicating a focus on stockpiling non-perishables. This study highlights the rapid change in consumer behavior and purchasing patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underscores the importance of data analysis in understanding these shifts and their potential impact on supply chains and the economy. The article concludes by mentioning ongoing efforts to update the study and address concerns about price-gouging, with retailers committing to avoiding predatory practices. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, certain factors such as infection rates, demographics, and healthcare system capacity would need to be considered. Infection rates can be influenced by factors like vaccination status, mask mandates, and physical distancing measures. Demographics, including age and underlying health conditions, play a role in determining the severity of the disease and the likelihood of hospitalization. Additionally, the capacity and resources of the healthcare system, such as the number of available hospital beds and ventilators, can impact hospitalization rates.

The Canadian government is taking steps to support workers, businesses, and citizens affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially young people facing challenges in finding employment. To address this, the government has announced temporary changes to the Canada Summer Jobs program, which will help create 70,000 jobs for youth between 15 and 30. The changes include increasing the wage subsidy for employers, extending the end date for employment to February 28, 2021, allowing job activity adaptations, and permitting part-time hiring. These steps will help youth maintain connections to the job market and find safe, healthy work environments. This builds on previous actions taken by the government to support young Canadians during the crisis, including a moratorium on student loan interest and a wage subsidy for businesses. The government plans to further support students and young people as the pandemic continues. The Canada Summer Jobs program provides opportunities for youth to develop skills and support community services, and the government is adapting it to ensure resources are available to deal with the impacts of COVID-19.

Title: Why B.C. is flattening the COVID-19 curve while numbers in central Canada surge
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Canada's two largest provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are currently experiencing a more severe COVID-19 outbreak than British Columbia (B.C.). While the virus has steadily grown in Ontario and Quebec, B.C. has managed to keep hospitalizations and active cases relatively flat over the last week. Experts attribute B.C.'s success to several factors, including early preparation and unified communication. B.C.'s institutions for disease control have long been a model for the country, and the province was able to quickly scale up a unified response. The timing of spring break also played a role, as B.C.'s break was later than in other jurisdictions, allowing health officials to adapt. Another crucial factor is the leadership of B.C.'s chief medical health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, who has been praised for her frank and honest communication with the public. Henry's direct experience in overseeing previous outbreaks has also been crucial in flattening the curve. While Ontario has also taken steps to address the outbreak, experts believe it has lagged behind B.C. in its response. Overall, a combination of preparation, leadership, and timing has contributed to B.C.'s success in managing the COVID-19 outbreak.

Title: How Vietnam is Winning its War Against COVID-19
Publisher: Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
As of April 6, 2020, Vietnam had reported only 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 95 recoveries, and zero deaths, making it one of the few countries seemingly successful in containing the pandemic. Vietnam's quick and proactive response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, due to its close proximity and economic ties, likely contributed significantly to its success. The country implemented strict contact tracing, monitoring, and quarantine measures, which included the suspension of schools and the isolation of affected neighborhoods and communes. Technology played a key role in Vietnam's response, with the development of online reporting systems and mobile apps for contact tracing and monitoring. The NCOVI app, introduced by the Ministry of Information and Communications, allowed citizens to proactively report their health status, while the SmartCity app tracked infected, quarantined, and recovered cases. These measures were generally well-received by the public, with 62% expressing satisfaction. However, Vietnam's approach also raises concerns about data privacy and mass surveillance. There have been instances of patient identities being leaked on social media, highlighting the need for improved data protection regulations. Nonetheless, Vietnam's experience offers valuable lessons for other countries, including Canada, particularly in the effective use of technology for contact tracing and the importance of caution to prevent public disclosure of personal information during a pandemic.

Dr. Jeanna Parsons Leigh, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Health, has received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to study the socio-cultural implications of the COVID-19 outbreak in Canada. The focus of her research is to understand where Canadians are getting their information about COVID-19, whether the information is accurate, and the resulting behavioral changes. The project, "Socio-Cultural Implications of COVID-19: Educating, Engaging and Empowering the Public," aims to educate and empower individuals to be informed about their health regarding the outbreak. Dr. Parsons Leigh's work is especially important given the impact of misinformation during the pandemic. By understanding information sources and their influence on perceptions and behaviors across different demographic groups, effective strategies can be developed to reach and inform the public. Since receiving the CIHR funding, Dr. Parsons Leigh and her team have made significant progress, including developing a national knowledge translation (KT) campaign and collaborating with researchers from various universities and organizations. Their work will have valuable insights for public health communication and COVID-19 response.
