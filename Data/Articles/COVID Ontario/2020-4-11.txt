This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the COVID-19 models released by Alberta, which contain several scenarios, including a "probable" scenario that forecasted roughly 200 people would be in hospital with the disease by April 8. However, the actual number of hospitalizations in Alberta was significantly lower, with fewer than 50 patients hospitalized by that date. The article highlights the differences in hospitalization rates between Alberta and other provinces, including Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. The article suggests that the low hospitalization rates in Alberta may be due to various factors, including the province's testing and contact-tracing protocols, the age of its population, and the geographic distribution of its citizens. However, scientific experts caution that more data is needed before drawing firm conclusions about what's happening with COVID-19 in the province. The article provides the following values that are most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Hospitalization rates in Alberta: 44 people in hospital, including 16 in intensive-care units (as of the article's publication date) Comparison of hospitalization rates between Alberta and other provinces: + Ontario: over 600 patients in hospital + Quebec: over 600 patients in hospital + British Columbia: 135 hospitalized patients, including 61 in ICU Testing and contact-tracing protocols in Alberta Age of the population in Alberta (youngest population in Canada) Geographic distribution of citizens in Alberta (more spread out than other provinces) These values can be used to inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, and to consider the potential factors that may influence hospitalization rates in the province.

TRUE. The article provides relevant information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the values most important for forecasting: Ontario's forecast predicts 1,600 deaths from COVID-19 by April 30 with current physical distancing measures in place. Without any measures, 6,000 people could have been dead by the end of the month. The model forecasts 80,000 cases of COVID-19 in Ontario by April 30. Without current health measures, there would be 300,000 cases by the end of the month. The pandemic could last between 18 months and two years with 3,000 to 15,000 deaths in Ontario with current health measures. Without any public health measures, the worst-case scenario forecasts up to 100,000 deaths in Ontario. These values provide insight into the potential scale and timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, which can inform forecasting of hospitalizations.

The province has confirmed 309 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 4,347, with 132 deaths (although CBC News has counted 150 deaths province-wide). The test backlog has dropped to 329, but infectious disease experts are critical of Ontario's testing capacity, which is the lowest per capita in Canada. The province is aiming to complete more than 5,000 tests per day in the near future. Currently, 589 people are hospitalized with COVID-19, 216 are in intensive care units, and 160 are on ventilators.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: British Columbia's (BC) COVID-19 outbreak is less severe than Ontario's, with flat hospitalizations and active cases over the last week. BC's success is attributed to a combination of luck, preparation, and effective public health leadership, including Dr. Bonnie Henry's experience and communication style. Ontario's response was slower, with difficulties in public health leadership culture and a less unified response. Key factors contributing to BC's success include: + Early measures to stop health-care workers from working at multiple care homes. + A functioning public health system with integration of lab and epidemiology and service. + Effective communication and leadership from Dr. Bonnie Henry. + A later spring break, allowing health officials to adapt and respond to the outbreak. Ontario's challenges include: + A less unified response and messaging to the public. + A lack of public health leadership and expertise, relying on advice from others. These factors can inform forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, by highlighting the importance of effective public health leadership, communication, and preparedness in responding to the outbreak.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The current number of ICU beds equipped with ventilators in Ontario is 1,971, which is a 50% increase from March. The number of people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 589, with 216 in ICUs and 160 on ventilators. Modelling suggests that Ontario will need to add an extra 900 intensive care beds to cope with a projected steep rise in COVID-19 patients over the next two weeks. The peak demand for ICU beds is forecast to hit hospitals between April 16 and 20, with as many as 1,200 cases of COVID-19 in the ICUs. The province is allowing hospitals to expand intensive care bed capacity, but it is unclear how they will find the necessary staff. The province is recruiting retired nurses, medical students, and other volunteers to help staff overstretched hospital departments. An additional 652 ventilators are now in place, and more are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. These values provide important information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, including the current capacity of ICU beds, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the projected demand for ICU beds in the coming weeks.
