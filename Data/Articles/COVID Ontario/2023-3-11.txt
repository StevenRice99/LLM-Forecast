Title: Three years later: What has COVID-19 taught us and are we ready for the next big threat?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article reflects on the three years since the COVID-19 pandemic began and explores the lessons learned and how they can be applied to future pandemics. Here are the key points: Respiratory pandemics like COVID-19 occur every 10 to 20 years, and more frequent respiratory pandemics are possible, according to Dr. Nicholas Christakis. He believes we are currently in the second phase of the pandemic, where the threat has receded due to vaccination and infection-induced immunity. Scientific and medical advancements during the pandemic include the rapid development of effective vaccines and public health interventions such as masking, gathering limits, and social distancing, which helped reduce COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Alberta's healthcare system had to pivot, with hospitals redeploying staff, canceling surgeries, and setting up field hospitals to accommodate COVID-19 patients. The system also adapted by integrating primary care with central healthcare and improving data sharing. However, misinformation and shifting scientific recommendations have led to distrust in institutions and polarization among the population. Timothy Caulfield worries that this will make it difficult for governments to implement necessary health measures in the future. The pandemic has amplified socio-economic divisions, with a "substantial minority" losing trust in government leaders and their fellow citizens, according to sociologist Alex Bierman. This could make it challenging to get people to follow health policies and get vaccinated in the future. Despite the challenges, the majority of Albertans received their initial COVID-19 vaccinations, showing a level of trust in the healthcare system. Myles Leslie believes that we are "not so broken" and have learned to negotiate, extend relationships, and become more equitable and empathetic. COVID-19 has had devastating consequences, but it could have been worse. The "Spanish flu" of 1918 killed far more people, and Christakis attributes the political arguments surrounding COVID-19 to the virus being deadly enough to be taken seriously but not deadly enough to elicit unanimous agreement on the necessary actions. The article concludes by acknowledging the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19 and expressing hope that the lessons learned will enable us to better handle future pandemics.

Title: Covid-19 World Map: Cases, Deaths and Global Trends
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
As of March 10, global data on COVID-19 cases and deaths is no longer reported for countries other than the United States, impacting forecasting abilities. The available information includes daily case numbers, vaccination data, and all-time charts from January 21, 2020, to the present. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University provides data for all countries except the US, which collects its data through state and local health officials. The current boosters target the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which are no longer the dominant strains. China reported a surge in hospitalizations and deaths on January 12, 2023, and the US also saw a one-day increase in total deaths on November 11, 2022, due to the inclusion of CDC-reconciled death certificate data. It is important to note that confirmed cases and deaths are considered an undercount, and governments may revise data or report anomalies, impacting the accuracy of seven-day averages. The New York Times employs adjustment methods to mitigate these irregularities.

Title: Research to Insights: A look at Canada’s economy and society three years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada is still facing its impacts with over 51,000 deaths, despite 97 million vaccination doses administered. The Omicron wave marked a turning point, with most restrictions eased and life returning to a "new normal." Canada's GDP growth has outpaced other G7 countries since Q2 2021, but higher financing costs have impacted sensitive sectors like real estate. Business entry has slowed since the summer of 2022, with closures outpacing openings due to rising inflation and labor-related obstacles. Employment has strengthened, with private sector jobs increasing. Total employment in January 2023 was 800,000 above pre-COVID-19 levels, and all net gains were in full-time work. Labor market conditions remain tight, with vacancies moderating but still elevated. Health care and social assistance vacancies are trending higher. Demographic trends show that one in five working-age Canadians is set to retire soon, and population aging will impact labor force growth. Immigration has accounted for nearly 90% of Canada's population growth since 2020, but many newcomers' skills are underutilized, and they face housing challenges in large cities. Housing affordability has deteriorated with rising debt levels, and the Bank of Canada's housing affordability index is at its highest since 1990. Mortgage interest costs have risen 18% in the last year, contributing to inflationary pressure. The COVID-19 pandemic has had interrelated impacts on the economy and society, with challenges in housing, healthcare, and social cohesion. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction. However, it mentions that national transmission indicators and outbreak incidence remain stable as of the article's publication date. The social impacts of the pandemic, particularly mental health challenges and substance abuse among younger Canadians, may take longer to ease. Overall, Canada's economy and society continue to adjust and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are still challenges and uncertainties ahead.

Title: World’s most comprehensive study on COVID-19 mental health
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article summarizes a study published in the BMJ by a team of researchers from McGill University and other institutions, which found that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a relatively limited impact on the mental health of most people globally. The researchers reviewed 137 studies in various languages, involving 134 cohorts from across the world, and found that any changes in mental health symptoms compared to pre-pandemic levels were minimal for most people, including specific groups such as those of different ages, sexes, or with pre-existing health conditions. The study also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on the mental health of some women, possibly due to increased family responsibilities, work in healthcare or elder care, or family violence. The findings suggest that most people have been resilient during the pandemic, but some groups may need ongoing access to mental health support. The researchers emphasize the need for rigorous science and better-quality, timely mental health data to inform targeted mental health resource allocation. The study, "Comparison of mental health symptoms before and during the covid-19 pandemic: evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis of 134 cohorts," provides important insights into the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and has implications for forecasting hospitalizations by identifying at-risk groups and allocating resources accordingly.

Title: After three years of COVID-19, surveillance and vaccination key to ending pandemic in the Americas
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has entered its third year in the Americas, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, has urged countries to enhance their surveillance and vaccination efforts to end the emergency and better prepare for future health crises. The Americas accounted for a significant proportion of global COVID-19 cases and deaths, with over 190.3 million cases and 2.9 million deaths. Dr. Barbosa acknowledged that the pandemic exposed the lack of preparedness worldwide, including in the Americas, a region with significant inequities. While incidence rates have decreased significantly compared to the previous year, he cautioned that COVID-19 is still a concern and the virus' behavior remains unpredictable. PAHO played a crucial role in strengthening the COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Regional Network, which tracks virus evolution and monitors other potential pandemic pathogens. They also facilitated the distribution of over 160 million vaccine doses through COVAX and supported countries in administering more than 1.3 billion vaccine doses. Despite progress, Dr. Barbosa warned against complacency as COVID-19 continues to circulate, with over 1.5 million new cases and 17,000 deaths in the last month. He emphasized the importance of maintaining surveillance and addressing gaps in vaccination coverage, particularly for the 30% of people who have not received their primary series, to prepare for potential new waves or variants. The pandemic has exposed weaknesses in health systems, impacting the detection and treatment of diseases like TB and HIV, as well as routine vaccination rates. Dr. Barbosa emphasized the opportunity to prioritize health in the Sustainable Development Agenda and focus on resilient health systems that serve everyone and are prepared for future health threats. As he begins his tenure, Dr. Barbosa reaffirmed PAHO's commitment to supporting countries in the Americas in learning from and applying the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key facts to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Surveillance and early warning systems: Strengthening surveillance and monitoring systems can help detect changes in virus behavior, incidence rates, and the emergence of new variants, providing data for more accurate hospitalization forecasts. Vaccination coverage: Vaccination remains a critical tool in reducing severe disease and hospitalizations. Focusing on increasing primary series coverage and boosting vulnerable populations can help reduce the strain on healthcare systems. Healthcare system capacity: Assessing the capacity and resilience of healthcare systems, including staffing, ICU beds, and ventilation support, is essential for understanding the ability to manage a surge in hospitalizations. Virus behavior and variants: The unpredictable nature of the virus and the potential emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility or immune escape capabilities can significantly impact hospitalization rates. Seasonal factors: COVID-19 hospitalizations may exhibit seasonal variations, with potential increases during winter months or periods of indoor gatherings. Health system weaknesses: Addressing weaknesses in health systems, such as improving detection and treatment of other diseases, can help prevent additional strain on healthcare resources and improve overall resilience. Preparedness and response plans: Countries' preparedness and response plans, including their ability to implement public health measures and communicate risks effectively, can influence the trajectory of hospitalizations. Global collaboration and data sharing: Continued global collaboration through initiatives like the PAHO and timely data sharing can provide insights into hospitalization trends and support more accurate forecasting.

Title: Suicide attempts rose among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for girls
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the mental health of children and adolescents, with a 25% reported rate of significant depression and a 60% increase in hospitalization for eating disorders. Screen time increased by 50%, physical activity decreased by 20%, and there were also increases in loneliness, family violence, and parental mental health issues. A research study published in Lancet Psychiatry analyzed 11.1 million children's emergency department visits in 18 countries and found a 22% increase in suicide attempts during the pandemic, with a 39% increase for girls and a 6% increase for boys. The pandemic stressors, such as school closures and social distancing, limited access to protective supports, and the gender differences in suicidal behavior, have contributed to a mental health crisis that requires immediate attention and prevention strategies from governments and policymakers. Early intervention and accessible mental health care are crucial to fostering the well-being of children and adolescents.

Title: Long-term gastrointestinal outcomes of COVID-19
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This study aimed to investigate the association between COVID-19 and various gastrointestinal outcomes during the post-acute phase of the disease. The study utilized data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs' electronic healthcare databases, focusing on veterans who received a positive COVID-19 test result between March 1st, 2020, and January 15th, 2021, and comparing them to both contemporary and historical control groups. The study followed participants for the occurrence of gastrointestinal outcomes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatitis during the post-acute phase of COVID-19, defined as 30 days after the initial positive test. The key findings of the study include: The COVID-19 cohort had an increased risk of developing GERD (hazard ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.47), gastrointestinal bleeding (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.68), and pancreatitis (hazard ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.65 to 3.05) compared to the contemporary control group. Similar associations were observed when comparing the COVID-19 cohort to the historical control group, with increased risks of GERD (hazard ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.46), gastrointestinal bleeding (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.62), and pancreatitis (hazard ratio 2.16, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.86). The risks of these gastrointestinal outcomes were highest among individuals who required intensive care during the acute phase of COVID-19. Individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to those hospitalized with seasonal influenza. The study concludes that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of several gastrointestinal outcomes during the post-acute phase of the disease, and these risks are elevated compared to both contemporary and historical control groups. The findings suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms may persist or emerge after the initial infection, highlighting the need for continued monitoring and care for COVID-19 survivors.
