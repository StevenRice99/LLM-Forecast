2. Vaccination status affects hospitalization and death: Unvaccinated individuals represent 80% of hospitalizations and nearly 90% of ICU patients, highlighting the importance of vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.
3. Healthcare workers are frustrated and burnt out: Healthcare professionals are experiencing high levels of fatigue, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion due to the ongoing pandemic.

Title: Ontario’s new COVID-19 cases could drop to 200 a day — or rise to 5,000, latest modelling projects – Winnipeg Free Press

Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
The Delta variant can spread quickly if transmission increases by 25%, leading to up to 5,000 new cases per day.
The number of new daily infections could range from 200 (best-case scenario) to 1,500 (if no policy or behavior changes are made).
Continued control over case growth requires high vaccination rates in the eligible population and continued public health measures.
