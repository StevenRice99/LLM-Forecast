Title: ‘Immunity debt’: Why experts say this new term promotes COVID-19 ‘misinformation’ - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The term "immunity debt" has gained traction online as a supposed explanation for the recent surge in respiratory illnesses in Canada, but experts in infectious diseases caution against this idea, calling it "dangerous" and a potential source of COVID-19 "misinformation." Two main interpretations of "immunity debt" have emerged. The first suggests that people's immune systems have weakened due to reduced virus exposure during the pandemic, an idea refuted by experts who compare the immune system to a collection of photographs that doesn't fade with lack of use. Age, not lack of exposure, is the primary factor in immune system effectiveness. The second interpretation of "immunity debt" blames delayed exposure to respiratory viruses due to lockdowns and masks for the current surge in pediatric hospitalizations. While there may be some truth to this, it doesn't fully explain the severity of illnesses seen in children. Emerging evidence indicates that COVID-19 may be responsible for harming the immune system, but the extent and long-term effects are still unknown. Experts emphasize the danger of blaming public health measures for the respiratory illness surge, as it discourages their use when they are still crucial in combating the pandemic. The term "immunity debt" and the associated narratives have the potential to fuel COVID-19 misinformation and create resistance to necessary public health measures.

Title: Depression After Covid: Symptoms to Watch for and How to Treat It
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health worldwide, with a 25% increase in anxiety and depression in the first year. A 2021 study found that over half of American adults experienced symptoms of major depressive disorder after a COVID-19 infection, and the risk of these symptoms and other mental health disorders remains elevated for up to a year after recovery. The pandemic caused distress due to health worries, grief, social isolation, and disrupted daily activities. Those who contracted COVID-19 appear more susceptible to various mental health issues compared to those who did not get infected, suggesting that the virus particularly affects the brain. Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist, emphasizes the unique impact of the coronavirus on neurological and psychiatric conditions. These findings highlight the importance of addressing mental health in COVID-19 recovery and preparedness for future public health crises.

Title: Global leishmaniasis surveillance: 2021, assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some key facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article provides an overview of leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in four eco-epidemiological regions: the Americas, East Africa, North Africa, and West and Southeast Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published global reports on leishmaniasis surveillance, with the latest one being the fourth update. Six indicators of leishmaniasis are available to the public through the Global Health Observatory (GHO), and more detailed country profiles with up to 30 indicators are also published. The report aims to provide updated results for the GHO leishmaniasis indicators up to 2021, including data on gender and age distribution, relapses, and treatment programs. It also includes information on specific topics such as outbreaks, case fatality rates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), co-infections with HIV, and the burden of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The Kala-azar Elimination Programme in South-East Asia and adverse events following the administration of anti-leishmanial drugs are also discussed. While the article does not directly mention COVID-19 hospitalizations, some of the indicators and surveillance data it discusses could provide insights into healthcare capacity and resources in the affected regions. For example: The availability of detailed country profiles with up to 30 indicators can help identify regions with weaker healthcare infrastructure, which might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 hospitalizations. Information on case fatality rates for VL and co-infections with HIV could provide insights into the overall healthcare capacity and the ability to manage complex cases, which could indirectly impact COVID-19 hospitalizations. The discussion of treatment programs and drug administration could indicate the availability of healthcare resources and their potential diversion during the COVID-19 pandemic, influencing hospitalization rates. Overall, while this article focuses on leishmaniasis, the surveillance data and indicators it presents could provide valuable context for understanding the healthcare landscape in the affected regions and indirectly contribute to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Toronto's homeless community shares stories of struggles experienced during COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada, faced numerous challenges, and often felt let down by the systems meant to support them. They came together to form communities in parks, providing mutual aid and comfort, but often faced police violence and intimidation. The pandemic also took a toll on frontline workers, who struggled to keep programs and services running with reduced resources and funding cuts. Advocacy groups played a crucial role in fighting for the rights and safety of vulnerable populations, including legal battles to ensure safer shelters and the right to camp in parks. Diana Chan McNally, who worked for the Toronto Drop-In Network, coordinated life-saving services and advocated for access to vaccines and personal protective equipment. The city also took some measures, such as distributing N95 masks to shelter clients and setting up a pilot vaccine program. The pandemic exacerbated existing issues, such as the drug poisoning crisis, with many people losing their lives in shelters that lacked supervised consumption sites. Indigenous peoples and individuals with disabilities were disproportionately impacted, facing additional barriers and challenges. The book "Displacement City: Fighting for Health and Homes in a Pandemic" compiles firsthand accounts and stories of survival from this time, offering a different narrative from the official city version. It aims to give voice to those who fought for the vulnerable and to expose the inequities and shortcomings of the system. Moving forward, Toronto has set goals to approve more affordable rental homes and supportive housing as part of its HousingTO 2020-2030 Action Plan.

Title: Acute and postacute sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This study aimed to assess the risks and burden of health outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared to no reinfection and a noninfected control group. The study utilized data from the US Veterans Health Administration electronic health database, including 443,588 participants with no reinfection, 40,947 with reinfection, and 5,334,729 noninfected controls. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and various organ system disorders. The study found that participants with reinfection had a higher risk of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and developing at least one sequela compared to those without reinfection. The excess burden of these outcomes per 1,000 participants at 6 months after reinfection was 16.07 (95% CI 11.52–20.61) for all-cause mortality, 48.21 (95% CI 44.01–52.41) for hospitalization, and 115.26 (95% CI 111.83–118.68) for having at least one sequela. The risk of hospitalization was higher among those with a shorter duration between infections, suggesting that recent prior infection may provide some protection against severe disease. Additionally, the study examined the risk and cumulative burden of sequelae associated with one, two, or three or more infections compared to noninfected controls. The risk of hospitalization was higher with an increasing number of infections, with an HR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.22–1.33) for one infection, 1.59 (95% CI 1.45–1.74) for two infections, and 1.78 (95% CI 1.54–2.06) for three or more infections compared to noninfected controls. The excess burden of hospitalization per 1,000 persons at one year after the first infection was 22.68 (95% CI 20.56–24.80) for one infection, 50.27 (95% CI 42.61–57.94) for two infections, and 61.55 (95% CI 49.66–73.44) for three or more infections. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes compared to no reinfection and noninfected controls. The risk of hospitalization is higher with a shorter duration between infections and an increasing number of infections. These findings highlight the importance of preventing reinfections to reduce the burden of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

Title: Quiet quitting has increased since COVID-19, say HR leaders
Publisher: HRD Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Quiet quitting, or employees reducing their workload without formally changing their job roles, has become more prevalent since the COVID-19 pandemic, with 70% of employers and HR leaders noticing a spike. This trend is attributed to a challenging year for both employers and employees, with feelings of abandonment and burnout. While some attribute quiet quitting to the trauma response of a global crisis, others view it as employees taking advantage of reduced oversight. This phenomenon could impact productivity and contribute to a decline in overall output. As COVID-19 continues to impact workplaces, forecasting hospitalizations may become more complex, especially if worker output is affected.

The University of Manitoba's COVID-19 update for November 9, 2022, includes information on the return to in-person classes and events, health and safety protocols, and COVID-19 reporting. Here is a summary: In-Person Classes and Events: The university has returned to in-person classes and events, with no approvals required through the COVID-19 Recovery Steering Committee. Masking: The existing masking mandate requires the use of masks indoors, with KN95 masks highly recommended. Proper fitting of masks is emphasized for maximum effectiveness. Instructors can remove their masks while actively teaching if they are approximately 2 meters away from others. Masks are not required outdoors. Health and Safety Protocols: The university advises following self-isolation protocols and staying home when sick to protect the community. COVID-19 Reporting: UM will no longer collect or report COVID-19 cases on campus. Individuals who test positive must follow Manitoba Public Health directives and refrain from coming to the university until safe to do so. Reporting to the university is not required, but students should contact their instructors or supervisors regarding their absence. COVID-19 Booster Shots: All adults aged 18 and older are eligible for a booster shot (third dose), and it is strongly recommended to receive it as soon as eligible. The first booster dose can be administered at least four months after the last dose of the primary series. Some high-risk individuals may also be eligible for a second booster dose. Vaccination Information and Locations: The Manitoba COVID-19 Vaccine Shot Finder helps individuals find vaccination locations, including 28 clinics/pharmacies within a 5-km radius of the William Norrie Centre. University Health Service offers both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines by appointment. Indoor Air Quality Testing: UM has conducted Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) testing in a representative sample of learning spaces on the Fort Garry and Bannatyne campuses, and the full report is available. Sport and Recreation Facilities: Recreation Services and sport and recreation facilities are open at full capacity. Masking is required when moving between equipment/activities, but individuals can remove masks during physical activity. Research and Travel: Research activities no longer require approval, and university-related travel no longer needs Dean authorization regarding COVID considerations. However, pre-COVID permissions and processes remain in place, and travelers should budget for potential delays due to positive COVID tests. Campus Businesses and Services: Standardized building hours are implemented across the Fort Garry campus, and the status of campus businesses, libraries, recreation facilities, and dining spaces can be checked online. The update emphasizes the university's focus on health and safety protocols while returning to in-person activities. The discontinuation of COVID-19 case reporting and the emphasis on individual responsibility for following public health directives and reporting absences indicate a shift in the university's COVID-19 management strategy.

Title: Homeschool enrollment doubled in Canada during COVID-19 lockdowns
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the rise of homeschooling in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic and provides some insights into how it may have impacted parents, especially mothers. Here is a summary along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: During the 2020-2021 academic year, homeschooling in Canada more than doubled, with 83,784 students enrolled compared to 40,608 the previous year, though it remained the least common type of schooling. The increase was observed across almost all grades, particularly in grades 1 and 2. In 2020/2021, there was an overall decrease of 0.7% in enrollments in Canadian elementary and secondary education programs compared to the previous year, with a more significant decline at the junior kindergarten and kindergarten levels. The shift to remote learning during the pandemic may have posed challenges for younger students following an online curriculum. A significant number of parents, especially mothers, had to work from home and take on the additional responsibility of homeschooling, which could put them at risk of increased life stress and potential mental health issues. According to Statistics Canada, the population of children between 4 and 17 years of age increased by 0.9% from July 2019 to July 2020. This could have implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as more children are susceptible to the virus. The article also provides links to tools and resources for further exploring data on enrollments and internet usage during the pandemic, which may be useful for understanding the broader impact on society. While the article focuses on the educational impact and resulting stress on parents, the increase in homeschooling and the corresponding decrease in school enrollments could have a potential impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. With more children being homeschooled and potentially having reduced social interactions, there may be a lower risk of virus transmission within this group. This could lead to a decrease in pediatric hospitalizations related to COVID-19. However, it is important to consider that homeschooling is still a small proportion of overall enrollments, and the impact may be limited. Additionally, the mental health consequences of increased parental stress could indirectly influence hospitalization rates, though this would be challenging to predict and would likely have a longer-term effect.
