Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Moderna is developing a three-in-one vaccine against COVID-19, flu, and RSV, but has not released safety and efficacy data from clinical trials. Experts are cautious about the vaccine's potential, citing the need for solid data and concerns about the complexity of updating the formulation annually. The article mentions the current surge in pediatric RSV cases, stubbornly high COVID hospitalizations and deaths, and steeply rising flu cases in Canada. The Ontario Medical Association is urging people to wear masks indoors and get their flu and COVID-19 shots to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The current surge in pediatric RSV cases and its potential impact on hospitalizations. The stubbornly high COVID hospitalizations and deaths in Canada. The steeply rising flu cases and their potential impact on hospitalizations. The low COVID vaccine uptake in the past 6 months, particularly among children under 5. The potential effectiveness of the three-in-one vaccine in reducing hospitalizations, if it is proven safe and effective.

Title: Canada is seeing an early rise in flu cases. Is a 'tidal wave' of infection coming?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Influenza activity is increasing steeply in Canada, with Ontario already surpassing the seasonal threshold of 5% of samples coming back positive. The province's pediatric hospitals are already overflowing with children sick with illnesses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19. Positive test results for COVID-19 are back on the rise, most recently hitting 17%. The early start of the flu season, combined with the circulation of other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, makes the stretch ahead particularly difficult to predict. Hospital teams worry that waves of different viral infections would mean months of strain on Canada's health-care system. Physicians are calling for a return to mask-wearing inside indoor settings to mitigate the spread of viral infections. Getting a vaccine to protect against both flu and COVID-19 is paramount this fall. The added fear is that the flu is roaring back while there's another respiratory virus — SARS-CoV-2 — now in the mix, which could add to increased severe disease cases. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Influenza activity and positivity rates COVID-19 positivity rates RSV and other respiratory virus activity Hospital capacity and wait times Vaccination rates for flu and COVID-19 Public health measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing.

Title: Wear face masks indoors, federal health officials urge Canadians
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article emphasizes the importance of taking precautions to reduce the impact of a fall surge of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV cases on hospitals. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, recommends wearing face masks indoors, getting COVID-19 boosters and flu shots, and maintaining good hand hygiene. The article notes that COVID-19 vaccine uptake among the youngest children is relatively low, at about 6.5%. The article also mentions that emerging Omicron variants BQ.1.1 and BF.7 are gaining ground in Canada. The article highlights the increased strain on emergency departments, particularly in children's hospitals, which are operating at or over 100% occupancy. The article notes that immunity to RSV and other respiratory viruses is low this year among children who weren't exposed during the previous two years due to physical distancing and other public health precautions. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Low COVID-19 vaccine uptake among young children (6.5%) Emerging Omicron variants BQ.1.1 and BF.7 gaining ground in Canada Increased strain on emergency departments, particularly in children's hospitals Low immunity to RSV and other respiratory viruses among children Recommendation to wear face masks indoors, get COVID-19 boosters and flu shots, and maintain good hand hygiene.

Title: RSV is 'no joke,' warns Ontario mom whose preschooler spent 5 days in ICU with the respiratory virus
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the current surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases in the province, which can impact hospital capacity and resource allocation. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include: RSV cases are surging in many parts of Canada, including Ontario. ICUs across Ontario are operating at 120 to 150 per cent capacity, which could impact the ability to accommodate COVID-19 patients. The peak season for RSV is expected to be in January and February, which could coincide with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. The article highlights the importance of monitoring children's symptoms and seeking medical attention if necessary, which could help reduce the number of severe cases and hospitalizations. However, it is essential to note that the article primarily focuses on RSV and not directly on COVID-19. Therefore, while it provides valuable context on the current healthcare situation in Ontario, it may not offer direct insights into COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting.

Title: University of Waterloo to reinforce mask mandate indoors
Publisher: CityNews Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: The University of Waterloo is mandating masks indoors due to increases in local COVID-19 hospitalizations and emerging trends from test positivity and wastewater that suggest increasing levels of COVID in the community. The university's decision is aimed at minimizing disruption to the end-of-term exam season and protecting vulnerable individuals in the community. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, is monitoring COVID-19 indicators, ICU occupancy, and flu activity to determine whether to recommend reinstating mask mandates. Dr. Moore has stated that if COVID-19 starts affecting the ability to reduce the surgical backlog, he would suggest the government make a recommendation on masking in specific indoor settings. The values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, from this article are: Increasing local COVID-19 hospitalizations Emerging trends from test positivity and wastewater suggesting increasing levels of COVID in the community ICU occupancy Flu activity These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations may increase in the near future, and that public health measures such as mask mandates may be necessary to mitigate this trend.

Title: Study shows consistent efficacy of Paxlovid regardless of age, number of vaccinations, comorbidities
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Trusted: False

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the values most important for forecasting: The study found that Paxlovid treatment significantly lowered the risks of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths in Ontario, Canada, during the dominance of the Omicron variant. The study population consisted of 177,545 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, with 8,876 (5%) exposed to Paxlovid and 168,669 (95%) unexposed. Hospitalizations or deaths in the 30 days were lower among Paxlovid-treated patients compared to unexposed patients (2% vs. 4%, 44% relative reduction). The number needed to treat (NNT) value for preventing a single hospital admission or death from severe SARS-CoV-2 infections was 62. The study found considerable variability in risk reductions in absolute terms by strata, with NNT values ranging between 28 for non-vaccinated individuals and 180 for individuals aged below 70 years. The findings suggest that Paxlovid treatment efficacy may have reduced over time, with a potential reduction observed in the latter 2 months of the study. These values can inform forecasting models by providing estimates of the effectiveness of Paxlovid in reducing hospitalizations and deaths, as well as identifying subgroups with varying levels of risk reduction.
