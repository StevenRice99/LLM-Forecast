Title: Moderna is banking on a combined COVID, flu and RSV vaccine. Will it work?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the challenges facing Moderna, a pharmaceutical company, as it attempts to develop a vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in addition to COVID-19 and flu. The company's stock price has dropped by almost 30% since January due to weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and declining COVID-19 vaccine uptake.
According to the article, fewer than one in five Canadians have received a booster or completed an initial COVID-19 vaccine series in the last six months. However, over 84% of Canadian children aged five and older have received at least two doses, while less than seven percent of kids under five have received their first dose.
Moderna's CEO, Stéphane Bancel, has reported that the company is working on a combination vaccine for COVID-19, flu, and RSV. However, developing such a vaccine poses significant challenges, including dosing, timing, and age considerations. Experts also question whether getting one combined shot would be as effective as multiple shots.
The article highlights the importance of addressing preventable hospitalizations and deaths among Canadians resulting from the virus. It also mentions the need for more research on the efficacy and safety of combination vaccines before they are widely promoted.
Some key points from the article include:
Fewer than one in five Canadians have received a COVID-19 booster or completed an initial vaccine series in the last six months.
Over 84% of Canadian children aged five and older have received at least two doses, while less than seven percent of kids under five have received their first dose.

The mRNA vaccine technology has saved countless lives around the world from COVID but may not be as effective with other viruses.
More research is needed on the efficacy and safety of combination vaccines before they are widely promoted.
Overall, the article suggests that while there have been significant advances in vaccine technology, there are still many challenges to overcome before we can achieve widespread vaccination against various diseases.
