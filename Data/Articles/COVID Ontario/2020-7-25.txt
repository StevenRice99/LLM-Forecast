Title: Online shopping has doubled during the pandemic, Statistics Canada says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail sales and consumer behavior in Canada. Here are the key points: There was a 17.9% drop in total retail sales in Canada between February and May due to lockdowns and physical store closures. During the same period, online shopping surged, with a 99.3% increase in e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales hit a record high of $3.9 billion in May 2020, a 2.3% increase from April and a significant 99.3% increase from February. Compared to May 2019, e-commerce sales more than doubled, with a 110.8% year-over-year increase. All 11 retail subsectors with an online presence experienced growth in e-commerce sales. The most significant contrast was seen in April data, with total retail sales plummeting by over 25% while e-commerce sales jumped by 63.8%. From February to April, only the food and beverage sector saw a rise in in-store sales, while e-commerce sales for this sector also surged by 107%. Other sectors, such as general merchandise, building materials, health, and personal care, experienced declines in in-store sales but increases in e-commerce sales. The shift to online shopping during the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the retail sector, with small businesses embracing e-commerce platforms. The changing retail landscape is also reflected in the consumer price index and overall retail sales data for May 2020, indicating a significant recovery in sales despite temporary closures. This data suggests that COVID-19 has accelerated the shift towards online shopping in Canada, with consumers increasingly relying on e-commerce platforms even as physical stores reopen. This trend could have long-term implications for the retail industry, potentially leading to a more permanent increase in online shopping and changing the way small businesses operate.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic causes a seismic noise quiet period in 2020
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A global collaboration of 76 authors from 27 countries, including William Minarik from McGill University, published research in the journal Science demonstrating that lockdown measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a 50% decrease in seismic noise worldwide in 2020. This quiet period, referred to as the "anthropause," is the longest and most significant global reduction in anthropogenic seismic noise ever recorded. By analyzing data from over 300 seismic stations, the study visualized the wave of lockdown measures moving from China to Italy and then worldwide. The reduction in physical and social activity, economic slowdowns, and decreased tourism and travel contributed to this unprecedented decrease in seismic noise. The study also revealed that previously concealed earthquake signals became much clearer during lockdown periods, especially in urban areas. This discovery provides a new approach to tracking urban mobility and population density while preserving privacy compared to cell phone-based methods. With increasing urbanization, the authors emphasize the importance of characterizing anthropogenic noise to improve seismological monitoring, especially for detecting hidden signals from earthquakes and volcanoes. This research highlights an unexpected positive environmental impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns and offers a novel method for seismological research and urban planning.

Title: How Canada compares to other countries on COVID-19 cases and deaths
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the varying impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different countries and attempts to understand the factors that influenced infection and mortality rates. While some countries like Greece successfully contained the virus through stringent lockdown measures, others like Germany benefited from a well-developed healthcare system, and South Korea was praised for its extensive testing. Canada's response to the pandemic has been criticized for a lack of preventive public health policies and low testing rates despite the establishment of testing infrastructure. The article categorizes western democracies into three types of welfare states: social democratic, liberal, and conservative or corporatist, each with different levels of government intervention and welfare provisions. Canada is classified as a liberal regime, along with the US, Ireland, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. When comparing COVID-19 cases and deaths per million people, Canada fares better than conservative states in continental Europe and some social democratic nations. However, among liberal democracies, Canada ranks third in cases per million and has a higher death rate than Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. The high number of cases and deaths in the UK and the US may be attributed to delayed lockdown measures and the downplaying of the pandemic's severity by government officials. In contrast, Canada implemented stringent lockdown measures early on. The article suggests that the rise of neoliberalism in Canada, characterized by government cutbacks, decreased public spending, and limited state intervention, may have contributed to the country's response to the pandemic. Additionally, the amalgamation of federal funding for health, education, and social assistance has been criticized for weakening the federal government's capacity to ensure provinces provide adequate healthcare to their citizens. Another factor contributing to Canada's higher mortality and infection rates is the situation in long-term residential facilities, where about 82% of COVID-19 deaths occurred. Among 14 countries, Canada had the highest number of care home resident deaths. The article also highlights the impact of privatization in long-term care, with the Conservative government removing regulations on staffing ratios and daily nursing care hours in 1996. The expansion of private sector involvement in senior care has directed significant funds towards private shareholders. While further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 numbers and welfare state systems, it is clear that Canada needs to improve its response to current and future pandemics. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing healthcare gaps and reevaluating the role of the private sector in long-term care to better protect vulnerable populations.

Title: Expected changes in spending habits during the pandemic recovery period
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines how Canadians' spending habits may change as the economy reopens after the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that may influence these changes. It uses data from a survey conducted by Statistics Canada in June 2020, with responses from over 4,000 Canadians. Overall, a significant proportion of Canadians expected to change their spending habits compared to before the pandemic, with a tendency to reduce spending on discretionary items while maintaining or increasing spending on essentials. The areas with the highest expected reduction in spending were eating at restaurants, entertainment, clothing, recreation, and take-out food. However, respondents also expected to spend more on groceries, education, utilities, housing, and medicine. Financial difficulties played a crucial role in expected spending patterns, with those struggling to meet financial obligations planning to reduce spending on non-essential items and allocate more to essentials. Health concerns also influenced spending, particularly on discretionary activities like dining out. Younger Canadians aged 15-34 expected to increase spending on recreation, entertainment, saving, and investing, possibly due to lower health concerns and higher expectations for economic improvement. Immigrants were more likely than Canadian-born individuals to reduce spending, especially in areas like dining out, transportation, and recreation. Regionally, Quebec residents stood out for their higher expected spending in most categories. The article concludes by highlighting that spending patterns will not only be influenced by financial factors but also by health concerns associated with the reopening of the economy. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians' spending habits and overall well-being. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction. However, it is important to note that changes in spending habits, particularly the reduction in discretionary spending, could have broader economic implications, including potential job losses or business closures, which may indirectly impact healthcare utilization and hospitalizations.

The article highlights the work of Professor Carmen Logie, who is studying the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent refugees in Uganda's capital, Kampala. Here is a summary, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: Over 7,000 refugees, mainly from the Democratic Republic of Congo, have arrived in Uganda since June, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Professor Carmen Logie from the University of Toronto is researching how COVID-19 affects adolescent refugees in Kampala, Uganda. Logie's team is using social media to provide COVID-19 prevention information and gather insights from these young refugees. Logie's project is one of 139 across Canada receiving funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) for COVID-19 research. Logie is adapting the WelTel text-messaging app to connect with young refugees and understand their experiences during the pandemic. The project aims to address the unique challenges faced by adolescent refugees, who often have distinct needs that are overlooked in humanitarian and pandemic responses. The COVID-19 lockdown has exacerbated issues like isolation and food insecurity among refugees in Uganda. Important Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Uganda currently hosts approximately 1.4 million refugees, making it the largest refugee-hosting nation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adolescents and youth make up nearly half of the global refugee population, yet their needs are often overlooked in humanitarian settings and pandemic responses. According to Logie, studies on hand hygiene in Uganda did not include adolescents, underscoring the need to specifically address their unique challenges and experiences. Food insecurity is a significant issue for refugee youth in Kampala, with 70% not having enough to eat before the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown has further exacerbated this problem. The impact of the lockdown on refugees in Kampala has been severe, as many rely on daily income to survive. This has pushed them into deeper poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened problems such as isolation and poverty worldwide, and the refugee population in Uganda is no exception. These facts highlight the unique challenges faced by adolescent refugees in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have implications for forecasting hospitalizations. The increased vulnerability of this population due to poverty, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare could potentially lead to higher rates of infection and more severe cases requiring hospitalization.

Title: Lockdown fatigue, sense of 'invincibility' causing more COVID-19 infections in young people, scientists say
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Scientists in Canada are warning that an increasing number of young people are being infected with COVID-19, which could potentially lead to a severe outbreak. The trend is being observed in several provinces, including British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec. Experts attribute the rise in cases among young people to lockdown fatigue, increased testing, and a sense of invincibility. It is important to note that while young people may not experience severe symptoms, they can still spread the virus to more vulnerable individuals. Health officials emphasize the importance of caution in social gatherings and maintaining safety measures such as social distancing, handwashing, and wearing masks. The increase in infections among women is also noted, which may be due to a higher proportion of women working in healthcare and long-term care homes. To prevent further spread and hospitalizations, experts recommend keeping the Canada-U.S. border closed and adhering to strict protocols to maintain an R value below one, indicating that the epidemic is under control.
