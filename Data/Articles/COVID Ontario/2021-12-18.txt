Publisher: The Narwhal
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the challenges faced by migrant workers in the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on the experiences of workers at Lakeside Produce in Ontario. It highlights issues such as exposure to harmful chemicals like hydrated lime powder, inadequate quarantine accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of job protections for migrant workers, and limited government oversight in ensuring worker safety. The piece also touches on the broader context of Canada's agricultural industry, where a significant portion of produce is exported while a large percentage of what Canadians consume is imported. It sheds light on the systemic issues within the industry, including profit-driven practices, lack of transparency in the food supply chain, and the precarious working conditions faced by migrant workers. The article emphasizes the need for stronger labor protections, improved oversight, and better working conditions for migrant farmworkers in Canada. It also raises concerns about the impact of these issues on worker health and safety, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: The great COVID-19 infodemic: How disinformation networks are radicalizing Canadians - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the growing number of Canadians who are opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine and are spreading misinformation about it on social media. The author spent a month immersing themselves in these online communities and found that they are filled with conspiracy theories, disinformation, and hatred. The groups organize anti-vaccine rallies and share fake news stories about vaccine-related deaths and stillbirths. They also promote baseless theories about an impending social credit system and QR codes. The COVID-19 "infodemic" of misinformation is fueled by social media, and groups continue to operate despite efforts by platforms like Facebook and Twitter to remove them. These communities foster distrust of doctors, media, and the government, and they encourage boycotts of companies enforcing vaccine mandates. Conspiracy theories shared within these groups include claims that the vaccine is a bioweapon, that it alters DNA, and that it is causing an increase in stillbirths and amputations. The theories often rely on emotional language and pseudoscience, and they promote an "us vs. them" mentality between the "awake" unvaccinated and the "asleep" vaccinated majority. Data from Ontario refutes claims made by Ontario MPP Randy Hillier about vaccine-related deaths, and federal data shows that very few deaths in Canada are definitively linked to the vaccines. However, conspiracy theories persist and grow more outlandish, with some claiming that the recent floods in BC were a planned distraction from vaccinations. The pull of these groups is strong, and technology companies' algorithms inadvertently promote them by boosting content that users engage with. Regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article mentions that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provides 70% protection against hospitalization from the Omicron variant, according to a large-scale analysis in South Africa. This highlights the continued importance of vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the Halifax region is causing staffing challenges and service disruptions as more employees are affected by the outbreak, either testing positive or staying home as close contacts. The Halifax Regional Municipality has reported delays in transit services, and bars and restaurants are facing temporary closures due to positive tests among staff. The province reported its highest daily count of new cases (287) on Thursday, with 191 in the central zone, which includes HRM. The rising infections are expected to impact staffing in critical sectors like healthcare, with Nova Scotia Health anticipating shortages. The situation has led to calls for government support for businesses, particularly in the vulnerable hospitality industry. Live events and gatherings have also been impacted, with cancellations and postponements, including the Big Comeback music festival. It's uncertain how long the current restrictions will remain, with a reassessment planned for January.

Title: Alberta considering opening COVID-19 boosters sooner than 6 months: Copping
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Alberta's Health Minister, Jason Copping, expresses caution about the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of vaccination and booster shots in mitigating its impact. The province has made booster shots available to Albertans over 50 and all healthcare workers, with discussions ongoing about shortening the six-month wait period between the second dose and the booster. The Opposition health critic, David Shepherd, calls for an expansion of the booster shot program and the reinstatement of restrictions on unvaccinated individuals during personal gatherings. Copping defends the province's cautious approach to easing gathering rules, stating that the measures are still among the strictest in the country. The number of Omicron cases in Alberta has risen sharply, with 119 cases detected through genetic sequencing, particularly in the Calgary zone. Copping acknowledges the balance between social contact and COVID-19 risks during the holiday season but assures that the government will closely monitor the situation and implement new measures if necessary. While ICU occupancy in the province is currently decreasing, Copping recognizes the potential impact of Omicron's high transmissibility on hospitalizations and announces plans to expand hospital capacity.

Title: Ontario just days from COVID-19 case surge similar to Kingston, expert says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Health officials in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, are tightening gathering restrictions as they deal with the highest rate of COVID-19 infections in the province, with a weekly rate of 350.3 cases per 100,000 residents. Dr. Gerald Evans, an infectious disease specialist, attributes this surge primarily to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, which is expected to become the dominant variant in the region by the following week. The rapid spread of Omicron in Kingston is notable, given the city doesn't have an international airport, and the first confirmed case had no known exposure or risk factors. In response, the area's medical officer of health, Dr. Piotr Oglaza, has limited gatherings and indoor dining to a maximum of five people, with additional restrictions on restaurants and bars. The region's hospitals are feeling the strain, with 35 patients hospitalized and 14 in intensive care, a mix of unvaccinated, younger, and older vaccinated patients with underlying conditions. To manage the situation, Kingston has started transferring patients to nearby cities and is offering take-home tests through doctors' offices to reduce pressure on assessment centers. With Omicron's rapid spread, the situation in Kingston may foreshadow what the rest of the province could soon face.

Title: Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19: Spotlight on Youth, Older Adults & Stigma
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The article highlights the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use, particularly among youth in Canada. Here's a summary along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Mental Health and Substance Use Concerns: The Leger poll commissioned by the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction reveals high levels of mental health and substance use concerns across the country. This indicates a continued need for support and resources in these areas. Youth (16-24) are disproportionately affected, with 45% reporting moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Additionally, around 40% of youth who use alcohol and/or cannabis have increased their consumption in the past month and struggle more with managing pandemic-related stress. This suggests that young people are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health issues and may require targeted interventions. Older adults (65+), on the other hand, demonstrate better mental health, less problematic substance use, and stronger coping skills. This highlights the resilience of this age group in dealing with the challenges posed by the pandemic. Stigma remains a prevalent issue, particularly for alcohol use disorders, which are often more stigmatized than depression. Addressing stigma is crucial to ensuring that people feel comfortable seeking help without fear of judgment or discrimination. The survey also underscores the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with pre-existing substance use disorders or mental illness, who may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic. To effectively address these concerns, continued investments in youth mental health and substance use supports are necessary. Additionally, recognizing the resilience of older adults and further reducing stigma associated with mental health issues and substance use disorders are essential components of a comprehensive response. These findings provide valuable insights into the mental health and substance use landscape in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. They can help inform policies, programs, and interventions aimed at supporting individuals struggling with these issues. Additionally, this information can be useful in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying high-risk groups, such as those with severe mental health concerns or substance use disorders, who may be more likely to require hospitalization if infected with COVID-19.
