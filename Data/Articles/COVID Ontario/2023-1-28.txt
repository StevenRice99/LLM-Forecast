Title: COVID-19 misinformation cost at least 2,800 lives and $300M, new report says
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The Council of Canadian Academies released a report estimating that COVID-19 misinformation in Canada led to at least 2,800 deaths and $300 million in hospital expenses over nine months in 2021. The report highlighted that misinformation caused over 2 million Canadians to refuse vaccination, resulting in 200,000 additional COVID cases and 13,000 more hospitalizations. The study emphasized that misinformation deprived people of their right to be informed and distorted public understanding of risks. Misinformation often relies on simple, emotionally evocative messages and can be tied to personal ideologies or political identities. Social media plays a role in spreading misinformation, and countering it may involve labeling inaccurate information while balancing freedom of expression. The report suggests making reliable information more accessible and providing tools to identify misinformation as ways to address the issue.

Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts related to COVID-19 hospitalizations: Evusheld, a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19, may not be effective against certain Omicron subvariants, including BA.2.75.2, BF.7, BJ.1, BN.1, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB. Health Canada has authorized a booster dose of the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, to be administered at least four months after the completion of the primary series. Paxlovid, an oral antiviral treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk individuals, has been linked to reports of "COVID-19 rebound," where symptoms recur or a person tests positive again after initially testing negative. However, there is no clear evidence that Paxlovid causes the rebound, and it remains a safe and effective treatment option. Health Canada has published information on the limitations of pulse oximeters, including the accuracy of readings and the impact of skin pigmentation. The article also includes a list of health product advisories, recalls, and safety reviews from December 2022, as well as information on unauthorized health products and updates to product monographs. These updates provide important information for healthcare professionals and help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by highlighting the effectiveness of treatments, vaccine boosters, and potential side effects.

Title: The Omicron Booster: Your Questions Answered
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the introduction of updated COVID-19 boosters in the fall of 2022 to match the evolving virus, specifically the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. Here are the key points: The original mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in preventing severe disease and death, but breakthrough infections and reinfections have become more common due to the virus's mutations. Two updated boosters, one from Pfizer-BioNTech and the other from Moderna, have been authorized by the FDA and recommended by the CDC for individuals aged 6 months and older. The updated boosters target the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which were the dominant strains at the time of the article's original publication. The article takes the form of a question-and-answer session with Yale Medicine infectious diseases experts, addressing common concerns and providing insights into the benefits, efficacy, and potential side effects of the updated boosters. The experts emphasize that the updated boosters offer improved protection against infection and severe disease, especially for high-risk individuals and those over 50. They also discuss the possibility of receiving the updated booster after a recent COVID-19 infection, advising individuals to wait at least three months after infection to get the booster. The experts provide information on the safety and side effects of the updated boosters, which are similar to those of the original vaccines. Finally, they highlight the importance of staying up-to-date with vaccinations, including the updated boosters, to protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, particularly with the potential for future waves of infection. This information can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by providing insights into the protection offered by the updated boosters. The boosters are expected to reduce the severity of infections and lower the likelihood of hospitalizations, especially among high-risk groups. However, the ongoing evolution of the virus and the potential for new variants may impact these forecasts.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic Associated With Worse Mental Health and Accelerated Brain Development in Adolescents
Publisher: National Institute of Mental Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article discusses a study that examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and brain development of adolescents. The study found that compared to a pre-pandemic group, adolescents assessed after the pandemic shutdowns reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression, and their brain scans showed thinning of the cortex and reduced volume in the hippocampus and amygdala. The post-shutdown group also had older brain ages, suggesting accelerated brain aging. These findings have important implications for understanding the long-term effects of the pandemic on adolescent development and mental health. While the study provides valuable insights, it is important to note that it focused on a specific population of adolescents in San Francisco, California, and that the participants had a relatively high socioeconomic status. The authors emphasize the need to replicate and extend the findings in more diverse samples, as marginalized groups have been disproportionately affected by the health, economic, and psychological stresses of the pandemic. Additionally, the study did not find a significant association between the duration of social distancing and the psychobiological impacts of the pandemic. Overall, this study adds to the growing body of research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and brain development, and it highlights the need for mental health care and supportive services for adolescents who may be experiencing increased depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic.

Title: Do Rapid Covid Tests Still Work?
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Rapid COVID-19 tests can be unreliable and produce false negatives, especially when used too early after exposure or the onset of symptoms. The tests require a high amount of the virus to be present in the body in order to detect an infection, and when used too early, the viral load may not be high enough to be detected. This is a limitation of rapid tests compared to PCR tests, which are more sensitive and can detect lower viral loads. To increase the accuracy of a rapid test, it is recommended to test at the right time, which is generally a few days after exposure or the onset of symptoms when the viral load is higher.

Title: International team to study impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women caregivers of South African children and adolescents living with HIV
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article announces a research award of nearly $1 million to a team of doctors for their project on the impact of COVID-19 on women's health and economic empowerment. The project aims to study the relationship between women's work and health before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic in lowand middle-income countries. The evidence generated will be used to inform policies and interventions that improve gender equality and health equity, particularly for women caregivers of children and adolescents living with HIV in South Africa. While the article does not directly mention COVID-19 hospitalizations, the focus on women's health and economic empowerment in the context of the pandemic could have indirect implications for hospitalization rates. Improving gender equality and health equity can potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems and decrease hospitalization rates by improving overall health and access to resources. Additionally, the project's impact on the well-being of women caregivers may influence their ability or willingness to seek hospital care for themselves or their dependents, which could have a small impact on hospitalization forecasts.

Title: No More Lockdowns: China’s New COVID Landscape
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: China's Unique COVID Policy and Its Impact: China, where COVID-19 was first detected, initially employed a "COVID-zero" or "zero-COVID" strategy aimed at eliminating the virus through strict lockdowns and containment measures. This approach disrupted lives and the economy but was ultimately unsustainable due to the nature of the virus. The "COVID-zero" policy failed to consider the biology of SARS-CoV-2, which, like its relatives that cause common colds, is challenging to eradicate and has the ability to evolve and escape immunity. Instead of elimination, the focus should have been on fortifying the population's resilience through vaccination, particularly of high-risk individuals with potent and effective vaccines. China's lockdown strategy could have been more successful if paired with improved vaccination campaigns targeting the elderly and vulnerable, rapid testing, antivirals, and ensuring adequate healthcare resources. Impact of China's Policy Shift: China's abrupt shift away from lockdowns and its unique COVID policy has resulted in a spike in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, causing preventable disruptions and loss of life. However, this is not expected to significantly alter the pandemic's trajectory in the United States or other countries with higher population immunity due to prior infections, vaccinations, and boosters. The impact may be felt in global supply chains and travel restrictions, affecting economies dependent on trade with China. Vaccination Efforts in China: China's homegrown vaccine showed some effectiveness, but its protection waned quickly, especially for high-risk individuals. China's early vaccination campaigns fell short in emphasizing the importance of vaccinating the elderly, who are more hesitant and less likely to have received their third doses. The EU offered the more effective Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to China, but Chinese citizens are currently prohibited from receiving it, leading some to travel to Hong Kong or Macao to access Western vaccines. Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations in China: With the highly contagious Omicron variants and insufficient vaccine protection for high-risk groups, it is likely that a significant portion of China's population will be infected. The reported death toll in China is around 60,000 and continues to be revised upward, but the actual numbers may never be accurately known. Conclusion: COVID-19 will come and go in China as it does elsewhere. Cases may have already peaked in major cities, but the impact will vary across the country. The Omicron variant will likely cause significant damage, but the population will eventually develop resilience. However, China missed the opportunity to build that resilience during the past two and a half years.
