Canadian hospitals are facing significant pressure as the number of COVID-19 patients rises, threatening to further strain health-care systems this winter.
As the highly contagious BA.5 subvariant continues to spread, hospital admissions for COVID-19 have increased by 11% since October 1st, according to federal data. This surge has resulted in a shortage of available beds and an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care.
Physicians are warning that vulnerable seniors, particularly those living independently, should take precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19 this fall and winter season. Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics for Sinai Health and the University Health Network in Toronto, recommends that all Canadian seniors consider getting three different shots: an updated bivalent COVID-19 booster, annual flu shot, and pneumonia vaccine if eligible.
The situation is further complicated by a rise in other respiratory illnesses such as influenza and RSV, which are also putting pressure on hospital systems. The pressure on hospitals means that the sickest COVID-19 patients are now being cared for across various wards, including emergency departments and inpatient wards.
Dr. Neeja Bakshi, an internal medicine physician at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, noted that there are hospital-acquired outbreaks continuing to happen, which account for some of the numbers seen. Dr. Dan Rothwerg, a critical care specialist, stated that even if just a small percentage of COVID-19 patients are still falling seriously ill, it can add significant stress to health-care systems.
The experts stressed that patients battling both COVID-19 and another health issue have an increased risk of poor outcomes. With hospitals facing a perfect storm of increased admissions, staffing shortages, and resource constraints, the situation is becoming increasingly dire.
Physicians urge seniors and their loved ones to take precautions to protect themselves from the virus, including getting vaccinated, wearing quality masks, and taking rapid COVID-19 tests before family events. As Victor Moschitto said, "The loneliness will just kill you alone," emphasizing the importance of staying safe while still living life.
In this context, the Canadian government is providing financial support to healthcare systems to address the growing pressures on hospitals.
