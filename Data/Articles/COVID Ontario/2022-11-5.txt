Here is a brief summary of the key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: The article mentions a "triple-threat" of COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Canada, which could lead to an increase in hospitalizations.

The test positivity rate for RSV in Canada was 7.0% for the week of Oct. 29, up from 4.74% in the previous week.

Title: Triple the usual number of kids are coming to Ontario ERs with respiratory illnesses. Here's why
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False

TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Although the article primarily focuses on the surge in respiratory illnesses among children, it provides valuable insights into the current state of hospital capacity and the potential impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare system. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: 1. Hospitals across Ontario are already under pressure due to an unprecedented surge in respiratory illnesses among children, with emergency department visits and admissions exceeding seasonal averages. 2. The surge in illnesses among children is attributed to the withdrawal of preventive public health measures, such as mask-wearing, which has led to increased exposure to germs that kids' immune systems have had little recent experience with. 3. Medical experts expect to see a rise in influenza and COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks as colder weather keeps people indoors, making it easier for infectious diseases to spread. 4. Hospitals are struggling with staffing challenges, and emergency departments have been under sustained pressure for months, with high numbers of admitted patients stuck in the ER due to a lack of available beds on hospital wards. 5. The Ontario Hospital Association reports that ER wait times are longer than normal, and ambulance shortages are occurring due to paramedics spending hours waiting to offload their patients. These factors suggest that Ontario's healthcare system is already strained, and an increase in COVID-19 cases could further exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations and pressure on the healthcare system.
