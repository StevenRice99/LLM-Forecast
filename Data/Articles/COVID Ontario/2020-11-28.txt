Publisher: Alberta Health Services
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the promising news of effective COVID-19 vaccines on the horizon, with drug makers Moderna and Pfizer announcing encouraging results from their vaccine candidates. To provide more insight into the potential COVID-19 vaccine and its next steps, three experts are introduced: Dr. Laura McDougall, Dr. Kristin Klein, and Chris Wood. Key points include: 1. Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness: The speakers emphasize the rigorous process of vaccine development, ensuring safety and effectiveness. This includes large-scale clinical trials involving diverse populations to identify any potential side effects and establish the vaccine's efficacy. 2. Adapting from Other Immunization Campaigns: Drawing on experience from other immunization campaigns can help with a smooth rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. This includes understanding how to reach target populations, effectively communicate about the vaccine, and ensure proper storage and handling of the vaccine. 3. Keeping Staff Informed: Regular updates on the vaccine's progress and providing clear, consistent information to staff are crucial. This helps to address any concerns or misconceptions and ensures that staff are well-informed as the vaccine becomes available. 4. Planning for Distribution: The discussion likely covers the complex logistics of distributing the vaccine, including prioritizing at-risk populations and ensuring equitable access. 5. Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuous monitoring of vaccine effectiveness and safety post-authorization is essential. This helps identify any rare side effects and ensures the vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh any risks. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines play a significant role. High vaccine uptake can lead to a decrease in hospitalizations by reducing the overall number of infections and severity of cases. However, this also depends on various factors, such as the speed and coverage of vaccine rollout, the duration of immunity, and the emergence of new virus variants.

Here is a summary of the article: On November 26, 2020, officials in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, corrected COVID-19 case data from the previous week, citing errors in data collection. The province is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, with the highest number of active cases and hospitalizations to date. In response, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced new measures to control the spread, including: Mandatory masks in indoor public and retail spaces Restricting social gatherings to household members only province-wide Extending the limit on social gatherings in the Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health regions until December 7 Suspending high-risk indoor group fitness activities Suspending all indoor and outdoor community and social events for the next two weeks Suspending in-person faith services No spectators at sporting events, and no travelling outside the local community for sports Asking businesses to keep employees working from home and to enhance safety measures Increased inspections and enforcement of public health orders Discouraging non-essential travel outside of communities Dr. Henry noted that the virus is spreading in healthcare settings, community gatherings, and workplaces, and appealed to young people to help reduce the spread. Health Minister Adrian Dix also announced an increase in contact tracers. The update includes news of four new outbreaks in healthcare settings and one new community outbreak. Despite the challenging situation, Dr. Henry reminded residents that there is hope with the promising news of vaccines on the horizon.

Title: Doctors, engineers call on Ontario to address airborne spread of COVID-19
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
A group of doctors and engineers in Ontario are urging the Health Ministry to better inform the public about the risks of airborne transmission of COVID-19 and to improve ventilation standards. They argue that COVID-19 can spread through microscopic droplets (aerosols) that travel beyond two meters and that the guidelines, regulations, and communication in the province should reflect this understanding. Dr. Jennifer McDonald, one of the doctors who co-signed the letter, conducted an experiment with a carbon dioxide monitor, which showed that the air quality in indoor spaces can be significantly worse than outdoor air, potentially increasing the risk of virus transmission. The group is calling for better guidance for high-risk businesses and improved ventilation assessments and the use of HEPA air filters in places like schools and long-term care homes. They also want practical advice to be offered to the public about improving air quality at home. Dr. Sarah Addleman, another signatory of the letter, emphasizes that information about airborne transmission should not be scary but empowering, as proper ventilation can add an extra layer of protection. She believes that people should have access to accurate information to make informed decisions about their safety. While the Ministry of Health acknowledges the importance of mask-wearing and droplet spread, they also state that transmission by small particles (aerosols) is possible in closed, crowded spaces with poor ventilation but there is no evidence of long-distance transmission through air ducts.

Title: Delays, conflicts and confusion hampered Ontario's COVID-19 response: auditor general
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic response in Ontario, Canada, was hindered by inadequate emergency preparedness, lab capacity, and a disorganized public health system, according to a report by the province's auditor general. The report reveals that the Ford government spent $1.6 million on a consultant to develop a "cumbersome" crisis response structure that excluded public health officials from leadership roles. Laboratory testing, case management, and contact tracing were slow, contributing to the spread of the virus. Public health labs and information systems also had weaknesses that were known after the 2003 SARS outbreak but never addressed. The auditor's key findings include delays and confusion in decision-making, with the provincial government's actions sometimes contradicting public health experts' advice. For example, anyone who wanted a test could get one from May to October, against expert advice. The report also criticizes the slow reaction of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, and the Ministry of Health in the early stages of the pandemic. The auditor highlights the need to act quickly based on reasonable evidence of a public health threat, a key lesson from the SARS crisis. However, Ontario's initial response was slow, as the Ministry of Health downplayed the risk to Ontarians even as the virus spread globally. The auditor also notes that repeated warnings about strengthening the public health system and emergency preparedness since 2003 have gone unheeded. The report concludes that Ontario's pandemic response was slower and more reactive than other provinces and jurisdictions. It offers an opportunity to make positive changes to control and reduce the virus's spread as the province faces a second wave. The Health Minister, Christine Elliott, has expressed disappointment with the report, citing differing views among experts and policymakers during the pandemic. A second report focusing on health expenditures, PPE, and long-term care is expected soon.

Title: How Australia succeeded in lowering COVID-19 cases to near-zero
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses how Australia successfully managed to beat back a second wave of COVID-19 and bring its case count near zero by implementing strict measures to virtually eliminate the virus from its shores. Unlike other countries, Australia aimed to completely eliminate the virus rather than just maintain manageable infection levels. Measures included long lockdowns, roadblocks, curfews, fines for rule-breakers, and strict quarantine requirements for travelers. The approach has largely worked, with cases dwindling steadily. However, it came at the cost of a million jobs and thousands of failed businesses. The article contrasts Australia's approach with that of Canada, where the response to the pandemic has been different. Australians largely accepted the strict measures, leading to widespread compliance. The article also highlights the challenges faced by other countries, like Canada, in controlling the virus due to various factors such as essential workers exempt from quarantine requirements. The article concludes by mentioning the ongoing vigilance in Australia to quickly stamp out any reappearance of the virus, as seen in the immediate lockdown triggered by a single cough in a hospital in Adelaide.

Title: More children hospitalized — some with severe illness — as COVID-19 transmission spikes in Alberta
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
As of Friday, Alberta had recorded 1,155 new daily COVID-19 cases, with 10,655 active cases, 11 new deaths, and 310 hospitalizations, including 58 in intensive care. The increasing case numbers have fueled concerns about the impact on children and teens, with the number of hospitalizations in this age group nearly tripling since early August. While hospitalizations among children remain rare, the province has seen an increase in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare condition triggered by COVID-19 that causes severe inflammation in organs like the heart. There have been seven cases of MIS-C in Alberta, and doctors expect to see more cases as community transmission rises. Doctors emphasize that the risk of severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19 remains low for children, with less than one in a thousand infected children becoming critically ill. However, the increasing infection rates among children, now representing about 20% of cases in Alberta, reflect the spiking community transmission rates. While schools are a minor source of transmission, most children are acquiring the virus through social or family gatherings. To protect vulnerable groups like the elderly, doctors emphasize the need to reduce overall community transmission by closing non-essential businesses and restricting social gatherings.

Title: Workplace compensation claims reflect toll COVID-19 has taken on Canada's workers
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the experiences of COVID-19 "long-haulers," Canadians who have suffered from long-term health issues after contracting the virus. One such individual, Jeffrey Freedman, shared his story of falling ill in April 2020 and spending 44 days in the hospital, most of which were on a ventilator. Freedman experienced lingering symptoms such as "brain fog," vocal cord damage, and neck and bicep pains. He also had a major pressure wound that left him unable to drive or sleep properly. Freedman's workers' compensation claim was approved, and he received support for lost wages and home modifications. The article also highlights the varying levels of coverage for workers' compensation across different provinces and industries in Canada. In Ontario, for example, a quarter of workers are not covered by the workers' compensation system, including those in privately run care homes and the tech and banking sectors. As of November 13, 2022, about 1,425 claims had been disallowed in Ontario, including those from front-line workers in the healthcare sector. Disallowed claims and the fact that the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) only pays 85% of a worker's full salary contradict the notion that front-line workers are considered "heroes." The story of Jennifer Collins, a nurse who contracted COVID-19 at a nursing home in Bobcaygeon, Ontario, is also featured. Collins's claim was denied due to a lack of medical documentation, despite her experiencing lingering health issues such as exhaustion and hip pain. She resorted to applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit instead. The article concludes by discussing the appeals process for workers' compensation claims and how it can be stressful and time-consuming for injured workers, even if their initial claim is approved. Freedman, for example, received notice that his employer was appealing his claim, arguing that they had taken the necessary precautions and that there was no proof he contracted COVID-19 at work. The potential for increased premiums for employers is cited as a reason for appeals, as the workers' compensation system in Canada operates similarly to private insurance.

Title: AstraZeneca says late-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine were 'highly effective' in preventing disease
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, has announced that late-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, developed with Oxford University, showed an average efficacy rate of 70%. Two different dosing regimens were tested, with one showing 90% effectiveness and the other 62%. This vaccine is one of several that Canada has pre-ordered. The trials, conducted in the UK and Brazil with 23,000 participants, showed no hospitalizations or severe cases among those vaccinated. AstraZeneca plans to seek early approval and an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization to distribute the vaccine globally, including in low-income countries. The Oxford vaccine uses a weakened common cold virus combined with the genetic material for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, priming the immune system to attack the virus if infection occurs. It can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which require freezer temperatures. Experts highlight the significance of cost, efficacy, and logistics in vaccine rollout. Dr. Christopher Labos, an epidemiologist, emphasizes that the primary goal of vaccines is to reduce the caseload and prevent serious cases from overwhelming hospital systems. He predicts that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may be more suitable for community distribution due to its storage requirements. AstraZeneca aims to supply hundreds of millions of doses starting in January 2021, with Britain ordering 100 million doses and Canada ordering 20 million. Regulators must now approve the vaccine before widespread distribution can occur.

Ontario, Canada, is experiencing a steep rise in COVID-19 cases, with Toronto and Peel Region moving into lockdown for a minimum of 28 days to curb the spread. The lockdown includes restrictions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, and online instruction for post-secondary institutions. Hospitalizations have increased by 22%, and intensive care admissions by 50%. There are concerns about the impact of the lockdown on small businesses, and experts warn that the measures may not be enough to lower case counts significantly. Other regions in Ontario are also seeing increases in cases, and the provincial government has extended public health orders until December 21.
