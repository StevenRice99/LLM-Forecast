This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: The article presents new modelling that suggests Ontario could see more than 9,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day by the end of the year under a worst-case scenario (5% growth rate). The current growth rate of cases is 0.45% over the past 14 days, but the province is not modelling a decrease in cases and is seeing a flat-line trend. The number of COVID-19 patients in ICUs is expected to exceed 200 in December "under any scenario" and could climb above 300 by mid-December under the 5% growth scenario. There are currently 151 COVID-19 patients in Ontario ICUs, and hospitalizations have increased by 63.2% over the last four weeks. The article also highlights the ongoing issue of outbreaks in long-term care homes, with 104 homes currently in outbreak and 964 confirmed COVID-19 cases (524 residents and 453 staff). These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the potential trajectory of the pandemic and the expected demand on the healthcare system.

Title: Demand spikes for COVID-19 treatment that's saving lives but is in limited supply in Canada

TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values for forecasting: The article reports on the increasing demand for ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) treatment in Ontario hospitals, particularly at Toronto General Hospital, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. In the pandemic's first wave in Ontario, 34 COVID-19 patients received ECMO treatment, and more than half survived. Currently, at least a dozen COVID-19 patients have been hooked up to ECMO machines in the last two weeks, with nine of the hospital's 11 intensive care admissions receiving the treatment. The hospital is working at full ICU capacity, and the ECMO team may have to slow down if the demand continues to rise, which could affect patients waiting for other crucial hospital services such as transplants. Roughly one in every 10 intensive care beds in Ontario is now occupied by someone infected with the virus. The key to lowering demand for limited treatments like ECMO is reducing the amount of community spread of COVID-19. These values suggest that the demand for ECMO treatment and ICU beds is increasing due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, which could lead to a shortage of available resources and impact the quality of care for patients. This information can be used to inform forecasting models and predict the potential strain on Ontario's healthcare system.
