Relevant article for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
COVID-19 is still circulating at a "relatively high level" in Ontario.
Dr. Theresa Tam advises Canadians to stay vigilant and take precautions during the holiday season, including staying up-to-date with vaccinations, masking indoors, and staying home when not feeling well.
Antiviral drug Paxlovid is available to decrease risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those at high risk.
Ontario can expect a surge in COVID-19 cases, possibly followed by an increase in influenza cases, which may strain hospitals.
Key factors for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include:
+ Vaccination rates
+ Influenza seasonality (H3N2 and H1N1 strains)
+ Public health measures (masking, social distancing, testing)
+ Antiviral treatment availability

The provided text is a summary of guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding COVID-19 prevention, treatment, and management. Key points include:
1. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): The NIH COVID-19 Guidelines Panel recommends the use of cIlgavimab plus tixagevimab as PrEP for eligible individuals who are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination or those with contraindications.
2. Treatment Guidance: Antivirals like nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), remdesivir (Veklury), and molnupiravir (Lagevrio) are recommended for treatment in eligible patients, especially those at higher risk for severe disease. However, the characteristics, eligibility criteria, preferred therapy, administration, risk profiles, and use restrictions between these antivirals differ.
3. Testing Guidance: Clinicians should be aware of testing guidance when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating to avoid missing COVID-19 in cases of coinfection.
4. Prevention Measures: All people at risk for severe illness, especially those with moderate to severe immunosuppression, should practice prevention measures like wearing high-quality masks, keeping distance from others, improving ventilation, and developing a care plan that includes prompt testing and access to antivirals if SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected.
5. COVID-19 Vaccination: The CDC recommends staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations, including getting the bivalent booster when eligible, especially for those at higher risk of severe disease.
6. Healthcare Provider Recommendations:
- Stay updated on clinically-indicated therapeutics and authorization.
- Review patient's renal and hepatic function and all medications before prescribing antivirals.
- Be familiar with differences between nirmatrelvir, remdesivir, and molnupiravir.
7. Public Health Department Recommendations:
- Monitor Omicron variants and sublineages in your jurisdiction.
- Disseminate information on prevention measures, treatment options, and vaccination recommendations.
8. Recommendations for the Public:
- Stay up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations.
- Practice prevention measures like wearing masks, improving ventilation, and developing a care plan if immunocompromised.
- Be aware of testing guidance when co-circulating with influenza.
This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the CDC's guidelines for managing COVID-19, including treatment options, prevention measures, and public health recommendations.

Title: Nearly 80 per cent of Ontarians believe health care to be in a 'state of crisis,' new poll shows
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Summary: 79% of Ontarians believe health care is in crisis; long wait times, a lack of beds, and respiratory viruses (including COVID-19) are affecting hospitals. The tripledemic (COVID-19, flu, and RSV) has peaked simultaneously, putting pressure on an already struggling system. This suggests a surge in hospitalizations due to these illnesses.

Title: Children are dying from flu. Some provinces are slow to report it — and these experts say that's dangerous
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Public Health Agency of Canada reported 11 pediatric flu deaths across the country so far this year.
However, only Alberta provided information on pediatric flu deaths, while officials in Ontario declined to provide statistics.
Experts emphasize the importance of transparent reporting on communicable diseases like the flu for public health and safety.
Reporting of child flu deaths can trigger a surge in parents bringing their kids to get vaccinated against the flu, as seen in British Columbia.
Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, confirmed two pediatric flu deaths and emphasized transparency in reporting data.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Pediatric flu death statistics
Public health system transparency
Seasonal influenza trends
Vaccination rates and coverage

Here are the main points from the article:
What is iGAS? 
Invasive Group A Streptococcal (iGAS) infections are caused by a bacteria that can cause serious illnesses.
The more severe forms of iGAS include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), necrotizing fasciitis, meningitis, and septic arthritis.
Symptoms 
Children under one year old, those who haven't been vaccinated against the flu or chickenpox, immunocompromised people, and those with skin conditions like eczema are most at risk.
Symptoms to watch out for in children include trouble breathing, fever, significant change in personality, fatigue, stiff neck, full-body rash, unable to eat or drink, and not urinating.
Adults may experience high fever, difficulty breathing, fatigue, confusion, and widespread reddening of the skin.
Transmission 
iGAS infections can be spread through contact with respiratory droplets from infected individuals.
The bacteria that causes iGAS is present on surfaces and in the environment.
Prevention 
Proper hand washing before eating and after coughing or sneezing, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or elbow can help prevent the spread of iGAS.
Getting vaccinated against the flu and chickenpox can also reduce the risk of developing iGAS.
Current Situation in Canada 
Montreal Public Health has confirmed four cases of iGAS since mid-November, but it's unclear if this is an unusual occurrence or part of a larger trend.
Experts say that with several other viral illnesses circulating right now, some doctors may be seeing more iGAS infections as a result.
Important Notes 
Mild cases of GAS are not nationally reported in Canada, only severe cases like iGAS are.
Experts stress that the more severe forms of iGAS are rare and that most strep throat infections do not develop into invasive group A strep.
