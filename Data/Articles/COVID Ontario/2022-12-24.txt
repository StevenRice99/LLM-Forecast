Posted: 1 day ago
In this Canadian perinatal survey, 42.4% of respondents had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and among the unvaccinated, 72.8% were willing to get vaccinated. The strongest factors associated with vaccination were access to healthcare providers (HCPs) to discuss COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, and believing that the vaccine is effective. The most common worries among respondents were concerns about fetal growth, future behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems in the child, and pregnancy loss. The findings highlight a high vaccine acceptance rate and the importance of addressing concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness to mitigate hesitancy. The study's strengths include the large sample size and representation of different reproductive stages, while limitations include the potential for multiple entries and sociodemographic homogeneity due to self-selection. The most pressing area for continued research is the long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy on child development. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among perinatal individuals in Canada during the early phases of the vaccine rollout.

Here is a summary of the article: Following the rapid easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, outbreaks in popular centers are overwhelming local healthcare systems. Hospitals and medical workers are facing their biggest challenge in handling the nation's most significant outbreak since 2020. COVID-19 patients have flooded hospitals, and there is a shortage of medical staff. Authorities in Henan province have canceled statutory holidays for healthcare workers until the end of March 2023 to combat rising cases. There are also widespread shortages of medicine and self-testing kits. The current public health measures could lead to severe outbreaks in smaller urban areas and rural regions with limited healthcare resources, where there are relatively higher percentages of children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Delayed treatment for non-COVID illnesses and a lack of trust in the government's messaging about recovering at home are also concerns. As of 2021, China had a national average of 3.04 doctors and 6.7 beds per 1,000 residents. The country is preparing to mobilize health resources, such as opening new fever clinics and adding ICU beds in makeshift hospitals. Chinese authorities are reporting low daily COVID-19 case counts, but there are discrepancies with reports from crematorium staff, indicating a higher number of deaths. The government's definition of a COVID-19 death excludes those with pre-existing conditions, which may further misinformation and distrust. China is focusing on bolstering community-level care and plans to build an effective primary-care system. However, there may be a lack of staff and equipment at community health centers. Modeling predicts that without an efficient vaccination drive or control measures, 1.5 million people in China could die from COVID-19 in the next three months, especially among vulnerable citizens.

Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
As of December 2022, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved, but most cases remain mild. Vaccinated individuals especially tend to experience milder cases and often do not require hospitalization. However, there is a growing number of patients with "long COVID," or "long haulers," who experience lingering symptoms months after their initial infection, including "brain fog," fatigue, and pulmonary and cardiac issues. Researchers are still working to understand long COVID, which can affect patients regardless of their initial disease severity. Yale Medicine's Post-COVID-19 Recovery Program treats patients facing these ongoing challenges. For the latest information on COVID-19, it is recommended to refer to official sources such as the CDC and WHO, as well as local government websites.

PAHO delivered over 11,000 vials of the drug tocilizumab to 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries to improve treatment for severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab is a medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe or critical illness, rapid deterioration, increased oxygen requirements, and significant inflammatory response. The drug is an immunosuppressant that delivers monoclonal antibodies targeting and blocking Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors. High levels of IL-6 are found in critically ill COVID-19 patients, inducing an inflammatory response. The WHO added tocilizumab to its list of prequalified COVID-19 treatments in early 2022, and it has been shown to reduce mortality, complications, and hospital stay duration. The availability of this medication is important as COVID-19 continues to cause severe disease and hospitalizations, particularly in at-risk groups such as the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. The purchase and distribution of tocilizumab by PAHO, supported by the US government, is a significant step towards ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 therapeutics in the region.

Pregnant women are more vulnerable to respiratory viruses like the coronavirus due to changes in their immune systems. To protect themselves and their unborn children from COVID-19, pregnant women are advised to take extra precautions, including physical distancing, wearing masks, hand washing, and consulting their doctors regularly. Less frequent in-person appointments and the use of telemedicine are strategies obstetricians are employing to monitor pregnant patients while reducing potential exposure to the virus. COVID-19 vaccination is now authorized for pregnant women and has led to a significant increase in vaccination rates, offering the best protection against maternal and fetal complications from COVID-19 infection. To summarize, pregnant women should prioritize avoiding the coronavirus, take necessary precautions, utilize telemedicine options, and consider vaccination as the most effective way to ensure a healthy pregnancy during the pandemic.

Title: Doctors warn holidays will likely bring COVID-19 infections

The COVID-19 signal in Ottawa's wastewater data is 10 times higher than last December before the Omicron variant emerged, indicating a significant presence of the virus in the community. However, the main difference between this year and last year is the level of concern among the public, with less "existential dread" surrounding the holidays this season, according to epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan. Despite the high COVID-19 levels, there is a lack of concern among the public, and the hospital situation is worse, with less capacity to handle emergencies. Deonandan predicts a bump in infections in January due to indoor gatherings and the current trend of more common, less severe waves. This leveling-out means we may be living with high COVID-19 levels for an extended period. Tyson Graber, an associate scientist involved in Ottawa's COVID-19 wastewater project, agrees that COVID-19 levels are very high but doesn't anticipate a major new wave. The positivity rate in Ottawa is over 10%, indicating a high proportion of positive tests among healthcare workers, which is a good predictor of community spread. The Omicron subvariant BQ 1.1 is dominant in the wastewater, but immune protection is still effective, so a huge surge in cases is unlikely in the coming weeks. Deonandan recommends taking precautions to limit respiratory infections, especially before holiday gatherings, including masking, ventilation, and staying up-to-date with vaccinations. He criticizes government messaging for being too lax and not addressing public concerns about long COVID and repeated infections, which may cause immune damage and reduce the ability to fight future diseases.
