Title: Post–COVID Conditions Among Adult COVID-19 Survivors Aged 18–64 and 65 Years — United States, March 2020–November 2021
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article reports on a study that found COVID-19 survivors have an increased risk of developing certain health conditions in the following year, compared to those who have never had COVID-19. The study used electronic health records from a large, national database to compare the incidence of various health conditions in adults aged 18 and older who had COVID-19 (case-patients) to those who did not (control patients). The conditions studied were those that have been previously linked to post-COVID or long COVID. The key findings of the study include: 38% of case-patients and 16% of control patients developed at least one incident condition, meaning that one in five COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 and one in four survivors aged 65+ may experience long COVID. The most common incident conditions in both age groups were respiratory symptoms and musculoskeletal pain. The highest risk ratios were for acute pulmonary embolism and respiratory symptoms, with case-patients having twice the risk of these conditions compared to control patients. Other conditions with elevated risk ratios for case-patients included cardiac dysrhythmia, musculoskeletal pain, renal failure, thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and various neurologic and mental health conditions. The risks for some conditions, such as cardiac dysrhythmia and musculoskeletal pain, were higher in the 18-64 age group, while the risks for other conditions, such as renal failure and thromboembolic events, were higher in the 65+ age group. These findings highlight the significant burden that COVID-19 can have on survivors' long-term health and the importance of implementing prevention strategies and providing appropriate care for those experiencing post-COVID conditions. The study also underscores the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying these incident conditions and to develop effective treatments.

Title: What Oxygen Level Is Too Low for COVID-19?
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that can cause difficulty breathing and potentially lead to low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be life-threatening. Monitoring blood oxygen levels using a pulse oximeter can help detect low oxygen levels early, even without symptoms like shortness of breath. If oxygen levels fall below 95%, contact a doctor, and if they fall below 90%, seek emergency medical care. Additionally, those with chronic lung conditions should be in close communication with their doctor if they contract COVID-19. Hospital treatment for low oxygen levels primarily involves oxygen therapy, which helps get oxygen into the bloodstream and takes pressure off the lungs during COVID-19 recovery. In severe cases, intubation may be necessary to ensure oxygen reaches the body. To raise oxygen levels at home, individuals can stop smoking, adjust their sleeping position to sleep on their side or stomach, practice pursed-lip breathing, maintain good posture when sitting, get fresh air, and take short walks.

Title: The COVID-19 pandemic and gross domestic product per capita growth in Canada
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and its sources. It finds that while Canada's GDP has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels, GDP per capita has not, decreasing by 1.3% per year during the pandemic from 2020 to 2021. The pandemic significantly affected economic activities in Canada, with restrictions on non-essential activities such as travel, hospitality, and personal services. The article decomposes GDP per capita into five ratios: hourly labor productivity, work intensity, employment rate, participation rate, and the share of the working-age population. It finds that in the long run, labor productivity growth is the major source of Canada's GDP per capita growth, but during the pandemic, the decline in GDP per capita was driven by drops in work intensity, employment rate, and participation rate. The decrease in work intensity was mainly among male workers, while the decrease in participation and employment rates was driven by young people and seniors. If the pandemic had not interrupted the momentum of these ratios from 2010 onwards, Canada's GDP per capita in 2021 could have been 4% higher than it was. The article concludes that understanding the sources of GDP per capita growth is crucial for policy-making and forecasts related to economic recovery and standards of living. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts can be considered: The pandemic has directly impacted GDP per capita, and a decrease in hospitalizations could indicate a recovering economy. The decrease in hospitalizations may lead to an increase in employment and economic activities, improving GDP per capita. The participation and employment rates are likely to increase as hospitalizations decrease, contributing to economic growth. The impact of COVID-19 variants and vaccination rates can influence hospitalizations and subsequent economic activities. The government's response to the pandemic, including restrictions and support measures, will continue to affect economic recovery and hospitalizations. Overall, the article highlights the complex relationship between the pandemic, economic activities, and GDP per capita in Canada, providing insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and their potential impact on the economy.

Title: Workplace real estate in the COVID-19 era: From cost center to competitive advantage
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic caused companies to reevaluate their real estate strategies, with many Fortune 50 companies occupying large amounts of office space that sat empty during the pandemic. Some companies may view real estate as a cost center, but it can also be a source of competitive advantage, helping companies achieve their corporate goals and attract talent. Examples include a European digital firm that designed a studio to attract talent and client work, a technology company that adopted a "virtual first" approach and converted offices into collaborative spaces, and a biotechnology company that invested in a headquarters redesign to enable fast breakthroughs and innovation. To transition real estate from a cost center to a competitive advantage, companies should first determine their corporate objectives and metrics, identify the moments that matter for employees, suppliers, and customers, and set up a steering committee to ensure real estate aligns with corporate objectives. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of having a real-estate strategy that increases connection and collaboration, especially in industries like biotechnology where remote work is not feasible for certain functions. By taking these steps, companies can use their physical footprint to create a competitive edge, attract talent, and improve productivity and innovation. However, it is important for companies to analyze their specific needs and use data to inform their real-estate decisions, rather than simply reducing costs or adopting a fully remote workforce.

Title: Off-season RSV epidemics in Australia after easing of COVID-19 restrictions
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article examines the impact of COVID-19 restriction easing on RSV outbreaks in Australia. Here is a summary: In late 2020, Australian states and territories experienced severe out-of-season RSV outbreaks, which began in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and Western Australia, and later in Victoria in early 2021. Normally, RSV activity in Australia begins in mid-autumn and lasts for six months, peaking in the middle of winter. However, in 2020, RSV activity occurred much later and had higher positivity rates than previous seasons. The suppression of RSV activity in early 2020 coincided with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions, which included limits on international arrivals, quarantine requirements, internal border closures, social distancing, and school closures. The onset of RSV activity in each state varied, with VIC experiencing a three-month delay due to a second wave of COVID-19. The peaks in RSV activity occurred a few months after the relaxation of restrictions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV outbreaks in NSW/ACT and WA were dominated by the RSV-A subtype, specifically the ON1-like genotype first reported in Canada in 2010. The RSV-A viruses formed two distinct genetic lineages, one associated with NSW/ACT/VIC and the other with WA. The VIC outbreak in early 2021 was linked to multiple importations of these lineages. The genetic lineages exhibited several non-synonymous changes in the genome, with the WA lineage having five amino acid changes and the NSW/ACT/VIC lineage having 11 changes. The analysis of RSV-A glycoprotein sequences showed that the viruses from the 2020-21 epidemics did not cluster with other RSV-A viruses, suggesting the source of the lineages remains unknown. The genetic diversity of RSV in Australia collapsed during the COVID-19 restriction period, with only two pre-COVID-19 lineages surviving. The origins of the novel RSV-A lineages are cryptic, but the analysis suggests they may have been present in the country during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of restriction easing on respiratory viruses like RSV. The article suggests that the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions can lead to peaks in RSV activity, which may contribute to increased hospitalizations, especially in children. The delayed onset of RSV activity in VIC due to stricter and longer-lasting restrictions also highlights the impact of restriction levels on respiratory virus outbreaks. Additionally, the reduced genomic diversity of RSV during the COVID-19 restriction period could have implications for future outbreaks and the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines.

Publisher: BMC Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This study, called CONNECT, surveyed social contacts and mixing patterns in Quebec, Canada, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase (CONNECT1) was conducted in 2018-2019, and four additional phases (CONNECT2-5) were conducted during the pandemic to document changes in social contacts. Participants were recruited using random digit dialing and completed a self-administered web-based questionnaire. The study collected data on socio-demographic characteristics and social contacts, including the number, duration, frequency, and location of contacts, as well as physical versus non-physical contacts. The analysis included weighting participants to ensure representativeness and estimating the daily number of social contacts. Workers with more than 20 professional contacts per day were asked to provide general information about their contacts. The study defined different periods based on COVID-19 epidemiology, physical distancing measures, and expected seasonality in social contacts. The analysis compared the mean number of social contacts over time and according to socio-demographic characteristics, and examined the association between contact numbers and a stringency index representing the intensity of public health measures. Finally, the study estimated mixing matrices to describe age-specific contact patterns. This study provides valuable data on social contacts and mixing patterns, which can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and inform public health measures. The different phases of the study capture changes in social behavior during the pandemic, including the impact of physical distancing measures. The analysis accounts for various factors, such as location, age, and the intensity of public health measures, providing a comprehensive understanding of social contact patterns.

Title: Why does COVID-19 cause back pain?
Publisher: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: One unexpected symptom of COVID-19 that has been associated with the Omicron variant is back pain. While back pain alone is not indicative of COVID-19, data from South Africa suggests that it is a key symptom, often occurring alongside a sore throat, nasal congestion, and a cough. According to the Zoe COVID Symptom Study, about one in five people with Omicron experience back pain. The reason for the increase in backache among COVID-19 patients is not entirely clear, but it may be related to generalized muscle pain or myalgia. The sedentary lifestyle and working from home during the pandemic may also contribute to back pain, as a study from Malta found an increase in chronic back pain since the pandemic began. However, it's important to note that backache can be caused by various factors and is not unique to COVID-19. Back pain has also been identified as a symptom of Long COVID, where symptoms persist for months. There is currently no specific advice for dealing with COVID-19-related back pain, but gentle exercise and stretching are recommended. To confirm a COVID-19 infection, testing is necessary. This article highlights back pain as a possible symptom to watch for, especially with the Omicron variant. However, it is not indicative of COVID-19 on its own and can be related to other factors or illnesses. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, while the article does not provide specific data or models, it is important to consider the impact of the Omicron variant. The high transmissibility of Omicron has led to a surge in cases, and while it is generally associated with milder symptoms, the sheer number of infections can still result in a significant number of hospitalizations. Additionally, the article mentions Long COVID, which could have implications for healthcare resources and hospitalizations over a more extended period.

Title: ACT-Accelerator Facilitation Council co-chairs welcome financial and policy commitments made at the Second Global COVID-19 Summit
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The Second Global COVID-19 Summit demonstrated global unity and a shared commitment to ending the COVID-19 pandemic and establishing a better system to tackle future health emergencies. Despite the positive display of unity and new financial pledges, the number of COVID-19 cases is rising globally, and reduced testing rates make it harder to track the virus and detect new variants. To address this, global leaders at the Summit vowed to increase vaccine rollout, strengthen health systems, and improve access to treatments and tests. The ACT-Accelerator, co-chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, received new funding pledges of around US$1 billion. This includes contributions from various countries and organizations. However, there is still a significant funding gap of US$12.1 billion, and failure to meet this could leave vulnerable people without access to vaccines, tests, and treatments. The Summit also saw progress in expanding access to oral antivirals, with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) announcing a lower price for Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and committing to accelerate its delivery. With the pandemic far from over, especially in high-risk groups in lower-income countries, the article emphasizes the critical need to maintain focus and investment in the fight against COVID-19 to ensure that everyone, regardless of where they live, is protected.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: P.E.I. hospitals are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, indicating that the worst of the Omicron wave may have passed. The pandemic has had an impact on inflation, particularly as restrictions ease and demand increases. Charlottetown Airport is expecting more flights and hopes to avoid long lineups. P.E.I. recorded its 33rd COVID-related death, with weekly stats showing the impact of the virus. Enrollment in the province's universal pre-K program has been lower than expected, possibly due to pandemic-related factors. People aged 60 and older are now eligible for a second COVID-19 booster shot. Queen Elizabeth Hospital's Unit 2 is temporarily closed to most new admissions due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Golf courses in P.E.I. are open, signaling a return to normalcy for some outdoor activities. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the following facts: The Omicron wave appears to be subsiding, which may lead to a decrease in hospitalizations. The availability of booster shots for people aged 60 and older could help reduce the severity of the disease and lower hospitalization rates. The closure of specialized cough and fever clinics may impact the number of people seeking medical attention for mild COVID-19 symptoms. The availability of antiviral medications for at-risk individuals may help reduce the number of hospitalizations. The removal of mask mandates in schools in Nova Scotia could potentially increase transmission and impact hospitalizations. It is important to monitor local public health data and guidelines to stay informed about the current situation and any potential risks or waves of COVID-19 hospitalizations.
