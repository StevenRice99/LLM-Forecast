Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Current hospitalizations: 865 (down from 948 on Friday and 1,116 one week ago) Percentage of hospitalizations admitted specifically for COVID-19: 40% ICU admissions: 144 (with 65% admitted due to COVID-19) Ventilator usage: 69 patients New daily cases: at least 1,144 (with a test positivity rate of 8.5%) Testing limitations: actual number of daily new cases likely far higher than reported These values provide insight into the current state of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, including the number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and ventilator usage. The percentage of hospitalizations admitted specifically for COVID-19 and the test positivity rate can also inform forecasting models.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article presents a TCN-based method for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU beds, ventilators, cases, and deaths in Ontario, Canada, and other Canadian provinces. The method uses a combination of factors, including policy factors, weather factors, mobility factors, pandemic progress factors, and vaccination rates. The article reports that the TCN-based method outperforms other models, including PHAC-SEIR, in terms of accuracy and ability to forecast turning points in pandemic trends. The article highlights the importance of using task-specific factors and a suitable history setting (e.g., 14 or 21 days) for accurate forecasting. The article also notes the limitations of the current method, including the need to consider additional factors such as vaccination rates and virus variants, and the importance of developing an automated method to learn the best subset of factors for each forecast. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators Cases and deaths Policy factors (e.g., school closing) Weather factors (e.g., snowfall) Mobility factors (e.g., travel restrictions) Pandemic progress factors (e.g., number of cases and deaths in previous weeks) Vaccination rates and virus variants (not considered in the current study but identified as important for future research) These values can be used to inform forecasting models and improve the accuracy of predictions for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
