The region's medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, notes that new variants will emerge and there will be seasonal resurgences, particularly affecting older people and those with serious medical conditions. Vaccination rates in Waterloo region are low, with only 10% of the population considered up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccines, and 23.9% of the province's population having received the primary series and two boosters. Dr. Wang recommends that high-risk individuals (aged 65 and older, with severe medical conditions, or pregnant) get a spring booster, while others who have had a dose after September 1 and are not high-risk are likely good until the next respiratory season.
