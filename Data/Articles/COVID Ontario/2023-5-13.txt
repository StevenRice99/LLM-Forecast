Title: Experts: COVID-19 pandemic no longer a 'global health emergency' according to WHO
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently announced that the COVID-19 global emergency is over, indicating a shift in how the world responds to the pandemic. While the pandemic is no longer considered an "emergency," experts from McGill University caution that COVID-19 remains a significant problem with shortand long-term complications and potential for new variants to cause future issues. Professor Michael Libman emphasizes that COVID-19 is still worse than the flu in terms of overall impact and should not be minimized. He highlights the ongoing emergence of new variants, which could pose future challenges. Libman's research focuses on tropical and travel-related illnesses, including the epidemiology of imported infections. Meanwhile, Assistant Professor Matthew Oughton provides context by stating that the WHO's declaration doesn't mean COVID-19 is over. Instead, it signals that the disease is becoming endemic with seasonal variability. He suggests that governments should now transition from emergency responses to managing COVID-19 as an ongoing infectious disease. Oughton's expertise lies in infectious diseases and medical microbiology, with a research focus on improving clinical diagnostic assays for various pathogens. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, several factors should be considered: Immunity and Vaccination Rates: Increased population immunity due to vaccinations and previous infections can reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Monitoring vaccination rates and the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants is crucial for forecasting. Severity of New Variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can impact hospitalization rates. Variants with higher transmissibility or increased ability to evade immune protection may lead to more hospitalizations. Healthcare System Capacity: The capacity and resources of healthcare systems play a vital role in managing COVID-19 cases. Hospitals with adequate staffing, intensive care beds, and ventilators may be better equipped to handle a surge in cases and reduce severe outcomes. Seasonal Variability: COVID-19, like other respiratory infections, may exhibit seasonal patterns. Forecasting models should consider potential surges during winter months or specific seasons. Public Health Measures: The implementation or relaxation of public health measures, such as mask mandates, social distancing, and travel restrictions, can influence the spread of COVID-19 and subsequent hospitalizations. By incorporating these factors into forecasting models and closely monitoring COVID-19 trends, public health officials and healthcare systems can better prepare for potential surges in hospitalizations and allocate resources effectively.

Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses two churches in southwestern Ontario that are taking their battle with the province over COVID-19 restrictions to Canada's highest court. The Aylmer Church of God and the Trinity Bible Chapel have faced fines and legal action for defying pandemic restrictions, including holding indoor gatherings. The Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms is representing the churches in their appeal bid to the Supreme Court of Canada. The churches argue that the restrictions violate their Charter rights. The case has gone through the court system, with previous appeals being dismissed. This ongoing legal battle highlights the challenges faced by religious institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: What you need to know about Title 42, the U.S. COVID-19 border restriction that's expiring
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: As the United States prepares to lift COVID-19 restrictions on Thursday night, a large number of migrants are gathering at the Mexican border. The restrictions, known as Title 42, were implemented in March 2020 by the Trump administration to curb the spread of COVID-19 in crowded detention centers. Since then, it has been used to expel migrants over 2.7 million times, although many of those expelled are repeat crossers. The Biden administration's decision to lift Title 42 is expected to result in a further increase in illegal crossings, as migrants seek to enter the U.S. before the new asylum restrictions take effect. The new Biden regulation, which will take effect immediately after Title 42 ends, will make most migrants who cross illegally ineligible for asylum. U.S. authorities plan to process migrants quickly and deport them if they fail initial asylum screenings. To manage the expected increase in migrant arrivals, nearly 500 USCIS personnel will be temporarily reassigned, and the Pentagon will send 1,500 troops to support Border Patrol. However, there are concerns that the Biden administration may struggle to hold and deport migrants without additional funds from Congress. The termination of Title 42 is expected to face legal challenges, as a group of Republican-led states previously blocked its termination in court. Additionally, a bipartisan group of senators is working to pass a bill that would grant immigration authorities the power to expel migrants for another two years. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also announced the deployment of a new tactical force to "intercept and repel" migrants. U.S. border cities are already dealing with a spike in migrant arrivals and are bracing for more once Title 42 ends. The cities of Brownsville, El Paso, and Laredo have declared emergencies, and El Paso is opening additional emergency shelters. New York City, which has received thousands of migrants from Texas, has suspended some rules guaranteeing shelter for those in need. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the potential impact of the increased migration and the crowded conditions in which migrants are traveling and living. This could lead to a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission and potentially contribute to an increase in hospitalizations, especially if there is a lack of adequate medical care and resources in these areas.

Title: Three years, 1.1 million deaths: COVID emergency ending in US
Publisher: Al Jazeera English
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the United States, with over 1.1 million deaths and nearly 104 million infections recorded since the start of the pandemic. The country has experienced multiple waves of infections, with the Omicron variant causing the most dramatic surge in cases. The pandemic has also had economic consequences, with 22 million job losses in the early months and widespread unemployment. The US government has invested heavily in pandemic recovery, distributing over 676 million vaccine doses and achieving an administration rate higher than the world average. However, political polarization and misinformation have complicated vaccination efforts, with only 69% of Americans completing the initial vaccine protocol. The pandemic has also taken a toll on healthcare workers, with many experiencing burnout and planning to leave the profession. Existing social and economic inequalities have been exacerbated, with racialized Americans facing elevated risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Looking forward, infection rates are currently low, but the ongoing risk of new variants means that COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths will need to be continuously monitored.

Title: The Rise and Fall of the Raccoon Dog Theory of Covid-19
Publisher: The Intercept
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a new paper by American virologist Jesse Bloom that questions the role of raccoon dogs in the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, has been a key battleground in the debate about COVID-19's origin, as many early COVID cases in Wuhan were linked to the market, which sold live animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Raw data from environmental swabs collected at the market in January 2020 was recently released, sparking media reports suggesting a link between raccoon dogs and COVID's origin. However, Bloom's analysis of this data found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in raccoon dogs or other animals at the market. He also criticized media coverage that emphasized the co-mingling of raccoon dog and viral material, noting that the greatest co-mingling involved species unlikely to be infected. The article highlights the iterative scientific process and the potential negative impact of sensational media headlines on the credibility of scientists. While the debate about COVID-19's origins continues, this article underscores the importance of careful data analysis and nuanced scientific communication to the public.

Title: United States to end COVID-19 vaccination requirements for international travellers
Publisher: Dentons
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 vaccination requirement for non-citizen international travelers to the US will be removed starting May 12, 2023. This decision by the US government is justified by the significant decline in COVID-19 deaths (down by 95% since January 2021) and hospitalizations (down by nearly 91%). Additionally, global COVID-19 deaths are at their lowest since the pandemic's start. With a large portion of the American population vaccinated (nearly 270 million with at least one shot), the government believes it is time to lift the restrictions. This change aligns with Canada's previous decision to remove all COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements on October 1, 2022, ensuring consistency between the two countries' border policies. It's important to note that the removal of the vaccination requirement doesn't mean the pandemic is over, and future forecasts should still consider the potential impact of COVID-19 variants and waves on hospitalizations.

Title: Expensive energy may have killed more Europeans than covid-19 last winter
Publisher: The Economist
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses how Vladimir Putin weaponized Russia's energy supplies after invading Ukraine in February 2022, leading to a surge in gas prices in Europe. This resulted in a significant increase in domestic electricity and gas prices last winter, with costs rising by 69% and 145% respectively compared to two years earlier. The situation caused by Russia's actions could be considered a crucial factor in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Energy price hikes can lead to increased financial strain on households, potentially impacting their access to healthcare and ability to self-isolate effectively. Additionally, higher energy costs may affect the operations of healthcare facilities, influencing their capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine could indirectly influence COVID-19 hospitalization rates, making it an important consideration in forecasting.

Title: Real production and real income growth over the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian economy, focusing on the relationship between real production, real income growth, and real GDP. It highlights that during the pandemic, real consumption and real gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) grew at a stronger pace than real GDP, which is unusual as they typically progress similarly. The study examines how changes in production and non-production sources of real income growth, such as the terms of trade, have influenced this trend. Key findings include: The terms of trade were a major source of real income growth during the pandemic, supporting consumption and GFCF beyond changes in production. Real income growth outpaced real GDP growth since the pandemic began, with stagnation in production efficiency due to disruptions like global supply chain issues. Major gains in real income came from improvements in the terms of trade, but their volatility raises uncertainty about the permanence of these gains. The shift in investment composition towards housing stock affected growth in multifactor productivity (MFP), impacting the overall productivity of the Canadian economy. The article suggests that while real income has seen significant gains, uncertainties remain due to factors like the war in Ukraine affecting commodity markets and recent increases in interest rates. The study emphasizes the need for time to address challenges in production efficiency and adapt to changes in organizational structures and workplace cultures post-pandemic.

Title: A COVID legacy? When doctors say we should still be masking up
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the shift in mask-wearing behavior in Canada following the World Health Organization's declaration that COVID-19 is no longer a "public health emergency of international concern." Despite this declaration, experts like Dr. Allison McGeer emphasize that the pandemic is not over, and the importance of continuing to wear masks in certain situations to reduce the spread of COVID-19, influenza, and other viruses. While many mask mandates have been lifted, some large hospitals still require masking in patient-care settings. Health experts like Dr. Lynora Saxinger and Dr. Fatima Kakkar stress the importance of masking in healthcare settings to protect both healthcare providers and vulnerable patients. They believe that masking could become a positive legacy of the pandemic, especially in high-risk environments like long-term care facilities. The decision to wear masks should be based on individual risk assessments, with considerations for protecting oneself and others, especially for those who are immunocompromised or in high-risk settings. Dr. McGeer and other experts suggest that the normalization of mask-wearing in certain situations could help mitigate the spread of viruses. Ultimately, the article highlights the importance of using common sense in deciding when and where to wear masks, and the need for continued access to information from governments and public health authorities to make informed decisions. While some experts hope that public health measures like masking and handwashing will continue as legacies of COVID-19, there is uncertainty about whether these practices will be maintained in the long term.
