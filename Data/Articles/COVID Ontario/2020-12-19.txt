Title: These nursing home chains have the highest COVID-19 death rates in Ontario, data analysis finds
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article presents an analysis by CBC's Marketplace, which reveals that not all for-profit long-term care homes in Ontario have been equally effective in containing COVID-19. The analysis focuses on data from the Ministry of Long-Term Care on outbreaks in Ontario homes until December 13 and pairs it with home ownership data. It considers only homes that have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks, excluding those with no outbreaks in areas without community transmission. The findings indicate that Southbridge and Rykka Care Centres homes had higher death rates compared to other for-profit care homes, with 9 and 8.6 deaths per 100 beds, respectively. Other companies, such as Sienna, Revera, Chartwell, and Extendicare, had lower death rates, but still higher than the non-profit and municipal averages. The non-profit and municipal homes had average death rates of 2.8 and 1.4 per 100 beds, respectively, while the overall for-profit homes averaged 5.2. Pat Armstrong, a professor at York University, highlights that ownership is a significant factor, and her research consistently shows differences in quality-of-care indicators among ownership types. She also emphasizes the need for more staff, especially in for-profit homes. The COVID-19 Science Advisory Table in Ontario identified chain ownership as a crucial risk factor for outbreak magnitude and resulting resident deaths. Despite their poor performance during the pandemic, some companies continue to apply for more beds. The article mentions the case of Orchard Villa, owned by Southbridge, which was awarded 87 additional beds despite a high death toll in the first wave. There is also opposition to Rykka's proposal to take over a not-for-profit care home in Toronto, with a petition highlighting their failure to protect residents and workers. The article includes responses from the companies, with Rykka disputing the analysis as flawed and claiming that early COVID-19 outbreaks significantly impacted most long-term care homes regardless of ownership. Southbridge did not respond to requests for comment. Companies with higher-than-average death rates attributed the outcomes to factors such as the age of homes, timing of outbreaks, community spread, and infection prevention protocols. Experts agree that home design is a factor but not the only one. They point to existing problems in long-term care, such as lower staffing levels in for-profit homes, as contributors to the difference in COVID-19 death rates. The article also discusses the financial complexities of rebuilding and upgrading long-term care homes. The methodology note explains that CBC's analysis focused on homes with at least one outbreak and calculated death rates based on total deaths and total potential exposures (beds in homes with outbreaks) for each parent company.

Title: Why has Italy suffered so badly during the pandemic?
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Italy has been one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a high number of cases and deaths. On a per-capita basis, Italy ranks 37th in the world for the number of COVID-19 cases but fourth for deaths, with a significant number of fatalities per million people. Several factors have contributed to Italy's high death toll: 1. Aging Population: Italy has the oldest population in Europe, with over 22.8% of its people aged 65 and above. Older individuals are more susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19. Additionally, a 2017 report indicated that many elderly Italians suffer from multiple underlying health conditions, further increasing their risk. 2. Social Structure: In Italy, it is common for younger generations to live with their elderly family members. This close contact may expose older, more vulnerable individuals to the virus. 3. Underfunded Health System: Italy's public health system has faced prolonged underfunding, resulting in a shortage of medical staff and resources. This lack of preparedness and organization has hindered the country's ability to effectively manage the pandemic and provide optimal care to patients. 4. High Prevalence of Health Conditions: As mentioned, a significant proportion of Italy's elderly population have underlying health conditions, which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Almost half of those over 65 take multiple medications daily. 5. Lack of Preparedness and Organization: During the summer months when cases were lower, Italy failed to adequately recruit additional staff or develop plans to reorganize their healthcare system in anticipation of future waves. 6. First Wave Impacts: The initial wave of the pandemic heavily impacted northern Italy, overwhelming emergency wards and resulting in difficult triage decisions. This contributed to a higher death toll early on. As the second wave of the pandemic sweeps through Italy, the death rate remains high, and the country continues to grapple with the challenges posed by COVID-19. The high number of hospitalizations and deaths underscore the need for improved healthcare resources and a more robust public health system.

Title: Two parts of a pandemic: How the coronavirus spread in Canada
Publisher: Radio-Canada.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article analyzes the spread of the coronavirus in Canada during two distinct periods: the first from March 11 to July 28, and the second from July 29 to December 15. Here are the key points: During the first wave, the virus hit central Canada hard, particularly Quebec and Ontario, with a deadly impact on seniors in long-term care homes. In the second half, three times as many Canadians tested positive, mainly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Despite the increase in cases, the death rate decreased in the second half due to improved knowledge and patient care. As of December, the average daily deaths were 102 in Canada, with 34 in Quebec and 22 in Ontario. Hospitalizations are increasing, and a record number of Canadians may spend Christmas in the hospital. Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba had the highest cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while Quebec, Manitoba, and Ontario had the highest deaths per 100,000. The article allows readers to search for data by postal code to compare their region with the rest of the country. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to monitor the daily case counts, test positivity rates, and the reproduction rate (Rt) of the virus. The rate of hospitalizations among cases (known as the "case hospitalization ratio") and the average length of stay in the hospital are also crucial factors. These data can help predict the strain on the healthcare system and guide public health measures to control the spread.

The first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines has arrived in British Columbia, with approximately 4,000 doses available. The initial distribution plan targets Lower Mainland healthcare workers in long-term care homes and those essential to the COVID-19 response. Immunization of these individuals will begin in the coming days, with Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health contacting staff to schedule appointments. Weekly vaccine deliveries to all health authorities are expected to start the week of December 21st, with availability and approval dictating the timeline. As more vaccines become available, they will be provided to other priority groups throughout the province. To ensure a smooth rollout, a registration and record system is being developed, allowing individuals to register for vaccine access and receive an official record of immunization. This initial vaccine delivery is a significant step forward in British Columbia's fight against COVID-19 and will help protect those on the front lines of the pandemic.

Title: How Science Beat the Virus
Publisher: The Atlantic
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
By December 2020, COVID-19 had caused an unprecedented shift in scientific priorities, with thousands of researchers pivoting their focus towards the pandemic. This has resulted in a surge of COVID-19-related scientific papers, with over 74,000 published as of that time, outnumbering those on longstanding diseases like polio, measles, and cholera. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the personal impact on scientists' lives contributed to this massive mobilization. The COVID-19 pivot has accelerated scientific advancements and innovations. New diagnostic tests can now detect the virus within minutes, and massive open data sets have provided detailed insights into the disease's evolution. Vaccines are being developed at record speed, with 54 candidates being tested and 12 entering Phase 3 trials. The development of platform technologies, where a standard chassis can be customized to target new viruses, has played a crucial role in this process. However, the pandemic has also exposed frailties in the scientific enterprise, including flawed research, wasteful clinical trials, and the publication of misleading information by overconfident poseurs. Despite these challenges, the intense focus on COVID-19 is expected to deepen our understanding of viruses and improve our preparedness for future pandemics.

Title: Pregnant women with COVID-19 at increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and early labour
Publisher: UBC Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A national surveillance project in Canada has revealed early findings that suggest pregnant women with COVID-19 may be at a higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and early labor compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age. The project is led by Dr. Deborah Money, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UBC. The preliminary findings are based on data from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and include 869 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 in Canada, with 430 cases analyzed from three provinces. The data shows that 11% of these women were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and 2.4% were admitted to the ICU, compared to a 1.7% hospitalization rate and 0.3% ICU admission rate for non-pregnant women in the same age group in BC and Ontario. The data also suggests that COVID-19 may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, with 15% of babies born to women with COVID-19 being premature, which is double the national average. However, most infants (84%) were not admitted to the NICU, and transmission of the virus to infants appears to be rare. These early Canadian findings align with emerging international evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 have a low absolute risk of severe illness but an increased risk compared to non-pregnant women of the same age. The project aims to improve the understanding of COVID-19 in pregnancy and provide data to inform clinical and public health recommendations for pregnant women and their infants. The early findings are already helping to shape public policy and clinical guidelines, which will continue to be updated as more data becomes available from across Canada. However, it is important to note that COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been tested on or approved for use in pregnant women. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations for pregnant women, the following key points from the article may be useful: Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of hospitalization and ICU admission compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age. The data suggests an increased risk of preterm birth, which could lead to potential complications requiring hospitalization. As the pandemic evolves and more data becomes available, these findings may change, and the numbers are expected to increase as more provinces report their data. The project aims to provide ongoing data to inform clinical and public health guidelines, which could help forecast and prepare for potential increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations for pregnant women.
