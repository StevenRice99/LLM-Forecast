Title: 'V-Day': First COVID-19 vaccines administered in Canada

Ontario, Canada has begun its COVID-19 vaccination program with an initial batch of 14 programs being rolled out. However, infectious disease specialist Isaac Bogoch describes this first batch as a "trial run" until more shipments arrive in the coming days and weeks.
The province will receive 249,000 doses from Pfizer by the end of December, which is a small fraction of the total 20 million doses Canada has ordered. By the end of March, Canada is expected to receive four million doses, enough to fully vaccinate two million people.
Those being vaccinated this week won't achieve full immunity until the second week of January, and the provinces will be responsible for tracking who has been vaccinated and ensuring they return for their second shot.
Despite this milestone, officials are warning that the pandemic is far from over. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020, and Canada has confirmed over 460,000 cases of COVID-19 and close to 13,500 deaths.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not the only option available; Moderna's vaccine candidate has yet to be approved by Health Canada but has less complicated storage requirements. Provinces are preparing to receive this vaccine option later this month.
Canada has signed deals with seven vaccine manufacturers, securing over 400 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. The federal government aims to have all Canadians who want to be vaccinated receive their shots by the end of 2021.
