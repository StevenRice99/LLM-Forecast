Trusted: False

14 restaurants and bars were fined or summoned to court for violating COVID-19 rules.
Most violations related to failure to check proof of vaccination (13 establishments) and improper mask-wearing (5 establishments).
This suggests that some businesses are not strictly enforcing the vaccine passport requirement, which could potentially lead to increased transmission rates and subsequently hospitalizations.

Title: Hospitalizations and emergency department visits trends among elderly individuals in proximity to death: a retrospective population-based study
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The study found that as death approached, there was a sharp increase in hospitalizations and emergency department visits (EDVs) per individual. The findings suggest that:
1. There is an exponential increase in the number of individuals who access acute healthcare services as they approach death.
2. Younger decedents and cancer patients are more likely to use these services.
3. There is a significant difference in healthcare utilization trends between hospitalizations and EDVs, with EDVs being lower than hospital admissions due to many hospital admissions being scheduled.
4. Age-related trend differences were not as marked as those for hospitalizations, but the proportion of individuals aged  95 years who had accessed the emergency department was lower.
5. The total number of EDVs per individual underwent a sharp increase as death approached.
The study also highlights some limitations, such as:
1. Lack of cost analyses and data on hospice and palliative care services.
2. Absence of quantitative and qualitative data on hospitalizations and EDVs (i.e., admission diagnosis or hospitalization department).
3. Possible bias derived from the lack of adjustment for healthcare services such as primary care, long-term care, and home assistance.
The study suggests that targeting interventions to reduce the use of acute healthcare services among specific groups, such as younger decedents and cancer patients, may be beneficial. Additionally, potentiating primary care support and specific healthcare facilities for respiratory disease patients could also be effective in reducing hospitalizations and EDVs at the end of life.
Some potential implications of this study include:
1. Developing targeted interventions to reduce acute healthcare service use among high-risk groups.
2. Potentiating primary care support to reduce hospitalizations and EDVs.
3. Providing specific healthcare facilities for respiratory disease patients.
4. Conducting cost analyses and examining trend differences related to specific causes of death.
5. Comparing healthcare utilization trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall, this study provides valuable insights into healthcare utilization trends at the end of life and highlights potential targets for interventions to reduce acute healthcare service use among vulnerable populations.
