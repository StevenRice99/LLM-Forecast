Title: COVID-19 spreads through the air. Here's what you can do about it this winter
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of different measures in reducing the spread of COVID-19, particularly in indoor settings during the winter season. While the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) recommends increasing ventilation and using HEPA filters, it has not explicitly acknowledged the primarily airborne nature of the virus or advised Canadians to upgrade their masks to more effective options. Linsey Marr, an expert on virus transmission, suggests that Canada is lagging in promoting the use of higher-filtration medical masks, such as surgical or N95 masks, which offer better protection. The article also highlights the evolving understanding of the virus's airborne transmission through aerosols, which can linger in the air and transmit the virus over distances greater than two meters. Mario Possamai, a forensic investigator, criticizes Canada's public health leaders for their failure to implement simple and cost-effective airborne protective measures, which he believes has led to unnecessary deaths and infections. Experts recommend layering different levels of protection, such as proper masking, ventilation, and filtration, in addition to high vaccination rates and vaccine passports for indoor spaces, as the most effective way to reduce the spread. They emphasize that these measures are particularly important as Canadians spend more time indoors during the winter. Looking forward, the article cautions against prematurely lifting COVID-19 public health measures, such as mask mandates, when cases are low. Experts advocate for a data-driven approach to mask policies, where precautions are reinstated in response to surges or new variants. By combining vaccination efforts with practical measures, Canadians can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 and live their lives more responsibly during the pandemic.

The article discusses the research conducted by a team of over 100 researchers at the University of Toronto, led by Angela Cheung and Margaret Herridge, on the shortand long-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The Canadian COVID-19 Prospective Cohort study (CanCOV) investigates the factors influencing disease progression and severity, including genomics, demographics, and social factors. Several factors, such as age, general health, and pre-existing conditions, influence patient recovery. Mechanical ventilation and other ICU interventions can be life-saving but may also have consequences, including muscle breakdown, immobility, and profound weakness. These issues can result in functional dependency and life-long disabilities, cognitive and mood disorders, and challenges in daily activities and returning to work. The study aims to recruit 2,000 patients and 500 family caregivers from the four hardest-hit provinces in Canada. The research team includes experts from various fields, recognizing the impact of caregiving on patient recovery. The early pandemic data shows that there were over 42,000 hospital stays for COVID-19 patients in Canada, with an average length of two weeks, and approximately 8,400 admissions to intensive care. Additionally, an estimated 78,000 people in Ontario may have experienced "long COVID," with symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, and shortness of breath. Kelly O'Brien, a U of T associate professor, draws parallels between long COVID and disability related to HIV/AIDS, emphasizing the episodic nature of the condition. O'Brien's research contributes to understanding the nature and extent of episodic disability in long COVID, guiding rehabilitation access and workplace policies. Jill Cameron, another associate professor, studies caregiving and its impact on family members, highlighting the increased stress, mental health challenges, and reduced support faced by caregivers during the pandemic. The research provides valuable insights into the ongoing pandemic's impact on patients and caregivers, with potential implications for patient care, rehabilitation, and policy development.

Title: COVID-19 vaccines for children 5-11 are safe and effective
Publisher: Hamilton Health Sciences
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Experts at McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) recommend that children aged 5-11 receive the COVID-19 vaccine as it is safe and effective for this age group. The Pfizer vaccine, approved by Health Canada for children 5-11, is a lower dose (10 mg) than the adult formulation (30 mg) and is mixed with a slightly different liquid. Clinical trials show that the lower-dose pediatric vaccine generates similar levels of antibodies, providing protection against COVID-19. Dr. Jeffrey Pernica, an MCH infectious diseases specialist, answers frequently asked questions about child vaccine safety and efficacy. The vaccine is recommended for children aged 5-11 as a preventative measure, even though they are at low risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. It can help protect them from infection and prevent the spread to others, especially with the Delta variant. Uptake of the vaccine for youth aged 12-17, available since August 2021, has resulted in over 70% of Ontario youth in this age group being fully vaccinated. MCH is actively involved in the Hamilton Public Health strategy by providing expertise, participating in vaccination clinics, working with pediatric healthcare professionals, and offering support for youth with special needs. This information can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by encouraging vaccine uptake in the 5-11 age group, similar to the success seen in the 12-17 age group. The vaccine's effectiveness in preventing severe disease and reducing hospitalizations is crucial in managing the pandemic and ensuring adequate healthcare resources.

Title: COVID-19: Quebec drops vaccination mandate for health-care workers
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Quebec has decided to abandon its enforced COVID-19 vaccination mandate for healthcare workers as the healthcare network cannot afford to lose thousands of unvaccinated employees. While 97% of Quebec's healthcare workers are vaccinated, 14,000 have not received a first dose, 5,000 of whom are in direct contact with patients. The loss of unvaccinated staff would have reduced services and compromised efforts to improve working conditions. The vaccination rate among healthcare workers has increased since the government first announced its mandate, but the government has decided that the potential loss of staff is too great a risk. Unvaccinated staff will be required to undergo regular COVID testing, and while vaccination will not be mandatory for current employees, it will be for new hires. The health minister warned that unvaccinated workers may be replaced as more vaccinated employees become available. This decision has sparked concerns from healthcare professionals, who worry that it is not based on scientific guidance and that unvaccinated workers are at higher risk of hospitalization.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rediscovery of the outdoors, with people spending more time in natural spaces and engaging in outdoor activities. This shift has highlighted the importance of outdoor play for children's health, well-being, and development, and presents an opportunity to address inequities in access to nature across communities. The Outdoor Play in Canada: 2021 State of the Sector Report provides direction on increasing outdoor active play for children, including promoting the health benefits of outdoor play, advocating for equity and inclusion, and leveraging engagement with the outdoors during and after the pandemic. During the pandemic, there was initially a decrease in children's outdoor physical activity due to physical distancing restrictions. However, over time, people began to spend more time outdoors and in green spaces, with research from Norway showing that these behavioral changes lasted up to six months. The pandemic has also led to policy reforms and family support enhancements that can increase opportunities for outdoor play and quality time spent outdoors, such as flexible workplace policies and investments in daycare and paid sick leave. Promoting outdoor play is not just important for children's health and well-being but also for the long-term health of the environment. Spending time in nature at a young age can foster a respect for the natural world and develop the next generation of environmental stewards. Additionally, global lockdowns during the pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, highlighting the potential for behavioral changes to have a positive environmental impact. Overall, maintaining adaptations and policy reforms that support outdoor play can benefit children's health and development and contribute to a healthier environment for future generations.
