Title: WHO roadmap on uses of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of Omicron and high population immunity
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released an updated roadmap for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in light of the Omicron variant and high levels of population immunity. The guidance, last updated on November 10, 2023, aims to optimize the global impact of COVID-19 vaccines. Here is a summary of the key points: WHO continues to prioritize protecting all high-risk groups, including older individuals (i.e., >60 years of age), health workers, and people with comorbidities, against severe disease and death. The primary vaccination series for individuals without contraindications remains essential. It induces good protection against severe disease and death and reduces the impact of COVID-19 on health systems. A booster dose is recommended for those at the highest risk for severe disease and those aged 50 years, ideally within 4-6 months after the last vaccine dose or infection. This recommendation considers the current global vaccine supply and the goal of sustaining protection against severe disease over time. For the general adult population, a booster dose can be offered, considering individual risks and benefits, vaccine supply, and the goal of preventing severe disease. The interval between the last vaccine dose in the primary series and the booster dose can be shortened to 4 months during periods of intense transmission or in anticipation of rising COVID-19 cases. Individuals who have received a booster dose may be offered an additional booster dose during periods of high transmission or when facing a high risk of severe disease, with a minimum of 4 months between doses. The composition of future vaccine formulations should be based on strains that are more transmissible, immune-evasive, or pathogenic. Efforts should be made to increase vaccine coverage globally, especially in under-reached populations, to close the vaccination gap and ensure equitable access to vaccines. Surveillance systems and research should be strengthened to monitor vaccine effectiveness over time, including against emerging variants, and to guide policy decisions. This roadmap aims to provide guidance to policy-makers, public health authorities, and vaccine manufacturers to optimize the use of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The recommendations will be updated as new evidence emerges on vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and the emergence of new variants.

Title: Ivermectin warnings, a new COVID-19 antiviral, a changing threshold for care: These are the WHO's updated treatment guidelines
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued updated guidelines for treating COVID-19 patients, offering categories of hospitalization risk to aid doctors in tailoring treatments. These guidelines also provide recommendations for a new antiviral drug designed to target COVID-19 specifically. Notably, the thresholds for hospitalization risk have been adjusted, making it easier for non-severe COVID-19 patients to access medication. One significant change is the redefinition of an "important reduction" in hospitalization risk. Previously, a drug needed to guarantee at least a 6% reduction in hospitalization risk to be prescribed for non-severe cases. Now, a 1.5% absolute reduction is considered significant, allowing more treatment options for doctors to consider. The guidelines also introduce a moderate risk category for non-severe COVID-19 patients, helping doctors focus treatment on those who need it most. Patients are considered moderate risk if they fulfill certain requirements, such as being over 65 or having specific comorbidities. Several drugs have been recommended for different risk categories: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid): Strongly recommended for high-risk patients, conditionally recommended for moderate-risk patients, and conditionally recommended against for low-risk patients. Remdesivir: Conditionally recommended for high-risk patients, conditionally recommended against for moderate-risk patients, and strongly recommended against for low-risk patients. Molnupiravir: Conditionally recommended for high-risk patients, conditionally recommended against for moderate-risk patients, and strongly recommended against for low-risk patients. Additionally, the WHO has issued updated warnings against the use of ivermectin for treating COVID-19, even in research settings, due to its very low likelihood of providing any benefit.

Posted: 1 day ago
COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, presents a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and some people may even be asymptomatic. While most people experience mild symptoms and recover without issues, older individuals or those with pre-existing health conditions are at a higher risk of developing more serious symptoms, such as breathing difficulties. The most common COVID-19 symptoms include fever, chills, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms can appear anytime between 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. It is important to monitor these symptoms as they can be indicative of the need for hospitalization, especially for individuals who are at higher risk. Early identification and treatment can help reduce the severity of the disease and prevent further complications.

Title: N.B. changes definition of 'serious' COVID-19 vaccine reactions, cuts number in half
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: New Brunswick has changed how it defines "serious" adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, which has resulted in a decrease in the number of reported serious incidents. Between December 2020 and August 2023, there was one serious incident for every 13,550 COVID-19 vaccinations administered in the province. The definition of a serious adverse event is now aligned with the Public Health Agency of Canada's definition, which includes reactions that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization, or result in significant disability. Previously, New Brunswick combined "serious" and "medically important" adverse events, but now a medically important event can be classified as either serious or non-serious. Most of the reported adverse reactions have been classified as non-serious, and there have been no reported adverse events following immunization with the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks, according to the Public Health Agency. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the following: The definition of a serious adverse event and the criteria used to classify reactions. The majority of adverse reactions are classified as non-serious. There have been no reported adverse events following immunization with the updated XBB.1.5 vaccines. The Public Health Agency's assessment that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks. The regular monitoring of immunization data to identify any unusual safety trends. Reviewing data from across Canada to identify any new or emerging trends. By considering these factors and analyzing the data on adverse reactions and hospitalizations, public health officials can make informed decisions and forecasts regarding COVID-19 vaccine safety and the impact on healthcare systems.

A COVID-19 outbreak has been declared at a hospital in the Victoria area, with 15 patients infected but only mild illnesses reported. While this is concerning, new data from the BC Centre for Disease Control suggests that the recent COVID-19 surge in British Columbia may be decreasing, with decreases in hospitalizations, deaths, and test positivity rates. In the week ending November 4th, there were 144 new COVID-19 hospitalizations, less than half of the 296 hospitalizations from three weeks prior. However, there are still ongoing outbreaks at two hospitals in the Fraser Health region. The Provincial Health Officer and Health Minister are set to provide an update on respiratory illnesses and immunization campaigns in British Columbia.

Title: Canada has 'sufficient supply' of new COVID-19 vaccines amid 'pandemic amnesia,' experts say
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the recommendation of new COVID-19 vaccine doses to combat the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant, a mutation of COVID-19 that is spreading despite misconceptions that the virus is no longer a threat. Canada has sufficient supply of Moderna Spikevax and Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccines targeting the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, with over 12 million doses available and more on the way. The Public Health Agency of Canada states that individuals vaccinated with these updated vaccines are expected to have a better immune response against current strains. The agency advises that these vaccines can be safely received with other doses, like the seasonal influenza vaccine. While every province and territory in Canada now has supply of updated mRNA vaccines, public awareness about the importance of booster shots has decreased. Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine warns of "COVID amnesia" and emphasizes that although the situation is better than in previous falls, it is not completely safe. The PHAC collaborates with jurisdictions for vaccine distribution, but provinces and territories decide their vaccine requirements.

Title: ‘Vaccine passports’ effective in boosting COVID-19 vaccine uptake: study
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A recent report in Health Affairs found that proof-of-vaccine mandates can effectively increase vaccination rates, but the effect may be short-lived. The study observed a mandate implemented in Canada's 10 provinces in the fall of 2021, which resulted in a 17.5% increase in first-dose uptake. However, vaccination rates returned to pre-announcement levels within six weeks, even with the mandate still in place. The decline was more prominent among those aged 12-17. Despite the initial positive response, particularly from younger people, the mandate's influence on behavior was temporary. Currently, there are new COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that target the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. Getting vaccinated with these new vaccines is crucial, as they can provide protection against severe outcomes like hospitalization, especially for those who are immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions. According to Dr. Saqib Shahab, the new vaccines offer protection similar to a flu vaccine and can help prevent serious illness, even though most people experience mild symptoms when infected with COVID-19.

Here is a summary of the article: This fall, updated COVID-19 boosters are available to protect against severe COVID-19 infections. Dr. Kelly Grindrod, a pharmacist, and associate professor at the University of Waterloo answers common questions about the COVID-19 booster vaccines. First, there are different boosters available, and it is recommended to ask for the updated vaccine when receiving a COVID-19 booster shot. For those who cannot or prefer not to receive an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), Novavax is offered as an alternative. According to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), it is recommended that everyone who has previously received a COVID-19 vaccine gets the updated Omicron XBB.1.5 booster, especially for those who are at higher risk, such as older adults, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, and individuals living in congregate settings. It is generally safe and recommended to get the influenza vaccine and the COVID-19 booster simultaneously. However, consulting a healthcare provider or pharmacist is advised to ensure it aligns with one's health circumstances. For individuals receiving their first COVID-19 vaccine dose this fall, it is recommended to wait at least six months before getting the booster dose. The ideal timing for a COVID-19 booster depends on the previous vaccine or infection, with a typical recommendation of at least six months after the last COVID-19 vaccine or infection. The University of Waterloo will offer Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 booster vaccines to its community members starting November 15. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the uptake of these updated boosters, especially among vulnerable populations. The effectiveness of the boosters in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, as well as the circulation of new variants, will also impact hospitalization rates.
