Here is a summary of the article and the scientist's feedback:
Article Summary: 
A study published in October 2023 found that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications. The study, led by Sarah Jorgensen, analyzed data from over 1 million births in Ontario, Canada, and found no significant increase in neonatal or all-cause readmissions among babies born to vaccinated mothers.
McCullough's Erroneous Claims: 
Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist, claimed that the study had several flaws, including:
Failing to account for negative pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirths and miscarriages
Excluding cases of readmission that occurred at other hospitals
Showing an increased risk of neonatal and all-cause readmissions among babies born to vaccinated mothers
Scientist's Feedback: 
Sarah Jorgensen, the lead author of the study, responded to McCullough's claims by:
Explaining that stillbirths had already been studied in another publication and that miscarriages were not available in the provincial databases used for this study
Clarifying that all hospital admissions across Ontario were included in the analysis, including cases where an infant was discharged from one hospital and readmitted to another
Pointing out that McCullough's claims about increased readmissions were incorrect and that the study found no significant increase in either outcome among babies born to vaccinated mothers.
Study Conclusion: 
The study concluded that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe, with no significant increase in neonatal or all-cause readmissions among babies born to vaccinated mothers. The study's findings are consistent with other published studies that have shown that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase the risk of pregnancy complications and may actually reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.
