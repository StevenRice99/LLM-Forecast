Posted: 1 day ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: Recent trends show a moderate to high level of community transmission of COVID-19 and an increase in COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes (LTCHs), with an increased risk of hospitalization amongst residents. There have been 5,459 COVID-19 cases among long-term care residents, with 181 people hospitalized from Aug. 27, 2023 to Oct. 28. The virus is projected to possibly peak in the next few weeks, around the same time that the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are expected to increase. The case fatality rate among long-term care home residents with COVID-19 is currently 3.6%, down from 30% in the early days of the pandemic. Experts emphasize the importance of masking and vaccination in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, especially in long-term care homes. These values suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, particularly in long-term care homes, and highlight the importance of masking and vaccination in preventing severe outcomes.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses a study by Jorgensen et al. that analyzed data from over 140,000 pregnant women in Ontario, Canada, and found that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with adverse newborn outcomes. The study also found that the risk of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and admission to intensive care units was lower among babies born to vaccinated mothers. The article highlights the importance of considering confounding factors when analyzing data, as the crude data suggested a higher rate of neonatal and all-cause readmissions among babies born to vaccinated mothers, but this association disappeared after adjusting for potential confounders. The study's findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and effective in reducing the risk of severe disease and pregnancy complications. This information can be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly among pregnant women and newborns. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and effective in reducing the risk of severe disease and pregnancy complications. The risk of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and admission to intensive care units is lower among babies born to vaccinated mothers. Confounding factors should be considered when analyzing data to avoid misinterpretation of results. The study's findings are consistent with other published studies that have shown the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.

Title: Virtual urgent care didn't divert Ontario patients from ER visits during pandemic, study suggests
Publisher: CBC News

Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses a study that assessed over 19,000 virtual urgent care visits across Ontario from December 2020 to September 2021. The study found that nearly 13% of patients went to the emergency department in person within three days of a virtual visit, and almost 22% did so within a month. This suggests that virtual urgent care did not have a significant impact on reducing emergency department visits during the pandemic. The study also found that young adults, city dwellers, and those from higher-income neighborhoods accessed virtual services more frequently, and that those who already had a family physician or primary care provider accessed virtual services the most. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, from this article include: The proportion of patients who visited the emergency department in person after a virtual urgent care visit (13% within 3 days, 22% within a month) The demographics of patients who accessed virtual urgent care services (young adults, city dwellers, higher-income neighborhoods) The proportion of patients who had a primary care provider (85%) These values can be used to inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly in terms of understanding the potential impact of virtual urgent care services on emergency department visits and hospital admissions.
