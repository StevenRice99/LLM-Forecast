This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The World Health Organization (WHO) has ended the global COVID-19 emergency, citing increased immunity, fewer deaths, and less pressure on hospitals. Despite this, Canadian experts warn that COVID-19 will remain a challenge to public health for years to come and has left lasting scars on the health-care system. COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada remain stubbornly high, with 2,881 hospital beds occupied by COVID patients across the country, according to the latest federal data. Experts emphasize the need to maintain vaccination rates, particularly among more vulnerable populations, to prevent a further burden on hospitals. The article highlights the importance of addressing issues in long-term care and hospitals, as well as basic societal inequities around pay and staffing in the health-care system. The article also mentions that only about two-thirds of Canadians over the age of 60 have been previously infected, and fewer than 20% have received a shot in the past few months, leaving a significant part of the population vulnerable to infection and hospitalization. These points suggest that while the global COVID-19 emergency has ended, COVID-19 will continue to pose a challenge to the health-care system in Ontario, Canada, and that ongoing efforts are needed to address these challenges and prevent future surges in hospitalizations.
