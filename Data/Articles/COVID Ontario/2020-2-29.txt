Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the global panic surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak and the efforts to control its spread. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian doctor who led a WHO team to China's Hubei province, offers insights and recommendations based on his experience. Key points include: Global markets are in a frenzy, and countries like Japan, Australia, and Italy have taken drastic measures to contain the virus. The WHO has declared the global risk as "very high." Dr. Aylward emphasizes that the outbreak can be controlled, citing China's unprecedented response as an example. He highlights the importance of swift and decisive action by public health authorities. The virus spreads rapidly, but community transmission is mostly clustered rather than widespread. Speed is critical in containing the outbreak. Dr. Aylward praises China's aggressive response, including the shutdown of Hubei and strict movement restrictions. He also acknowledges the country's initial delay in addressing the outbreak. Other provinces in China have lower infection rates, and the country's experience offers reason for cautious optimism. He emphasizes the importance of public awareness and engagement, stating that success depends on the population's understanding and response to the disease. Dr. Aylward commends Canadian health authorities for their quick response and believes their efforts have paid off, with relatively low case numbers. He warns that large numbers of cases may arise and recommends sealing off hospital wards for COVID-19 patients. The low positive test rate in Guangdong province, China, is encouraging. Dr. Aylward suggests that measures like school closures, as implemented in Japan, are prudent in the face of escalating transmission. He advises against using the term "pandemic," as it implies uncontrollability. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, some critical factors to consider include: The speed and effectiveness of public health measures implemented by authorities. Swift and decisive action can significantly impact the outbreak's trajectory. Public awareness, education, and engagement are crucial. A well-informed population that follows preventive measures and understands the disease's symptoms can help identify and contain potential cases more effectively. The experience in China and other countries suggests that early and aggressive interventions can significantly curb the spread. The potential for rapid increases in case numbers should be anticipated, and healthcare resources must be delegated efficiently to manage the influx. The positive test rate and transmission patterns provide valuable insights. The low positive test rate in Guangdong province indicates that widespread infections may be lower than expected. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of swift and comprehensive action, public engagement, and learning from the experiences of other countries to forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations effectively.

Title: WHO reluctant to declare COVID-19 pandemic as coronavirus spreads to more countries
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China, has now spread to multiple countries worldwide, with new epicenters in Italy and Iran. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against declaring a pandemic, the sudden rise in cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea is concerning. Public health officials in Canada have reported a fifth case in Ontario and a seventh case in British Columbia, while dozens of Canadians infected in Japan remain under quarantine there. The risk to the public in Canada is currently assessed as low. In South Korea, the number of cases has risen to 1,595, with most new infections in Daegu. The U.S. military reported an infected soldier near Daegu, and the South Korean military has 20 cases on its bases. Japan's Prime Minister has called for the cancellation or reduction of sports and cultural events for two weeks, impacting professional baseball and the upcoming Olympics. At least 47 Canadians on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan tested positive, and those who did not test positive are currently under quarantine in Ontario. In the Middle East, Iran has reported 139 cases, but the problem is likely bigger. Saudi Arabia has temporarily suspended entry for the Umrah pilgrimage. Kuwait and Bahrain have reported increases in cases linked to travel to Iran. Iraq has banned its citizens from traveling to several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran, and ordered the closure of public gatherings and schools. In Europe, Italy has become a growing area of concern, with empty cafes and restaurants in Milan and a wave of cancellations in the tourism industry. The country has reported 374 confirmed cases and 12 deaths, all elderly with underlying health issues. Cases linked to Italy have been reported in several European countries, and two hotels in Austria and Spain are locked down. France has reported its second death and a total of 18 cases. To forecast hospitalizations due to COVID-19, it is important to consider factors such as the transmission rate, severity of the disease, and healthcare system capacity. The transmission rate can be influenced by factors such as population density, travel patterns, and the effectiveness of containment measures. The severity of the disease, including the proportion of cases requiring hospitalization and the average length of stay, will impact the demand for healthcare resources. The capacity and resilience of healthcare systems, including the availability of intensive care beds and ventilators, will determine the ability to manage a surge in hospitalizations.

Title: Coronavirus: How behaviour can help control the spread of COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Historical Context: The Spanish Flu: During WWI, the Spanish flu pandemic emerged, infecting a quarter of the world's population and resulting in a higher death toll than the war itself (50-100 million deaths). It was caused by the H1N1 virus. 2009 H1N1 Outbreak: H1N1 resurfaced in 2009, spreading globally but with a much lower death rate than the Spanish Flu. However, it still caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. COVID-19 and Hospitalizations: Behavioral Herd Immunity: The article introduces the concept of "behavioral herd immunity," which suggests that by implementing precautionary behaviors that block infection routes, the spread of an epidemic can be prevented or limited without relying solely on quarantine measures. Precautionary Behaviors: Frequent and proper handwashing Covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing Avoiding close contact with infected individuals Disinfecting mobile device screens twice daily (portable petri dishes for bacteria and viruses) Avoiding touching your face (mouth, nose, eyes, ears) Wearing masks only if you are ill and encouraging others to do the same Self-quarantining if you have a fever Brainstorming additional behavioral changes with your social network Strengthening Herd Immunity: Emphasizes the importance of focusing on increasing the prevalence of these precautionary behaviors to strengthen herd immunity and prevent the spread of COVID-19. This approach can help control the proliferation of the virus and reduce hospitalizations. The article concludes that while a vaccine is important, it is currently unavailable, and individual and collective behavioral changes are crucial in the meantime to prevent COVID-19 epidemics and manage hospitalizations.

Title: COVID-19 coronavirus not a pandemic — yet
Publisher: Canadian Geographic
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that while the COVID-19 coronavirus has the potential to become a pandemic, it is not yet at that stage. The WHO defines a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease, and the declaration is based on the spread of a virus, not the severity of the illness it causes. As of the article's publication, COVID-19 had been declared a "public health emergency of international concern," with over 2,600 deaths in China and 23 deaths outside the country. The WHO believes that the virus can still be contained, and encourages countries to take action to do so. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the virus's spread, severity, and the healthcare system's capacity. The article also highlights Canadian Geographic's "Unmasking Influenza" project, which provides resources and information on past pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu, and their impact and legacy.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) has begun a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug remdesivir in treating COVID-19. This is the first clinical trial in the US to test a potential treatment for COVID-19, which was first detected in December 2019 in China. As of February 24, 2020, there were over 77,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with 2,595 deaths in China and 23 deaths in other countries. Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an experimental broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has shown promise in treating other coronaviruses, such as MERS and SARS. The trial will enroll hospitalized adults in Nebraska who have COVID-19 and will compare the effectiveness of remdesivir to a placebo in improving clinical outcomes. This trial is designed to be adaptable and may include additional investigative treatments or enroll participants from other sites worldwide. The study will monitor participants' clinical outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 levels, with the initial results expected after 15 days of treatment. This clinical trial is a crucial step in the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19 and will provide valuable data on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir.

Here is a summary of the article: The Public Health Agency of Canada announced that the remaining 195 Canadians who were under quarantine at the Canadian Forces Base Trenton in Ontario have been released. These individuals were repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, on a government-chartered flight. They completed their 14-day quarantine period without developing any symptoms of the novel coronavirus. The Canadian government provided transportation to Toronto for their onward travel to their final destinations. The Trenton base served as the primary housing facility for Canadians airlifted from Wuhan and, previously, for initial screening for Canadians evacuated from the Diamond Princess ship in Japan before they underwent quarantine in Cornwall, Ont. A Calgary man, Carter Perrier, shared his difficult experience during the quarantine, highlighting the mental health challenges and the support provided by nurses. The health agency reiterated that the risk of COVID-19 spreading to Canadians remains low, even in the communities where the repatriated citizens are returning. The statement also expressed gratitude to the repatriated individuals and their families for their cooperation and urged the public to treat them with respect and compassion.

Title: Who is 'patient zero' in the coronavirus outbreak?
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
It is difficult to determine who the first patient of the COVID-19 outbreak was, but identifying them can provide crucial information about the virus and how it spread. As of February 2020, the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak was uncertain, with Chinese authorities and experts disagreeing. While early cases were linked to a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, a study published in The Lancet claimed the first diagnosed case had no link to this market. The World Health Organization (WHO) still considers the market as the likely source. Identifying patient zero can help address key questions about the outbreak and prevent future infections. For example, the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was traced to a two-year-old boy from Guinea, and Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," was a healthy carrier who spread typhoid fever in New York in 1906. However, the term "patient zero" can be stigmatizing and lead to disinformation or victimization, as in the case of Gaetan Dugas, wrongly blamed for spreading HIV to the US. As of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had registered over 75,000 cases globally, with the majority in China's Hubei province.
