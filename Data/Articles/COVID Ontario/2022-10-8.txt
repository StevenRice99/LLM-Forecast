Title: Adding COVID-19 to ‘designated diseases’ could boost vaccine uptake among children
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Summary: 
Children's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 has increased in frequency and severity over the course of the pandemic.
Low vaccination uptake among minors (41% completed primary series for 5-11 year olds, <6% first doses for under 5s) is a concern.
Increased infections among children will lead to more severe outcomes, including hospitalizations.
Adding COVID-19 to the list of designated diseases in Ontario may help address low vaccination uptake and increase protection for school-aged children.
