Title: More Than 12.7 Billion Shots Given: Covid-19 Tracker
Publisher: Bloomberg
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 vaccine has played a crucial role in changing the course of the pandemic, with 162 doses administered for every 100 people worldwide. While the Omicron variant caught the world off guard in late 2021 due to its high transmissibility, vaccinations, especially with a booster, reduced the chance of hospitalization and death by more than 90% during that wave. This disparity in outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals led health officials to refer to the current phase as a "pandemic of the unvaccinated." The rollout of vaccines has been uneven globally, with countries with the highest incomes vaccinating their citizens 10 times faster than those with the lowest incomes. This uneven distribution presents a significant challenge to global health efforts. Infectious disease experts suggest that vaccinating 70% to 85% of the population could lead to a return to normalcy, but the current pace of vaccinations falls short of this goal. As countries reassess their pandemic policies, it's important to consider the ongoing risk of severe illness and the need for booster shots to control the virus.

Title: Findings suggest COVID-19 rebound not caused by impaired immune response
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A small study of eight patients published in Clinical Infectious Diseases suggests that COVID-19 rebound is likely not caused by an impaired immune response. The study was led by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), investigating the characteristics of COVID-19 rebound in patients who had taken the antiviral therapeutic Paxlovid. COVID-19 rebound is defined as a recurrence of symptoms or a new positive test after initially testing negative. The study included participants who had taken Paxlovid shortly after symptom onset and experienced recurrent symptoms, as well as a control group. Investigators found no evidence of genetic mutations suggesting resistance to Paxlovid or delayed antibody development in those experiencing rebound. Instead, rebound symptoms may be driven by a robust cellular immune response to residual viral RNA. While all participants had been vaccinated and boosted, the authors note that larger epidemiologic studies are needed to fully understand COVID-19 rebound. The current data suggests the need for isolation during symptomatic rebound and the evaluation of longer Paxlovid courses for immunocompromised individuals. This study provides valuable insights into COVID-19 rebound and will help inform strategies to manage and prevent it, contributing to more effective COVID-19 treatment and control.

Title: Largest study on COVID-19 in Canadian children and teens now underway
Publisher: Université de Montréal
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The Canadian government and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research are funding a $2.6 million study called CURNLS to conduct a serosurvey of children and youth for SARS-CoV-2. The study will collect and test about 7,200 blood samples from patients aged 0 to 18 who visit hospital emergency departments across Canada to identify past COVID-19 infections and immunity. The data collected will help inform public health policy and predict future pandemic trends. The study is led by Drs. Soren Gantt and Caroline Quach-Thanh from the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre and Université de Montréal. The larger POPCORN network, also led by Dr. Quach-Thanh, monitors COVID-19 infections, vaccination, and social impacts among Canadian children and youth. The CURNLS study has several goals, including determining the rates of seropositivity due to infection and vaccination, understanding the differences in seroprevalence among different age groups and regions, and examining the associations between serologic measures and trends of viral transmission and vaccination rates. The data generated will help predict future pandemic trends and understand the role of children in community transmission. The COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF), established by the Government of Canada, oversees and funds the CURNLS study. The CITF supports research on SARS-CoV-2 immunity to provide insights for decision-makers and minimize the impact of COVID-19.

Title: Deaths Among Older Adults Due to COVID-19 Jumped During the Summer of 2022 Before Falling Somewhat in September
Publisher: KFF
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
As of October 2022, COVID-19 has claimed nearly 1.1 million lives in the US, with people 65 and older accounting for about 75% of these deaths. While vaccinations and treatments have reduced severe illnesses and deaths, the lag in booster uptake led to a rise in deaths among older adults in summer 2022. From April to July, COVID-19 deaths increased for all ages but rose faster for older adults. The rise in deaths is attributed to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, low booster uptake, waning vaccine immunity, and relaxed COVID-19 measures. Vaccination rates for the primary series are high among those 65+, but booster uptake is lower. This age group has consistently accounted for a larger share of COVID-19 deaths, reaching 88% in September 2022. People 85 and older represent a significant proportion of COVID-19 deaths, highlighting their continued vulnerability. The total number of deaths for those 65+ more than doubled from April to July and remained high in August, with over 11,000 deaths each month. While deaths declined in September, they remained higher for those 65 and older compared to April and May. The data emphasizes the importance of staying up to date with vaccinations, including boosters, to prevent severe disease and deaths, especially among older adults. The relatively low booster uptake among older adults raises questions about further encouragement and support to ensure they stay protected against COVID-19.

Title: Global Health & Gender Policy Brief: Mental Health and COVID-19
Publisher: Wilson Center
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, particularly in vulnerable populations. The pandemic has disrupted people's social environments and led to shutdowns and restrictions on movement, resulting in social isolation and poor mental health. Here are the key points from the article: Mental distress was highest when COVID-19 mitigation measures were strict and death tolls were high. Globally, protective factors for mental health, such as employment and social connection, decreased during the pandemic, while risk factors like bereavement and financial insecurity increased. Adolescents and youth are at heightened risk of developing mental health conditions, with the pandemic doubling the prevalence of clinical depression and anxiety in this demographic. The pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of pregnant people, with increased isolation and uncertainty about COVID-19's effects on pregnancy contributing to added stress. Refugees and displaced persons face multiple stressors that impact their mental health, and those who experienced discrimination during the pandemic reported worse mental health outcomes. Investments in data, research, and policy-making focused on population mental health are necessary to address the drivers of mental health issues in vulnerable populations. Financial investment in mental health education, prevention, screening, and treatment is crucial, along with increasing resources and support services for at-risk populations. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the mental health impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations. The adverse mental health outcomes may lead to an increase in hospitalizations as people seek treatment for their mental health conditions or develop physical health complications related to poor mental health. Additionally, the impact of long COVID, which can cause ongoing symptoms and impact mental health, may also contribute to future hospitalization rates.

Title: Employment levels during COVID—some provinces fared better than others
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some key facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Canadian employment, particularly in industries like international travel, personal services, food and accommodation, tourism, and entertainment. The initial wave in the spring of 2020 resulted in a sharp decline in employment, with a 5.3% drop in jobs in March followed by an additional 11% decline in April 2020, causing a total loss of nearly three million jobs. It took until November 2021 to recover to pre-pandemic employment levels. When comparing employment levels between January 2020 and January 2022, overall Canadian employment showed a modest increase of 0.33%. Some provinces, like British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Alberta, experienced stronger rebounds, with employment levels 2.3%, 1.9%, and 1.7% higher than pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Other provinces, like Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario, also saw improvements but to a lesser extent. Prince Edward Island, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador had not yet returned to their pre-pandemic employment levels. The article suggests that the variation in employment recovery across provinces may be influenced by a combination of historical regional factors and the impact of pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions. A chart included in the article indicates a correlation between more restrictive policies, as measured by a stringency index, and more negative monthly employment performance. Nova Scotia and British Columbia are highlighted as examples of effective pandemic response, as they managed to balance COVID-19 mitigation with strong employment recovery, despite Nova Scotia having the third-highest stringency measures and British Columbia the third-lowest. Their experiences may offer valuable insights for future pandemic management strategies. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, some key considerations include the impact of employment changes on healthcare capacity and the potential for increased hospitalizations due to economic reopening and increased social contact. Additionally, the stringency of public health measures and their effectiveness in controlling infections may influence hospitalization rates, as suggested by the article's correlation between stringency and employment performance.

Title: Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19: Regional Spotlight and Key Factors
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The report highlights that mental health and substance use concerns have been elevated across all provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic, with around 35% of respondents experiencing moderate to severe mental health issues. This increase in mental health concerns has had a significant impact on substance use, with about 25% of people who use alcohol or cannabis exhibiting problematic usage patterns. Key findings also indicate that financial worries have been the primary source of pandemic-related stress in most regions, except Quebec, where social isolation topped the list. Furthermore, pre-existing or current mental health issues significantly increase the likelihood of substance use disorders, and vice versa, creating a cycle that exacerbates both problems. The report identifies age, gender, 2SLGBTQ+ identity, income, and employment status as the most critical factors influencing mental health and substance use concerns. To address these concerns, policymakers should prioritize improving access to a diverse range of support services, especially for those most vulnerable. These services should not only treat but also promote resilience to help individuals better cope with mental health and substance use challenges. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the report does not provide direct predictions. However, the strong link between mental health, substance use, and overall health suggests that regions with higher rates of mental health and substance use concerns may also experience increased healthcare demands, including hospitalizations, particularly if access to mental health services remains low.

Title: Why and When to Get a Bivalent Covid-19 Booster
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The original COVID-19 boosters effectively prevented severe illness and hospitalization during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the emergence of the highly transmissible omicron variant and its subvariants evaded existing immunity, prompting the development of an updated booster called the bivalent booster. The bivalent booster vaccine contains the original vaccine strain and a strain derived from the BA.5 omicron variant to maximize protection against severe disease and infection. It is recommended for individuals aged 6 months and older who have completed their primary COVID-19 vaccine series, with a waiting period of at least two months for those aged 5 and older, and at least three months for those under 5. According to the CDC, individuals who have had COVID-19 should also receive the bivalent booster, preferably at least three months after infection. This booster aims to provide long-term protection, but the emergence of new variants may require future updates. Virologist Andy Pekosz emphasizes the importance of the bivalent booster for individuals who have received two initial doses and two booster shots, as it offers better protection against currently circulating variants. He also recommends that children and teens who received the original vaccine and a booster get the bivalent booster after four to six months to enhance long-term immunity. The side effects of the bivalent booster are similar to those of the original booster, and it is safe to get it at the same time as the flu shot. The FDA's data suggests that the bivalent vaccine induces a better immune response against the omicron variant compared to the original booster. Vaccine-induced immunity is safer and more effective in protecting against severe disease compared to immunity from infection alone. Individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 should still receive the bivalent booster to strengthen their immune response and develop long-term immunity. In conclusion, the bivalent COVID-19 booster is recommended for individuals aged 6 months and older to enhance protection against severe disease and infection caused by the evolving variants of the virus. It is safe, effective, and can be administered alongside the flu shot to provide comprehensive protection.

Title: Brief on Primary Care Part 2: Factors Affecting Primary Care Capacity in Ontario for Pandemic Response and Recovery
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care in Ontario, Canada, and how it has changed the practice and capacity of primary care. The pandemic has resulted in the deferral or delay of some preventive and ongoing services, leading to patients presenting to primary care with more acute and complex concerns. This has increased the workload and complexity of care for primary care clinicians (PCCs), affecting their capacity and accessibility. One of the key factors affecting primary care provision is health human resources (HHR). The aging population and the retirement of family physicians have led to a decline in the number of PCCs providing comprehensive care. Additionally, an increasing number of family physicians are shifting to focused scopes of practice, further reducing the availability of comprehensive primary care. The pandemic has also exacerbated burnout rates among family physicians, with many reporting working beyond capacity. These factors are expected to impact the ability of Ontario's primary care sector to support universal patient attachment. Different models of primary care, such as patient enrolment models (PEMs) and team-based care, have played a role in supporting pandemic response and recovery. PEMs provide formal attachment to a primary care professional or team, improving continuity of care and access. However, the limited availability of interprofessional teams in Ontario's primary care sector affects the ability to meet the complex health and social needs of certain populations, such as low-income, urban, and new immigrant patients. The article also highlights the importance of infrastructure in supporting coordinated and integrated primary care. The lack of a central registry of PCCs or clinics in Ontario impairs communication and coordination within the primary care sector. The emergence of Ontario Health Teams (OHTs) aims to address this issue by creating clinically and fiscally accountable groups of clinicians and organizations. Overall, the article emphasizes the critical role of primary care in the COVID-19 response and the need to address HHR constraints, support different models of care, and improve infrastructure to enhance primary care provision during the pandemic and beyond. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts can be considered: The aging population and the retirement of family physicians may result in a shortage of primary care providers, impacting access to care and potentially increasing hospitalizations. The decline in comprehensive primary care and the increase in focused scopes of practice may lead to a rise in hospitalizations for conditions that could have been managed in primary care settings. Burnout and high workload among family physicians can affect the quality of care and may result in delayed diagnoses or inadequate management of chronic conditions, potentially increasing hospitalizations. Limited access to primary care for certain populations, such as low-income and new immigrant patients, can lead to unmet health needs and potentially higher hospitalization rates. Strengthening primary care infrastructure and coordination, such as through the development of OHTs, can help improve access to timely and integrated care, potentially reducing the need for hospitalizations.

Title: Adding COVID-19 to ‘designated diseases’ could boost vaccine uptake among children
Publisher: theconversation.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the changing impact of COVID-19 on children and the urgent need to increase vaccine uptake among minors to prevent severe infections, hospitalizations, and long COVID. While early in the pandemic, children were believed to be less susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections, emerging research suggests that their susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased. This is evident from a study in British Columbia's Lower Mainland, which showed a dramatic rise in infections among those under 19, consistent with estimates in other parts of Canada. The article highlights the low vaccine uptake among minors in Ontario, especially in the 5-11 age group and those under 5, despite recommendations from the Ontario government and the availability of approved vaccines. It argues that adding COVID-19 to the list of "designated diseases" in Ontario's Immunization of School Pupils Act could help address this issue, even though it would not make vaccination mandatory for school entry. The article also explores the complex nature of vaccine hesitancy among parents, suggesting that most are not anti-vaxxers but are selective and cautious about newer vaccines. It highlights the potential effectiveness of targeted vaccination campaigns and discusses the regulatory scheme in Ontario aimed at increasing the protection of children's health. Key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Emerging research indicates an increase in both the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children over the course of the pandemic. The study from British Columbia's Lower Mainland showcases a surge in childhood infections with the Omicron variant, consistent with trends in other parts of Canada. Increased infections among children will lead to a higher number of severe cases, including hospitalizations and deaths, especially for those with co-morbidities. Low vaccine uptake among minors, particularly in the 5-11 and under-5 age groups, leaves a significant portion of the pediatric population vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Long COVID is also a concern for children, as it can cause damage to the lungs, brains, and other health problems.
