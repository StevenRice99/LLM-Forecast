Title: FDA Declines Authorization of Fluvoxamine SSRI for COVID Treatment

Posted: 4 days ago
In Ontario, Canada, the drug fluvoxamine has been approved by COVID-19 Advisory for usage if other treatments are unavailable.
The FDA declined authorization of fluvoxamine as a treatment for COVID-19 due to insufficient evidence of effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and severe disease.
A trial in Brazil showed that patients taking fluvoxamine had a 32% lower likelihood of needing hospitalization or emergency care.
In Canada, Ontario's COVID-19 Advisory recommends using fluvoxamine if other treatments are unavailable, but prefers treatments like sotrovimab and remdesivir.
