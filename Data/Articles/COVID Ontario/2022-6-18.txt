Title: Suspension of Senate COVID-19 vaccination requirement
Publisher: Senate of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The Steering Committee of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets, and Administration (CIBA) has decided to suspend the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for Senate workplaces, with the change taking effect on June 20, 2022. This decision was made due to high vaccination rates among Senate staff (around 97-98%), a decrease in COVID-19 cases, and the relaxation of vaccine mandates in Ontario and Quebec. While the vaccination requirement is being lifted, preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and contact tracing for confirmed cases will remain in place in the Senate, which will continue to adhere to public health guidance. This decision suggests that COVID-19 hospitalizations are expected to remain manageable, given the high vaccination rates and decreasing case numbers.

The WHO has released the third version of its mass gathering COVID-19 risk assessment tool, incorporating the latest scientific evidence and guidance. The tool now includes eight tabs covering various aspects of risk assessment and mitigation, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, vaccines, variants of concern, ventilation, and risk communication strategies. The revision emphasizes physical distancing, surveillance testing, and travel restrictions while de-emphasizing venue cleaning and personal protective equipment (PPE), except for mask usage and quality. The risk evaluation and mitigation sections are linked to help users understand and address potential risks. The risk communication pillar has been strengthened using the principles of risk communication and community engagement and infodemic management. This tool can assist event organizers and public health authorities in assessing and managing COVID-19 risks during mass gatherings, contributing to more informed decision-making and safety measures.

Title: Long COVID: Long-Term Effects of COVID-19
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the long-term effects of COVID-19, which can last for months and cause various health problems. While mild or moderate COVID-19 cases usually resolve within two weeks, some individuals experience lingering symptoms even after the initial illness has subsided. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID as the persistence or recurrence of symptoms three months after the initial infection. These symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive issues. The article highlights that while certain risk factors increase the likelihood of a severe COVID-19 bout, there is no clear link between these factors and long-term complications. Long COVID can affect individuals who had mild symptoms, although those with more severe initial illness tend to have more long-term impairments. SARS-CoV-2 can cause damage to multiple organs, including the lungs, heart, nervous system, kidneys, and liver. Mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, may also arise due to the impact of the illness and intensive care treatment. Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death. While breakthrough infections can occur, research suggests that vaccination likely lowers the risk of long COVID. The article also discusses various long-term symptoms, such as breathing issues, heart problems, kidney damage, loss of taste and smell, neurologic problems, cognitive impairment, and mental health issues. These symptoms can have a significant impact on daily functioning and may require ongoing medical care. Additionally, the article mentions the challenges faced by healthcare systems in managing the large number of patients with long-term COVID-19 symptoms, especially when compounded by the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. Overall, the article provides an overview of the diverse and lasting effects of COVID-19, highlighting the need for ongoing research and medical support for those affected.

Title: Asian Canadians felt unsafe due to discrimination linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, study shows
Publisher: Dal News
Trusted: False

The article discusses the rise in discrimination and hate crimes against people of Asian descent, particularly in Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights how people of Asian descent have been blamed for the pandemic and how this has led to both verbal and physical abuse. The article presents the findings of a study conducted by researchers at Dalhousie University, who interviewed 32 Asian Canadians about their experiences during the pandemic. Here are the key findings and important facts from the article: All participants in the study experienced discrimination or witnessed it during the pandemic, indicating a widespread issue. The discrimination often took the form of verbal abuse, harassment, or physical attacks, sometimes resulting in serious injuries or even death. Participants reported feeling anxious, depressed, angry, and distressed due to the discrimination they faced, which also affected their mental and social health. The racism and discrimination were unexpected and unpredictable, leaving people stressed and exhausted, and causing them to feel unsafe in public spaces. Many participants felt that politicians and the media played a crucial role in enabling discrimination through their rhetoric and misinformation. This included the use of terms like "China virus" or "Kung flu" by former U.S. President Donald Trump, which was seen as deliberately misleading and triggering. The study highlights the responsibility of politicians and the media to decry and dismantle racism and scapegoating, especially during times of crisis. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, also expressed concern about the "tsunami of hate" unleashed by the pandemic and urged governments to strengthen measures to combat xenophobia and discrimination. The article also mentions the protective role of educational, linguistic, professional, and economic privilege, which shielded some Asian Canadians from the worst forms of racism and discrimination. Despite the discrimination and fear, many Asian Canadians in the study still felt a strong sense of belonging to Canadian society and felt connected to their Asian Canadian communities. While the article does not directly forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it highlights the mental health impacts of discrimination, which could potentially lead to a need for increased mental health services and support for affected communities. Additionally, the article underscores the importance of responsible messaging from politicians and the media, as misinformation and scapegoating can have serious consequences for public safety and trust.

Title: COVID-19: Canada to update its ‘fully-vaccinated’ definition - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The Canadian government plans to update its definition of being "fully vaccinated" against COVID-19, moving away from the previous focus on two doses of an approved vaccine. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's top doctor, has emphasized that vaccine efficiency wanes over time, dropping to 20% or lower six months after the second dose. As such, she recommends using the phrase "up to date" with COVID-19 vaccines instead of emphasizing a specific number of doses. Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that two doses are no longer sufficient for adequate protection. The policy change is expected to take several weeks or months to implement, and the ministers warned that vaccine mandates could return if the situation changes or a new variant of concern emerges. Duclos also highlighted plans to encourage more Canadians to get vaccinated and boosted during the summer months when cases and hospitalizations are expected to be lower.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fraser Health, a health authority in Canada, formed a unique team called the Long-term Care Deployment Team to specifically address outbreaks in long-term care facilities and protect the vulnerable residents who lived there. This team consisted of 200 licensed practical nurses, community health workers, and healthcare assistants, who provided crucial support to overwhelmed long-term care facilities. They worked tirelessly, often being deployed into high-stress and challenging situations where residents and staff were sick and scared. During the pre-vaccination waves of COVID-19, the team supported up to 40 long-term care facilities simultaneously, providing around 4,000 care hours each week. Their dedication and courage were recognized with a special award, the Above and Beyond Best in Health Care Merit Award, for their exemplary pandemic response. The team continues to provide support to long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, playing a vital role in the pandemic response and helping to reduce hospitalizations among vulnerable long-term care residents.
