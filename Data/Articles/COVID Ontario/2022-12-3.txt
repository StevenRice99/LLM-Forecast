Title: Pandemics radicalise and the COVID-19 outbreak is no exception
Publisher: Al Jazeera English
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, causing 6.6 million deaths and 643 million infections. It has also influenced political and social upheaval, empowering right-wing populist politicians and extremist groups. However, there has also been a wave of progressive activism in response. The pandemic, along with other global challenges such as climate change, has pushed people towards radical approaches, whether progressive or totalitarian. The author draws parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and the 1918-20 H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu. The Spanish flu killed between 50 and 100 million people and infected 500 million worldwide. The critical lesson from the 1918 pandemic is the importance of transparency and trust between authorities and the public. However, during both outbreaks, many leaders downplayed the severity of the virus or lied, leading to an atmosphere of distrust and misinformation. The Spanish flu pandemic, along with World War I, led to economic recession, civil strife, and the rise of far-right movements. It also had unintended consequences, such as boosting first-wave feminism in the US as more white women joined the workforce. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by signs of fascist resurgence in the West, including the January 6 insurrection in the US and the rise of far-right political parties in Europe. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also encouraged progressive political action. This includes strong voter turnout for center-left candidates, labor actions, and mass protests against government repression and COVID-19 policies in various countries. The pandemic has also led to labor disruptions in critical sectors worldwide. The key difference in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the shift to online organizing and activism. This has allowed younger generations to combine in-person and online efforts to defeat regressive forces in elections. It remains to be seen whether this mobilization will ultimately prevent civil unrest or push countries closer to disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with other global challenges, has already pushed people to dream of and work towards a better world.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
An independent report on British Columbia's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has been released, offering 26 recommendations for improvement. Overall, the report praises the province's response but identifies areas where it could have done better. The report found that B.C. had less restrictive public health measures, the highest increase in program spending, and slightly higher vaccination rates compared to other populous provinces. It also had lower COVID-19 infection and death rates. Economically, B.C. fared well, with employment recovering to pre-pandemic levels by July 2021. The report highlights the need for better preparation and transparency in decision-making, particularly regarding data usage and coordination with First Nations. It recommends increasing transparency in public health decisions and establishing formal advisory groups to support these processes. The report also addresses the issue of trust in government, which was high during the pandemic until August 2022 but has since declined. It suggests finding ways to rebuild trust to ensure compliance with future restrictive measures if necessary. The province has welcomed the report's findings and is taking action on the recommendations. Modernizing emergency management legislation and updating the provincial pandemic coordination plan are among the steps being taken. The report emphasizes the importance of learning from past experiences to enhance future responses to province-wide emergencies.

Title: Ivermectin shown ineffective in treating COVID-19, according to multi-site study including KU Medical Center
Publisher: University of Kansas Medical Center
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could aid in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Researchers from the University of Kansas Medical Center collaborated with other institutions across the US as part of the ACTIV initiative to study the effectiveness of ivermectin in treating COVID-19. The double-blind ACTIV-6 trial enrolled 1,800 participants who received either ivermectin or a placebo at their residences. The results showed that ivermectin did not significantly improve outcomes for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The median recovery time for those taking ivermectin was 12 days, compared to 13 days for the placebo group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in hospitalizations or deaths between the two groups. As a result, the researchers concluded that ivermectin should not be used as a treatment for COVID-19. Ivermectin is an oral medication first introduced as an animal de-wormer and later approved for human use. It gained attention as a potential COVID-19 treatment when early laboratory studies showed it could kill the coronavirus. However, subsequent clinical trials, including ACTIV-6 and TOGETHER in Brazil, have failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in treating COVID-19. This information suggests that ivermectin is not an effective measure for reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations, and forecasting models should not include it as a factor influencing hospitalization rates.

Title: Commuting in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: What changed from 2016 to 2021?
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
In 2021, the number of Canadians commuting to work decreased by 2.8 million compared to 2016, a significant drop of almost 18%. This decrease can be attributed to two main factors: a decline in car and public transit commuters and a rise in people working from home. Firstly, there was an overall reduction in commuters using traditional modes of transportation. Approximately 11 million people commuted by car, truck, or van in 2021, a decrease of 13.2% from 2016. Similarly, public transit use also saw a substantial drop, with 1 million commuters in 2021, representing a shift away from pre-pandemic commuting patterns. However, the most notable change was the dramatic increase in the number of people working from home. In 2021, 4.2 million Canadians worked from home, an over threefold increase from the 2016 level of 7.4%. This shift towards remote work had a significant impact on overall commuting patterns and helped reduce the number of commuters on roads and public transportation. The decrease in commuting numbers can also be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely played a role in changing work patterns and encouraging remote work arrangements. When forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, these commuting data can provide valuable insights. Firstly, the decrease in commuters may result in lower transmission rates in the general population, as fewer people are in close contact during their daily travels. This could potentially lead to a decrease in hospitalizations. However, the increase in remote work may also impact healthcare worker availability. With more people working from home, there could be a higher likelihood of healthcare workers being unavailable due to self-isolation or caring for sick family members. Therefore, these commuting trends should be considered when forecasting healthcare capacity and planning for potential surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Amid respiratory virus surge, Ontario paediatric infectious diseases experts encourage COVID-19 and flu vaccinations for children under five
Publisher: LHSC
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Pediatric infectious disease experts from several hospitals in Ontario, Canada, have issued a joint statement recommending both COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations for children aged 6 months to 5 years. The statement comes as the respiratory virus season starts early and impacts young children, putting a strain on children's hospitals and healthcare providers. The experts encourage COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations as one of the tools to mitigate the impact of the viral season, along with hand hygiene, masks in indoor settings, and staying home when sick. They highlight the low COVID-19 vaccination rates in younger children, with only 7.3% of Ontarian children aged 6 months to 5 years having received a first dose and 2.3% being fully vaccinated. In contrast, older children and youth have higher vaccination rates, with 52.5% of children aged 5-11 having received at least one dose and 83.4% of youth aged 12-17. The low vaccination rates in younger children are concerning as they have a higher risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. The hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 is 202.2 per 100,000 children in Ontario. Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine in children under 5 are similar to those of other vaccines given at this age and are generally mild. No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been observed in this age group in Ontario. The experts emphasize the importance of additional mitigation efforts as viral circulation is expected to increase. Caregivers interested in vaccinating their children are advised to speak with their primary care provider, local pharmacist, or book online. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts may be important to consider: Low COVID-19 vaccination rates in younger children (6 months to 5 years) can lead to higher hospitalization rates as this age group is at higher risk. The hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 in Ontario due to COVID-19 is 202.2 per 100,000 children. Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine in children under 5 are generally mild and similar to other vaccines, which may encourage higher vaccination rates and reduce hospitalizations. Additional mitigation efforts, such as influenza vaccination, hand hygiene, masks, and staying home when sick, can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory viruses on healthcare systems. The experts anticipate that viral circulation will increase, which could lead to more hospitalizations if mitigation efforts are not implemented effectively.

Title: Helpful guidelines if you test positive or negative for COVID-19
Publisher: Mayo Clinic
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article provides guidelines for individuals who are waiting for COVID-19 test results or have already received positive or negative test results. Here are the key points: If you test positive with a PCR test, isolate for at least five days, and end isolation if you are fever-free for 24 hours without medication and your symptoms improve. Day zero is the first day of symptoms. Asymptomatic individuals should also isolate for at least five days and wear a mask around others. Inform your healthcare team about a positive test result so it can be documented. After isolation, wear a surgical/procedural mask in public settings. Stay home if you still have a fever, regardless of the number of isolation days. You may need a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR or at-home antigen test) to return to work or school, depending on the requirements of your organization and local guidelines. If you test negative with a PCR test and do not have any symptoms, you are likely not infected. For at-home antigen tests, trust a positive result if you have symptoms and isolate accordingly. A negative result could be a false negative, so consider a lab-based PCR test, especially if symptoms persist or worsen. Isolation guidelines for a positive antigen test are the same as for a PCR test. You may need a negative test to return to work/regular activities, and you should inform your local healthcare team. You don't need to retest after five days if you are symptom-free or fever-free for 24 hours without medication, unless required by your workplace or school. Household members without symptoms do not need to be tested unless they develop symptoms. These guidelines can help individuals navigate the appropriate actions to take after receiving COVID-19 test results, contributing to the overall management of the pandemic and potentially reducing the spread of the virus.

Title: Twitter ends its ban on covid misinformation
Publisher: The Washington Post
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Twitter's decision to no longer enforce its policy against COVID-19 misinformation has experts worried about the spread of false information that could have serious consequences for public health. Twitter introduced the policy in 2020 and has since removed over 100,000 pieces of content and suspended thousands of accounts for violating it. While the policy was praised by public health experts, Twitter has also struggled to accurately police misinformation, and some factual information about COVID-19 was incorrectly labeled as misinformation. The company's new owner, Elon Musk, has decided to shift the responsibility for policing misinformation to users through the Birdwatch program, which allows users to rate and correct tweets. However, this system has already been gamed by users who have added incorrect information about COVID-19 to tweets. Experts worry that the combination of this new system with Musk's plan to sell blue check marks to anyone willing to pay will lead to the promotion of dangerous and baseless ideas about COVID-19, especially to vulnerable populations. The move comes as COVID-19 hospitalizations are already rising in some parts of the country, and public health experts worry that the spread of misinformation could make it harder to predict and control future surges of the virus.

Title: Getting Your Flu Shot or COVID-19 Vaccine After You’re No Longer Sick
Publisher: First Nations Health Authority
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: It is respiratory virus season in British Columbia, and that includes viruses such as the common cold, influenza (flu), and COVID-19. While there is no cure for the common cold, staying home, getting rest, and practicing good hygiene can help with recovery and prevent spread. For the flu and COVID-19, annual flu shots and staying up-to-date with COVID-19 booster doses are recommended to prevent serious illness. Even if someone has already had the flu or COVID-19, it is still important to get vaccinated. Vaccines boost immunity and provide stronger protection against these respiratory illnesses. For those who have recovered from the flu or COVID-19, it is safe to get vaccinated as soon as possible, although recent research suggests that waiting three months after a positive COVID-19 test may result in better protection. It is important to note that the flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19 and vice versa. However, individuals can get both vaccines at the same appointment. Taking preventive measures such as wearing a mask in crowded places, practicing good hand hygiene, and avoiding touching the face can also reduce the chances of getting sick. Overall, getting vaccinated is the best way to avoid serious illness from the flu or COVID-19. Vaccines are safe, effective, and free, and they play a crucial role in protecting individuals and communities during respiratory virus season.

Title: Perfectionist teens reported more depression and stress during COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A recent study published in the journal Child Development investigated the impact of perfectionism on teens’ mental health and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that teen perfectionists experienced a decline in their mental health and an increase in stress levels compared to their non-perfectionist peers. Perfectionism is characterized by a rigid requirement for absolute perfection and is associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, stress, disordered eating, and anxiety. Psychology researchers identify two types of perfectionism: self-oriented and socially prescribed. Self-oriented perfectionists demand perfection from themselves, while socially prescribed perfectionists believe that others expect perfection from them. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government-mandated lockdowns have had a significant impact on teens' lives, interrupting their schooling and isolating them from friends and family. The study assessed 187 adolescents in Ontario, Canada, and found that depressive symptoms and stress decreased slightly from before the pandemic to the first lockdown, but then increased during the second lockdown. The findings suggest that teen perfectionists are more vulnerable to mental health issues during the pandemic, with self-oriented perfectionists experiencing higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, teenagers who believed that others demanded perfection from them reported higher levels of depression and stress. Overall, the article highlights the importance of recognizing that teen perfectionists may be struggling behind a mask of perfection and may need support to cope with the challenges of the pandemic.

Title: A COVID-19 model incorporating variants, vaccination, waning immunity, and population behavior
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article presents a model that simulates COVID-19 transmission dynamics and forecasts hospitalizations by incorporating factors such as vaccination rates, variant transmissibility, and behavioral changes. The model was applied to five countries (Germany, India, Japan, South Africa, and the United States) and successfully reproduced infection trends over two years. Key points: The model estimated actual cases by adjusting for underreporting, with a scaling factor ranging from 20 actual cases per reported case to 2. Population immunity was assessed by considering vaccination and infection-induced immunity, waning immunity, reinfection risks, and variant prevalence. Average immunity increased with vaccine distribution until late 2021 when the Omicron variant emerged, causing a decay in immunity due to reduced vaccine protection and increased reinfection risk. The model estimated the transmissibility of variants and their initial spread dates. For example, the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants were estimated to be 1.8, 4.2, and 21.8 times more transmissible than the original strain in the US. Sensitivity analysis showed that small changes in variant parameters significantly impacted simulation results, emphasizing the model's ability to estimate these parameters accurately. A vaccine allocation study in the US context revealed that prioritizing the first vaccine dose over the second dose by a ratio of 2:1 resulted in stable pandemic trajectories. However, below a critical threshold, infectious cases proliferated. Regarding booster doses, prioritizing them over first and second doses reduced the peak in infectious cases until a booster dose proportion of 0.5, after which infectious cases increased due to insufficient base immunity in the population. In conclusion, the model provides valuable insights into COVID-19 transmission dynamics and can be a useful tool for forecasting hospitalizations and guiding vaccine allocation strategies.
