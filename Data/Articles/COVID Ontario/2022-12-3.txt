The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Only 7.3% of Ontarian children aged 6 months to 5 years have received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 2.3% are fully vaccinated. This age group has the highest rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19, with 1,441 children aged 0-4 years old hospitalized for COVID-19 in Ontario, corresponding to a rate of 202.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 children. The experts anticipate viral circulation will continue to increase, emphasizing the need for additional mitigation efforts such as influenza vaccination, hand hygiene, masks in indoor settings, and staying home when sick. These values suggest that the low vaccination rate among young children and the high hospitalization rate in this age group could contribute to an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
