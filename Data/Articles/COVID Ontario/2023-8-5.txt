Title: Countering the “wrong story”: a Participatory Action Research approach to developing COVID-19 vaccine information videos with First Nations leaders in Australia
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article describes a collaborative effort between First Nations leaders, healthcare professionals, and communication experts in the Northern Territory of Australia to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among First Nations communities. The project resulted in the creation of 16 informational videos in 8 First Nations languages and English, which were well-received by the target audience. Key findings include: Vaccine hesitancy among First Nations communities was driven by misinformation, confusion, and fear, with many questioning the need for vaccination due to the absence of COVID-19 in the NT and expressing concerns about the vaccine's safety and rapid development. To counter these concerns, the team co-designed informative videos that addressed common questions and misconceptions. The videos emphasized the importance of vaccine safety and provided personalized messages from trusted community members, including Elders. The inclusion of First Nations languages and the involvement of Elders in the co-design process were crucial for the success of the intervention. The use of recognizable presenters with strong health and cultural values, as well as localized imagery, helped build trust and ensure the messages were meaningful and accessible. Social media analytics revealed that sponsored Facebook posts were significantly more effective than organic sharing in reaching a wider audience at a low cost. The article emphasizes the importance of co-designing culturally appropriate and locally relevant health messages to address vaccine hesitancy and improve health outcomes in First Nations communities. This initiative provides valuable insights into effective strategies for addressing vaccine hesitancy and improving health communication with First Nations communities. By involving community leaders and utilizing trusted messengers, the project was able to build trust and provide accessible, culturally sensitive information. These findings can inform future public health campaigns and contribute to more effective COVID-19 vaccine uptake and health promotion efforts in First Nations communities.

Title: Why COVID-19 May Cause Some People To Cough Up Blood
Publisher: Health.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: Coughing up blood-tinged mucus due to COVID-19 is rare but not abnormal, and it occurs in only 3.3% of COVID-19 cases. Violent or excessive coughing can irritate the throat and lungs, leading to small amounts of blood in the mucus. While this symptom is usually not serious, it can sometimes indicate viral pneumonia, a complication of COVID-19. In such cases, consulting a healthcare provider is advised, as they may recommend cough suppressants to reduce violent coughing. Coughing up blood can originate from the throat or lungs and has various causes, including injuries, illnesses, and infections. It is important to seek immediate medical attention if coughing up blood is accompanied by severe symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing up large amounts of blood (more than a few teaspoons). The article also mentions other possible causes of coughing up blood, such as bronchiectasis, bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, lung infections, lupus, pulmonary aspiration, edema, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. Additionally, it highlights the possibility of bacterial infections, as indicated by blood-tinged mucus from the nose.

Title: The illusion and implications of ‘just following the science’ COVID-19 messaging
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the role of politicians and scientific advisors in decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing for more transparency and accountability. Here's a summary: Commentators in Canada are calling for an independent public inquiry into the country's COVID-19 response, including an examination of how politicians' messaging deflected responsibility onto scientific evidence and experts. The phrase "following the science" was commonly used by politicians in Canada, Australia, and the UK during the pandemic, implying that their policies were based solely on scientific advice. However, the article argues that this rhetoric can be misleading as scientific evidence is often contested and evolving, and it should not be the only factor in decision-making. Politicians are elected to balance multiple priorities and interests. The "following the science" message may have been used to deflect responsibility from politicians for controversial decisions and onto scientific advisors, which is not in line with the principles of a mature democracy. Misleading messages about the role of scientific advice can undermine public trust in scientific advisors, especially when decisions change or are controversial. The lack of transparency around decision-making in Canada made it difficult for citizens to understand the role of scientific advice, potentially contributing to a decline in trust in federal and provincial Chief Medical Officers of Health (CMOHs) over time. To rebuild trust and improve pandemic response, the article calls for an independent national inquiry and more transparent messaging from politicians about how and why decisions are made. The article highlights the complex interplay between politics and science in pandemic decision-making and emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability to maintain public trust and effectively address public health challenges.

Title: External review found military's COVID-19 vaccine policy violated Charter of Rights
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A Canadian military tribunal, the Military Grievances External Review Committee, has found that the COVID-19 vaccine policy of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) violated its members' Charter rights. The committee reviewed 157 grievances filed over the policy, which took effect in fall 2021 and required CAF members to be vaccinated or face release. By the time the requirement ended in October 2022, 299 people had been released and 108 left voluntarily. The committee concluded that the policy infringed on life, liberty, and security of the person, and that the limitations on these rights were not in accordance with fundamental justice principles. It also found that the limitations were not justified under reasonable limits allowed by the Charter. The committee's analysis, released in mid-July, determined that while a vaccine mandate was justifiable due to the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing severe illness and death from COVID-19, the policy unfairly distinguished between those who could not get vaccinated and those who chose not to. The committee also found the policy to be "overly broad" and "disproportionate" in its implementation. It recommended rescinding administrative actions against those who refused the vaccine and allowing one griever to re-enroll in the military. However, the chief of the defence staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, is not obligated to follow the committee's recommendations and will make the final decision in these cases. The Department of Defence stated that the CAF's decisions on vaccination are based on up-to-date medical evidence, the federal posture, and the need for operational readiness. It noted that over 96% of CAF members are vaccinated against COVID-19, and that members routinely receive vaccines for other diseases before deployment. Meanwhile, a lawyer specializing in military cases, retired Lt.-Col. Rory Fowler, criticized the military's approach to releasing unvaccinated members, calling it cowardly. He predicted that Eyre's office would reject parts of the committee's findings and recommendations, leading to litigation through judicial reviews. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider vaccination rates, as vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness. The high vaccination rate of over 96% among CAF members may help reduce hospitalizations within this group. However, the broader impact on hospitalizations will depend on various factors, including vaccination rates in the general population, the prevalence of new variants, and the availability and uptake of booster shots.

Title: COVID-19 had hard lessons on the importance of equity in population health research
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the failure of global and national leaders, including Canada, to prioritize equity in their response, particularly regarding vulnerable populations. The pandemic's toll includes nearly seven million deaths and over 760 million cases worldwide. To understand the impact on population health research, interviews with 35 global and public health experts were conducted, revealing the need for improved public health training, reforms to prioritize equity, and adequate funding. Equity was not a priority during the initial waves of COVID-19 in high-income countries like Canada, instead focusing on containing the virus and reducing deaths. The pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, affecting front-line workers, seniors, women, racialized communities, Indigenous peoples, and those with disabilities disproportionately. Inadequate funding and a shift in focus away from non-communicable disease research were also detrimental. However, COVID-19 prompted collaboration across disciplines and a renewed appreciation for population and public health. Key recommendations include adopting a "One Health" approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health, and conducting health equity impact assessments of health decisions. To promote equity in global health and population health research, universities should enhance equity training for future leaders and practitioners. Amendments to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act should explicitly address health equity. Adequate funding is essential to ensure accountable health outcomes across population groups. Failing to address these equity considerations will result in repeated disparities and heightened risks for vulnerable populations in future crises.

A tribunal has found that a COVID-19 vaccine policy from November 2021 violated the Charter rights of Armed Forces members, resulting in the release of 299 people and another 108 leaving voluntarily. The Military Grievances External Review Committee has recommended that one of the released individuals be allowed to re-enrol. While the recommendations are not binding, they may influence the chief of the defence staff's final decision on the 157 filed grievances. This decision could have implications for COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts as it may impact the vaccination rates and overall health of the Armed Forces community.

Title: Frequently Asked Questions: COVID-19 vaccines
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: High-priority individuals for protection against COVID-19 include older adults over 75 years, those with comorbidities aged 60-75, immunocompromised individuals aged 6 months and above, and pregnant people. These groups should receive an additional booster dose as per the recommended timeline to maintain protection. PAHO/WHO recommends that everyone who has had COVID-19, regardless of symptom severity, receive all recommended vaccine doses to strengthen their immune system. Individuals currently infected with COVID-19 can be vaccinated once they are no longer contagious to avoid spreading the virus during vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines, to save time and improve protection. Pregnant people are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and are recommended to receive three doses and a booster within 6 months by the WHO. Breastfeeding mothers can also be vaccinated as the vaccine does not pose a risk to the infant and offers health benefits to both mother and child. Individuals with underlying diseases and immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and are advised to receive three doses and boosters as recommended by the WHO. Those diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) can be vaccinated, and no cases of GBS have been linked to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in clinical trials. COVID-19 vaccines are now available for children aged 6 months and above, with specific recommendations varying based on age, health status, and country guidelines. Individuals with allergies or immune system problems should consult a healthcare professional before vaccination for risk assessment but can generally receive the COVID-19 vaccine. These recommendations aim to protect those at highest risk and reduce the burden on healthcare systems, which is crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and managing the pandemic effectively.

Title: What's the future of wastewater testing for COVID-19?
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article highlights the importance of wastewater surveillance as a tool for detecting and tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in communities, and experts are calling for continued vigilance and funding for this initiative. Here are the key points: Wastewater surveillance has been an effective tool for early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks, but current government funding for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater may not continue beyond next year. Experts are advocating for a standardized federal system for wastewater surveillance to replace the current patchwork of programs. COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada are currently declining, but infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch warns that this may be "as good as it gets for a while" and that most parameters are likely to rise again in the fall. Wastewater surveillance can provide early warning signs of rising COVID-19 cases, but the number of testing sites has decreased as the severity of cases has waned, leading to a potential gap in vigilance. A federal strategy for wastewater monitoring is needed to standardize data collection and analysis across different provinces and initiatives. The reduction in wastewater testing highlights a potential complacency in COVID-19 vigilance, despite its effectiveness in detecting community spread and identifying trends. The pandemic prompted experts from various fields to collaborate on wastewater surveillance, demonstrating the power of interdisciplinary cooperation in public health crises. Wastewater testing also highlights health equity issues, as it can provide insights into vulnerable and underserved communities that may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 or other health issues. Wastewater surveillance offers a simple and equitable way to measure disease burden in communities, as it counts everyone who uses the bathroom, regardless of their access to healthcare or testing infrastructure.
