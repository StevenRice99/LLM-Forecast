Title: An interrupted time series analysis of trends in opioid-related emergency department visits from pre-COVID-19 pandemic to pandemic, from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program 
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article presents an analysis of emergency department (ED) visit trends related to opioid use from pre-pandemic through pandemic times using the Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting Program (CHIRPP). Here are the main points and insights:
Key findings: 
1. Pre-pandemic trend: Before the pandemic, there was a clear increasing trend in fentanyl-related visits among 25- to 64-year-olds, but not heroin-related visits.
2. Pandemic impact: The elevated level of fentanyl-related visits during the pandemic did not become steeper than pre-pandemic levels.
3. Sex and age-specific analysis: The study found significant differences in opioid-related ED visit trends by sex and age groups:
Fentanyl-related visits increased immediately at the start of the pandemic among 18- to 24-year-olds.
Heroin-related visits decreased starting before the pandemic among males, but not females.
Adolescents and young adults were particularly impacted at the beginning of the pandemic.
4. Percentage of severe cases: The study found no sustained increase in the severity of opioid-related ED visits during the pandemic.
Insights: 
1. Continuation of pre-pandemic factors: The factors causing opioid-related harms prior to the pandemic (e.g., social and economic vulnerability, mental health, contaminated illicit drug supply) likely continued to play a major role during the pandemic.
2. Importance of sex and age considerations: The study highlights the importance of considering sex and age differences when implementing prevention and intervention measures.
3. Special considerations for adolescents and young adults: The disruption caused by lockdowns had a particular effect on this population, leading to increased substance use and related harms.
Limitations: 
1. Generalizability limited to urban areas: CHIRPP's focus on urban areas may limit the study's generalizability to rural or Indigenous populations.
2. Under-representation of adults: The pediatric focus of CHIRPP hospitals may affect the age distribution in the study, which was partially offset by age-specific analysis.
3. Small sample size: Limited sample size restricted the ability to analyze specific opioids and age/sex groups.
4. Opioid type classification limitations: Uncertainty about opioid types among some cases could have impacted the analysis.
Future work: 
1. Investigating circumstances surrounding opioid-related ED visits: The study suggests that further research should investigate factors like social determinants, substance use disorder treatment access, and health care-seeking behavior during the pandemic.
2. Tailoring prevention and intervention measures: The findings emphasize the importance of considering sex and age differences when designing prevention and intervention strategies to address opioid-related harms.

Title: Health Canada approves 1st RSV vaccine for people 60 and older
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
RSV is not well-tracked in Canada, making it unclear how many people 60 and older are hospitalized or die from RSV. However, experts estimate that hospitalization rates for RSV could be similar to those seen with influenza (12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths annually).
Relevant values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Age group: People 60 and older
Hospitalization rate: Estimated to be similar to influenza (approximately 12,200 hospitalizations annually)
Seasonality: RSV season usually starts in late fall and lasts until spring
Vaccine efficacy: Arexvy vaccine has an 82% efficacy in preventing lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.

Title: B.C. COVID-19 data: Just 76 people in hospital Thursday, lowest total in 2 years
Publisher: CTV News Vancouver
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article reports a low number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in British Columbia (76 as of Thursday), with Interior Health and Northern Health having minimal patients. This is not directly relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. However, the article mentions that Island Health had 29 patients hospitalized, which could be a comparable regional data point for Ontario.
