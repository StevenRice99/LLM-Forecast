This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: A new coronavirus strain, EG.5, has become the dominant variant in the US, responsible for over 17% of new cases in the past two weeks. EG.5 is also increasing globally, with its prevalence nearly doubling from mid-June to mid-July, and has been documented in 45 countries. Although there is currently no evidence of rising cases and deaths or a change in disease severity associated with EG.5, COVID-19 hospitalizations are increasing in the US, with a small uptick since December. Experts warn that this slight summer increase should serve as a wake-up call to treat the virus seriously before winter rolls around. The upcoming fall booster campaign, targeting XBB.1.5, is expected to increase protection against the coronavirus ahead of a potential fall and winter wave. These points are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they highlight the emergence of a new dominant variant, the potential for increased transmission and hospitalizations, and the importance of vaccination efforts to mitigate these risks.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower among immigrant children (53.1%) and adolescents (79.2%) in Ontario, Canada, compared to non-immigrant children and adolescents. The study also found that there were marked variations in vaccination rates within immigrant groups based on region of origin, with the lowest rates observed in immigrants and refugees from East Europe and Central Africa, and the highest rates observed in minors from Southeast Asia. These findings are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that certain populations (immigrant and refugee children and adolescents) may be at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization due to lower vaccination rates. Additionally, the study's findings on the heterogeneity of vaccination rates within immigrant groups can inform targeted public health approaches to improve vaccination coverage and reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations in these populations. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination coverage rates among immigrant children and adolescents (53.1% and 79.2%, respectively) Region of origin-specific vaccination rates (e.g. East Europe and Central Africa: 0.40-0.51; Southeast Asia: 2.68-4.42) Proportion of immigrant and refugee children and adolescents in Ontario (4.8% and 23.4% of children, 9.2% and 19.4% of adolescents)

Title: What's the future of wastewater testing for COVID-19?

Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Wastewater surveillance has been an important tool for detecting COVID-19 outbreaks in communities throughout the pandemic. The number of wastewater testing sites in Ontario has decreased from 170 to 70, and funding for wastewater testing is set to end in March 2024. Experts are calling for a standardized system for wastewater surveillance to bolster and replace the current patchwork system. Wastewater testing can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus before symptoms set in and can provide an early warning system for outbreaks. COVID-19-related hospitalizations in Canada are currently declining, but infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch warns that this is "about as good as it's going to get for a while" and that parameters will likely rise in the fall. Wastewater surveillance can provide valuable data on the presence of the virus in communities, particularly in vulnerable populations, and can help promote health equity. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of wastewater testing sites in Ontario: 70 (down from 170) Funding for wastewater testing: set to end in March 2024 Current trend in COVID-19-related hospitalizations in Canada: declining Expected trend in COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the fall: increasing Importance of wastewater surveillance for detecting outbreaks and promoting health equity: high.
