Title: Significant number of kids in hospital as respiratory illnesses rise
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values for forecasting: Flu season has started earlier than usual, with a spike in influenza cases and a significant number of children being admitted with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia. COVID-19 rates remain high and stable or rising in Ottawa. RSV activity is also high, and health-care institutions are at high risk from respiratory illnesses, expected to remain so until at least March. The number of young children hospitalized with respiratory illnesses is significant, but not as bad as last year. Experts warn that the hospital system may become overwhelmed, similar to last year, and emphasize the importance of vaccination for everyone, not just vulnerable populations. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Early start to flu season High and stable or rising COVID-19 rates High RSV activity Significant number of young children hospitalized with respiratory illnesses High risk of hospital overwhelm These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may increase in the coming weeks, particularly among young children, and that the hospital system may become overwhelmed.

Title: Flu signals rising in Ottawa to match high COVID, RSV trends
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 numbers are rising or stable, with very high individual trends. Flu activity is now high, similar to RSV. 17 more COVID deaths were reported locally. The average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 has fallen slightly to 71, with 4 patients in ICU. The weekly average test positivity rate has dropped to about 18%, which is still considered very high. There are 43 active COVID outbreaks, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals, with a very high number of new outbreaks. Only 18% of residents over age 4 had a COVID vaccine dose in the previous six months, with nearly 100,000 doses administered in Ottawa over the last four weeks. Experts recommend vaccination, particularly for people 80+, and expect flu and COVID spread to peak in the next few weeks. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa, and potentially in other parts of Ontario, may increase in the coming weeks due to rising case numbers, high flu activity, and low vaccination rates, particularly among vulnerable populations.

Title: Growing toll of COVID-19 on hospitals & population health should concern us
Publisher: Policy Note
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased 19% in Canada (excluding Quebec) and 7% in BC between 2021-22 and 2022-23. The average length of hospital stay increased 52% in Canada and 64% in BC (almost double the increase in Ontario). The estimated total cost of hospitalizations increased 16% in Canada and 5% in BC. Ontario, the Maritime provinces, and Newfoundland and Labrador saw the greatest increase in the number of patients hospitalized and hospital costs. The article highlights the limitations of official COVID-19 hospitalization data, particularly in BC, where low testing rates and a high testing threshold underestimate COVID-19 cases. The article also discusses the long-term effects of COVID-19, including the risk of vascular and neurologic complications, and the need for a "vaccines-plus" strategy to reduce transmission. The article calls for a paradigm shift in how government and public health officials respond to the ongoing burden of COVID-19, including clear public education, improving indoor air quality, rapid testing, and provision of paid sick leave. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the current trends and burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, as well as the need for a comprehensive strategy to reduce transmission and mitigate the impact of the virus on population health.

Title: COVID-19 hospitalizations higher than last December, MOH warns
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the values most important for forecasting: Wastewater levels of COVID-19 in Ottawa are higher than this time last year, indicating a potential increase in cases. The seven-day average for patients in hospital because of COVID-19 was 79 for the week of Nov. 21-27, which is higher than the average number of hospitalizations for the same period last year (27). Older adults (people over 60 and especially over age 80) remain the most vulnerable population, with the highest rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. A significant number of older adults' immunity against COVID-19 is waning since they've not been infected by the virus and their last vaccine dose was more than six months to a year ago, indicating a potential increase in hospitalizations among this age group. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may increase, particularly among older adults, and highlight the importance of vaccination efforts to mitigate this trend.

Title: COVID-19 and flu set to peak over holiday season in Ontario, Moore urges vaccinations
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Current COVID-19 hospitalizations: 1,700 people, with 100 requiring intensive care. COVID-19 activity is on the rise, expected to peak over the holiday season. Only 13% of the eligible population (1.8 million Ontarians) have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine, with 40% of people over 65 vaccinated. 60% of adults over 65 are not protected against COVID-19 and influenza through immunizations, which is a concern. Flu activity is also on the rise, expected to follow a traditional pattern and peak over the holiday season. No public health measures are planned, but risk communication and access to medications will continue. The system is prepared for a surge, but there are concerns about the extra burden on hospitals due to influenza. These values can inform forecasting models about the current state of COVID-19 hospitalizations, vaccination rates, and the expected impact of the holiday season on hospitalizations.
