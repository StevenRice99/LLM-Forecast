Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the findings of a Statistics Canada report on long-term symptoms from COVID-19 infection and the impact on Canadians. Here are the key points: About 11% of Canadian adults, or 3.5 million people, have experienced long-term symptoms from COVID-19, defined as symptoms persisting for three months or longer. 80% of those with long-term symptoms have dealt with them for at least six months, and more than half still have symptoms as of June 2023. The most common long COVID symptoms include brain fog, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Two-thirds of Canadian adults seeking medical help for long-term symptoms feel they haven't received adequate treatment or support. Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the risk and severity of long COVID, according to research. 1 in 5 Canadian adults have had multiple COVID-19 infections, with 45% experiencing one infection, 14% experiencing two, and over 5% having three or more infections. These findings highlight the significant impact of long COVID on Canadians' health and well-being, with many individuals struggling to access adequate care. The high levels of prior infection could also have implications for forecasting future COVID-19 hospitalizations, as repeat infections become more common.

Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article introduces the Covid-19 Policy Response Canadian Tracker (CPRCT), a database that tracks public health measures implemented by Canadian provincial and territorial governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CPRCT records non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as school closures, restrictions on gatherings and travel, and closures of non-essential businesses on a four-level ordinal scale (0-3) for three policy indicators: schools, work, and other. The goal of the dataset is to provide a daily record of public health measures to facilitate mathematical modeling and understand the impact of these measures on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The article highlights the value of the CPRCT for researchers and policymakers, including its ability to eliminate redundancy and overfitting in models and its alignment with age-structured contact estimates. Visual representations of NPI timelines for each province and territory are also included in the repository, providing a snapshot of the restrictions in place from March 2020 to January 2022. The dataset can be used to understand the effectiveness of public health measures and inform future policies and restrictions. Overall, the CPRCT is a valuable tool for analyzing and modeling the impact of public health measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

Title: Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Baloxavir is an antiviral drug that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within two days of illness onset in people at high risk of developing complications. It has also been approved for use in healthy children aged 5-11 years and for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in people aged 5 years and older. Baloxavir has shown superior efficacy compared to placebo and similar efficacy to oseltamivir in reducing the time to improvement of symptoms, especially in patients with influenza B virus infection. However, there are limited data for baloxavir in pregnant people, immunocompromised individuals, and those with severe influenza who are not hospitalized. The combination of baloxavir and neuraminidase inhibitors did not show superior clinical benefits in hospitalized influenza patients compared to neuraminidase inhibitors alone. Baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza by 86% in individuals aged 12 years and older.

Title: 'We're clearly in a wave:' Ontario's COVID-19 wastewater signal is more than double what it was at this time last year
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 viral activity in Ontario, Canada, is more than double what it was last year at this time, based on wastewater data. The province's wastewater signal, which indicates the level of COVID-19 virus in the sewage system, currently stands at 2.1, up from 2.04 last week and 0.98 on the same day last year. This suggests that COVID-19 transmission is on the rise in Ontario. Dr. Fahad Razak, an internist and former scientific director of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Table, notes that the current wave of COVID-19 started in late summer or early fall and continues to rise steeply. The growth in viral activity varies across different regions of the province, with the central west and eastern regions seeing much higher wastewater signals compared to last year. While the wastewater data provides valuable insight, Dr. Razak also points out that other indicators, such as positive PCR tests and hospitalizations, are also at one-year highs. Many people anecdotally know individuals who are currently infected with COVID-19, and respiratory virus season is in full swing. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, has expressed concern about the high number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, with approximately 1,800 people currently in hospital and 100 in intensive care. He also notes that only 13% of the eligible population has received the latest vaccine, including just 40% of those 65 and older, who are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Despite the increase in hospitalizations, the number of people requiring ICU care has not risen sharply, which Dr. Razak attributes to the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing serious illness. He also notes that other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and RSV, are circulating, and that there is likely some overlap in infections. To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, especially during the upcoming holiday season, Dr. Razak recommends masking in crowded settings, rapid testing, and staying up to date with vaccinations. These tools, while not perfect, can help reduce the impact on the healthcare sector and protect older, more at-risk populations. With transmission expected to peak during the holidays, doctors are encouraging individuals to take steps now to reduce the spread to loved ones. This includes masking, testing, and staying home if sick, while also enjoying the holidays and connecting with family and friends. Overall, the article highlights the increase in COVID-19 activity in Ontario and the potential for a challenging respiratory virus season, while also providing recommendations to help reduce the spread and protect vulnerable populations.

Title: COVID school closures dramatically set kids back—here are some solutions
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article argues that COVID-19 school closures have negatively impacted students' academic performance and well-being, particularly disadvantaged children. Research suggests that the educational gap created by school closures may reduce lifetime earnings and harm the economy. Data modeling predicts a global learning loss in the trillions of dollars and reduced lifetime earnings for individuals. In Canada, student achievement has declined post-COVID, with schools closed for extended periods. To mitigate the impacts of learning loss, the article suggests several measures: 1. Maximize in-class learning by minimizing closures due to inclement weather or labor strikes, and utilizing online learning when necessary. 2. Prioritize hiring and rewarding excellent teachers,. 3. Embrace fact-based, content-rich learning methods over “progressive” curriculum fads. 4. Implement standardized testing to fairly and objectively measure student performance and identify areas for improvement. While recognizing that the negative effects of school closures won't be resolved immediately, the article emphasizes the importance of a rigorous return to classroom learning with traditional methods and qualified teachers. These steps are crucial for helping students recover from learning losses and ensuring their future success and well-being.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccines Advice
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article emphasizes the ongoing importance of COVID-19 vaccination, even though the emergency phase of the pandemic is over. Vaccination is crucial for preventing severe disease, reducing hospitalizations, and lowering the risk of new variants emerging. According to WHO's updated recommendations, individuals should consider both their vaccination history and their age and health condition when deciding on vaccination and booster shots. Getting vaccinated, even if one has already recovered from COVID-19, provides hybrid immunity and enhances protection against severe outcomes. Mixing and matching different COVID-19 vaccines is safe and effective. Pregnant women, those planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding mothers are especially encouraged to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their families. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is assured through strict precautions and rigorous clinical trials. While mild side effects like fever, aches, and sore arms may occur, serious reactions are extremely rare. Vaccination does not provide immediate protection, and it takes several weeks for the body to develop maximum immunity. The duration of protection from COVID-19 vaccines is estimated to be at least 6 months for most people. To manage mild side effects, rest, fluid intake, and pain-relieving medications are recommended. Vaccination significantly reduces the likelihood of experiencing symptoms or severe illness if infected with COVID-19. Approved COVID-19 vaccines, including the original and bivalent versions, remain effective in preventing severe disease. For high-risk individuals, delaying vaccination is not advised, and any available vaccine provides better protection than none. Monovalent XBB vaccines are in development, and eligible individuals may consider these when available. It is still possible to contract and spread COVID-19 after vaccination, so adhering to health authority guidelines, hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette are important to maintain overall health and well-being.

Title: COVID-19 hospitalizations higher than last December, MOH warns
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Ottawa's medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned that COVID-19 levels in the community, as measured by wastewater surveillance, are currently higher than they were at the same time last year. Additionally, the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 is also higher compared to the same period in 2022. This data indicates that COVID-19 remains a significant concern in the community, especially for older adults who are at a higher risk of hospitalization and death. To protect themselves, Dr. Etches encourages residents, particularly those over 60, to get vaccinated against both COVID-19 and the flu before holiday gatherings. However, Ottawa Public Health is planning to reduce its COVID-19 response, including cutting temporary workers hired during the pandemic peak, due to financial constraints and decreasing demand for vaccines.

Here is a summary of the article: While we have made significant progress in understanding and managing COVID-19 since 2020, it is important to stay updated with the latest information and guidelines. Vaccination remains the best defense against the virus, offering strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even for those vaccinated, it is advisable to follow public health guidelines, such as wearing masks indoors and avoiding crowded places when COVID-19 transmission rates are high. COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads through aerosols and droplets. Most infections result in mild symptoms similar to a cold or flu, but it can be severe for older adults, individuals with underlying health conditions, and those who are unvaccinated. Long COVID, a post-viral syndrome with various symptoms, can also affect some individuals. The article emphasizes the importance of vaccination, explaining that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective in preventing serious illness and reducing the risk of long COVID. It also introduces mRNA vaccines, which use mRNA to instruct cells to produce the spike protein, triggering an immune response without using the actual virus. Additionally, the article provides a comprehensive glossary of relevant terms, including "community spread," "diagnostic test," "herd immunity," "mutation," "variants of concern," and more, helping readers understand the key concepts related to COVID-19.
