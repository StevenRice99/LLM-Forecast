Title: Covid-19: Primary vaccination for general population no longer recommended by the French health authority
Publisher: Le Monde
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The French National Authority for Health (HAS) has recommended offering an extra dose of the COVID-9 vaccine in the fall to those most at risk, including people aged 65 and over, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and individuals living with or in regular contact with vulnerable people. This is in line with the previous campaign and the ongoing shift towards annual COVID-19 booster doses. The HAS has also extended the list of eligible individuals to include young children from 6 months of age with co-morbidities. For those aged 80 and above, HAS suggests a booster as early as spring, especially if their last injection or infection was over six months ago. This recommendation is supported by studies showing that the protection offered by a booster dose decreases over time, particularly in the elderly. However, the HAS does not recommend a general population booster at this time, citing the limited health consequences of the currently circulating Omicron sub-variants and the long-lasting nature of cellular immunity. This decision marks a strategic shift, focusing on vulnerable populations rather than the general public, given the low-level circulation of less virulent virus strains.

Title: Impact of COVID-19 on air quality in Québec
Publisher: Gouvernement du Québec
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the positive impact of COVID-19 confinement measures on air quality in Québec, Canada. Due to a decrease in road transportation during the lockdown, air concentrations of pollutants associated with vehicle emissions also decreased. This improvement in air quality was observed at a monitoring station along the Henri-IV highway in Québec City, where traffic flow was reduced by up to 60% during the peak of the lockdown measures. This data provides valuable insight into the relationship between transportation and air pollution. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, several factors, including air quality, can be considered. Here are some key points to consider: The positive impact of confinement measures on air quality: The improvement in air quality due to reduced road transportation suggests that similar measures or travel restrictions could be implemented in the future to mitigate pollution levels, particularly in highly populated or polluted areas. This could have a positive impact on respiratory health overall, affecting the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The relationship between air pollution and respiratory illnesses: Poor air quality is known to exacerbate respiratory conditions, including COVID-19. By reducing air pollution, there may be a corresponding decrease in the severity of COVID-19 cases, which could lead to lower hospitalization rates. This relationship between air quality and respiratory health is an important consideration for forecasting hospitalizations. The impact of seasonal changes: Seasonal variations in air quality and respiratory health are also important factors to consider. For example, during the winter months, when respiratory illnesses tend to increase, air pollution levels can also worsen due to factors such as increased heating and reduced air circulation. This could potentially impact the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. The role of public health measures: The effectiveness of public health measures, such as social distancing, mask mandates, and vaccination campaigns, cannot be overstated in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. These measures can significantly reduce the spread of the virus and lower hospitalization rates. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the implementation and adherence to these public health guidelines when making predictions. In summary, while the article focuses on the positive impact of COVID-19 confinement measures on air quality, it also highlights the potential implications for respiratory health and COVID-19 hospitalizations. By considering the relationship between air pollution, respiratory illnesses, and the effectiveness of public health measures, forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations can be more accurately determined.

Title: ‘It’s perfect’: World’s first generative AI-designed COVID drug to start clinical trials
Publisher: Toronto Star
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article provides a table with COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts for all 50 states in the US, as well as some territories and military bases. The table includes the state or region, and the forecasted number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations for the given location. These forecasts are likely based on various factors such as current infection rates, hospitalization rates, and the availability of medical resources. The article also emphasizes the importance of considering the limitations of such forecasts, as they are subject to change due to various factors, including the emergence of new variants, changes in behavior, and the implementation of public health measures. It is crucial to utilize these forecasts as a tool for preparation and resource allocation rather than as definitive predictions. Here are some additional key points to consider when interpreting the forecasts: The forecasts are typically provided with a range of values or confidence intervals, indicating the level of uncertainty associated with the predictions. The forecasts are based on assumptions and models that may not fully capture the complex dynamics of the pandemic. Local factors, such as vaccination rates, adherence to public health measures, and the presence of new variants, can significantly impact hospitalization rates in specific regions. The forecasts should be used to inform healthcare resource allocation, staffing decisions, and the development or adjustment of public health strategies. Continuous monitoring of hospitalization data and updates to forecasts is essential to respond to changing trends and conditions. It is important for public health officials and policymakers to utilize these forecasts alongside other data sources and expert opinions to make informed decisions that protect the health and safety of their communities.

Title: COMMENTARY: Wear a respirator, not a cloth or surgical mask, to protect against respiratory viruses
Publisher: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the effectiveness of masks and respirators in preventing the person-to-person transmission of infectious respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. The authors argue that two recent publications, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a Cochrane review, which conclude that there is no difference between surgical masks and respirators in preventing such transmission, are deeply flawed. The authors explain that the premise of these studies, that respiratory viruses are transmitted only through large droplets, is incorrect. Instead, the science shows that the predominant mode of transmission is through the inhalation of small particles, typically around 1 micrometer in size. This means that COVID-19 and flu are spread primarily through aerosol inhalation, rather than droplet transmission, which occurs when someone coughs or sneezes directly into the face of another person. The article then discusses the limitations of masks, including cloth and surgical masks, in protecting against aerosol inhalation. Surgical masks, for example, may prevent large droplets from contacting the nose and mouth but offer little protection against smaller inhalable particles. Respirators, on the other hand, are designed to prevent aerosol inhalation and have very effective filters that fit most faces. The authors critique the RCT by Loeb et al., which compared SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers wearing respirators or masks, as unethical and flawed in its design and execution. They also argue that the Cochrane review by Jefferson et al. is biased and fails to consider the latest understanding of infectious particle inhalation. Overall, the authors emphasize the importance of wearing respirators, rather than masks, to protect against aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses. They highlight the need for continuous, proper use of respirators in healthcare settings and suggest that even members of the public can benefit from wearing respirators, even without fit-testing.

Title: Retail e-commerce and COVID-19: How online sales evolved as in-person shopping resumed
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail e-commerce and in-person shopping in Canada. Here is a summary, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: During the COVID-19 lockdown periods, Canadian retailers were subject to public health restrictions, which gradually lifted in 2022, allowing consumers to resume unrestricted in-person shopping. Despite the reopening, e-commerce remains important, with retail e-commerce sales increasing by 67.9% from February 2020 to July 2022. The share of e-commerce sales as a proportion of total retail sales also increased significantly from 2019 to 2022 (July year-to-date). The persistence of higher retail e-commerce sales compared to pre-pandemic levels suggests a long-term change in consumer spending habits and retailer operating models. At the onset of the pandemic, retail e-commerce sales surged while in-store sales declined for most retail subsectors. In 2022, e-commerce sales remained elevated in some subsectors, while others saw a transition back to in-store shopping. Retail subsectors deemed non-essential, such as clothing and electronics, experienced increased e-commerce sales during store closures. As restrictions eased, e-commerce sales declined, indicating a potential structural change in consumer preferences and retailer business models. Building material and garden equipment suppliers, deemed essential during the pandemic, saw increased e-commerce sales due to strong demand and price pressures. Health and personal care stores had slower e-commerce growth, with consumers continuing to purchase essential items in-store. The changes in business offerings and consumer behavior during the pandemic may have long-term impacts on the retail trade sector. While the article does not directly provide forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations, the information on retail e-commerce and shopping behavior can be useful for understanding the economic impact of the pandemic and consumer trends. These trends could indirectly influence various aspects of the pandemic response, including hospitalization rates, as they relate to overall economic health and recovery.

Title: Hickory, dickory, dock, payment verification deadlines are running out the clock: COVID-19 benefits in Canada
Publisher: Borden Ladner Gervais LLP (BLG)
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may soon start contacting individuals and organizations regarding their eligibility for COVID-19 benefits and potential overpayments. The auditor general's report found that $4.6 billion in COVID-19 benefits were incorrectly paid to ineligible individuals and organizations due to insufficient preand post-payment verification. The CRA and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) have a deadline of 36 months from the date of payment to complete post-payment verification and determine eligibility. This deadline is extended to 72 months in cases of suspected fraud or misrepresentation. The report emphasizes that the CRA is running out of time to verify eligibility, especially in cases where fraud is suspected. There is a disagreement between the auditor general and the CRA regarding the calculation of overpayments, with the CRA claiming that the amounts in the report are exaggerated. The COVID-19 benefits programs had minimal eligibility verification processes to ensure timely support for Canadians, which may have contributed to overpayments. The CRA and ESDC are recommended to update their post-payment verification plans and increase the extent of verifications to address potential overpayments. The CRA has various avenues to collect overpayments from businesses and individuals, such as requirements to pay, liens, and seizure of assets. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered: Infection rates: Monitoring the number of new COVID-19 cases and the positivity rate can provide an indication of the disease's spread and the potential for hospitalizations. Variant severity: Different variants of COVID-19 can result in varying levels of severity and hospitalization rates. The impact of new variants should be closely watched. Vaccination rates: The percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated, as well as the booster uptake, can significantly influence hospitalization rates. Higher vaccination rates generally lead to lower hospitalization rates. Healthcare system capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units, and healthcare staff can impact the ability to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients. Public health measures: The implementation or relaxation of public health measures, such as mask mandates and social distancing, can affect transmission rates and hospitalizations. Wastewater surveillance: Monitoring viral loads in wastewater can provide an early warning system for potential surges in infections and hospitalizations. Epidemiological modeling: Mathematical models that consider various factors, such as infection rates, vaccination coverage, and demographic data, can forecast hospitalization trends. By considering these factors and utilizing data-driven approaches, public health officials and healthcare systems can forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and allocate resources accordingly. However, it is important to recognize that the situation can change rapidly, and forecasts may need to be adjusted based on new developments.

Title: Government communication on COVID-19 contributed to 'Freedom Convoy' origin: report
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The report by Justice Paul Rouleau on the federal Liberal government's invocation of the Emergencies Act in response to the truck convoy protests in Ottawa last winter offers insights into the factors that contributed to the fervor of the demonstrations. The report identifies public health measures, particularly the vaccine mandate for truckers, as a significant factor in the protests. The Canada Border Services Agency's mishandling of the mandate's announcement, including an error about quarantine requirements for unvaccinated Canadian truckers, exacerbated negative sentiments. The symbol of the commercial truck driver resonated with Canadians who felt their lives were being disrupted by COVID-19 restrictions. The spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media played a major role in the protests, with key convoy leaders expressing conspiratorial views. Justice Rouleau acknowledged the hardship caused by COVID-19 restrictions and acknowledged confusion over certain rules, such as playground closures and disparities between big box stores and small businesses. The report makes 56 recommendations, including a call for governments to address the societal impact of social media and the spread of false information.

Title: Can You Develop Eye Issues After the COVID-19 Vaccine?
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the rare occurrence of optic neuritis as a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause eye pain and reduced vision. While this side effect has been reported, it is important to note that it is very rare. Out of the millions of people who have received COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, only a small number of cases of optic neuritis have been diagnosed. Here are the key facts to consider: Optic neuritis as a side effect: Optic neuritis has been reported as a rare side effect associated with COVID-19 vaccination, with only 26 people out of millions of vaccine recipients experiencing this issue. Multiple vaccines mentioned: The cases mentioned in the review involved various COVID-19 vaccines, including those used in the United States (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and others not approved for use in the US (AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, and CoviShield). Timing of symptoms: On average, individuals developed eye symptoms approximately 9.6 days after receiving the vaccination. Treatment and recovery: Most individuals with follow-up information showed improvement in their vision over time with corticosteroid treatment. While optic neuritis is a potential side effect, it is important to remember that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing serious illness and hospitalization far outweigh the risks of rare side effects. This information can be useful in understanding the rare eye-related side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine but does not directly help forecast hospitalizations.

Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses a study that aimed to evaluate the rates of miscarriage and live birth among pregnant women who received a COVID-19 vaccine. The study reviewed existing literature and considered data from various types of studies, including randomized control trials and observational studies. Overall, the pregnancy outcomes of 149,685 women who received one of six different COVID-19 vaccines were analyzed. The average miscarriage rate among vaccinated pregnant women was found to be 9%, which is consistent with the miscarriage rate in the general population before the pandemic. There was no significant difference in miscarriage rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, indicating that the COVID-19 vaccine does not appear to increase the risk of miscarriage. However, the study had some limitations, including heterogeneity in study design and patient characteristics, as well as a risk of bias. The majority of the studies included in the analysis were also short-term assessments of vaccine safety, which does not provide insight into long-term pregnancy outcomes. The authors recommend further research with standardized reporting systems to reduce research waste and improve the certainty of conclusions. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vaccination status of the population. The study suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for pregnant women and does not increase their risk of miscarriage. This information can be used to encourage vaccination among pregnant women, which may help reduce hospitalizations by preventing severe cases of COVID-19 in this vulnerable group.
