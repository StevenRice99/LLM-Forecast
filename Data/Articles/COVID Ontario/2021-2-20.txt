Title: Why are people developing diabetes after having COVID-19?
Publisher: Wexner Medical Center - The Ohio State University
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the potential link between COVID-19 and the development of diabetes, highlighting the findings of a global analysis that suggested up to 14.4% of people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 also developed diabetes. The author, Dr. Kathleen Wyne, an endocrinologist and professor, explains that while the exact mechanism is not yet understood, it is likely that COVID-19 acts as a stressor that reveals underlying insulin resistance or prediabetes. Here are the key points from the article: Lasting Effects of COVID-19: Some COVID-19 survivors may develop long-term health issues like diabetes, a chronic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels. Global Analysis: A study published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism found that up to 14.4% of people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 also developed diabetes. Viral Infection vs. Unidentified Diabetes: The author questions whether COVID-19 directly affects insulin-producing cells or if the illness accelerates the onset of previously undiagnosed diabetes. Data and Viral Impact: Dr. Wyne has not seen data suggesting that COVID-19 directly affects insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Most people with prediabetes (88 million) and undiagnosed diabetes (25% of 34 million) are unaware of their condition. Diabetes Causes: Type 2 diabetes risk factors include a complex interplay between insulin production and resistance, with diet, weight, and physical activity being key modulators. Acute stressors like pregnancy, steroid use, or cytokine inflammation in COVID-19 patients can trigger hyperglycemia. Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Development: Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed after an acute illness, with the immune system attacking insulin-producing cells. In the case of Type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 may act as an acute stressor, revealing underlying insulin resistance or prediabetes. Warning Signs of Diabetes Post-COVID-19: These include frequent urination, increased thirst, blurry vision, weight loss, slow wound healing, and fatigue. Preventing Diabetes Post-COVID-19: Focus on losing 15 pounds, establishing an exercise routine, improving diet, and getting tested for diabetes post-discharge and regularly thereafter. Importance of Diabetes Management: Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can damage blood vessels, nerves, organs, and lead to complications like fatty liver disease and heart failure. Early intensive glucose control can delay or prevent these complications. Dr. Wyne emphasizes that COVID-19-related hyperglycemia should serve as a warning sign for future Type 2 diabetes development, providing an opportunity for individuals to make lifestyle adjustments to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes.

Title: Why Canada is falling behind in Covid vaccinations
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False

Canada has secured the most COVID-19 vaccine doses per capita but is facing challenges in obtaining and administering the vaccines. The country started its inoculation drive in December and has administered just over 1.39 million doses so far, ranking 20th in global rankings of doses per 100 people. Critics have blamed the slow rollout on the government's failure to secure priority delivery and lack of domestic production capacity. Canada signed deals with seven vaccine suppliers but focused on vaccines from European factories due to fears of export bans under the Trump administration. This backfired as European factories struggled with supply, and Canada faced delivery delays from Moderna and Pfizer. As of early February, only 2.43% of the population had received at least one dose, and the government aims to vaccinate all Canadians by the end of September. The slow pace has caused frustration, with polls indicating a decline in government approval. To address the issue, Canada is receiving some Pfizer doses ahead of schedule and has purchased additional Moderna doses, while also investing in domestic production capacity for the Novavax vaccine, which is still in trials.

Title: The future of work after COVID-19
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted labor markets worldwide in 2020, with millions of people losing their jobs or adjusting to working from home. The pandemic has also accelerated several trends that may reshape work in the post-pandemic era. These include a shift towards remote work and virtual meetings, a boom in e-commerce and other virtual transactions, and increased adoption of automation and AI, particularly in high-proximity work arenas such as medical and personal care, on-site customer service, and leisure and travel. According to the report, about 20-25% of the workforce in advanced economies could work from home between three and five days a week, potentially leading to a shift in the geography of work away from large cities. The increase in remote work and virtual meetings may also impact business travel, with a significant portion of it not returning post-pandemic. The pandemic has also accelerated the growth of e-commerce and other virtual transactions, with many consumers discovering the convenience of online shopping and services. This shift has led to growth in delivery, transportation, and warehouse jobs. In terms of automation and AI, the report finds that work arenas with high levels of human interaction and physical proximity are likely to see the greatest acceleration in the adoption of these technologies. This may result in a shift in the mix of occupations, with little job growth in low-wage occupations and increased demand for workers in healthcare and STEM fields. Overall, the report estimates that across the eight countries studied, more than 100 million workers (1 in 16) will need to transition to different occupations by 2030 due to the impact of COVID-19 on labor trends. This represents a 12% increase in the number of workers needing to transition compared to pre-pandemic estimates. The report also highlights that the most disadvantaged workers, including those with less education, ethnic minorities, and women, may face the biggest job transitions. To facilitate workforce transitions, the report calls for businesses and policymakers to provide additional training and education programs for workers, enhance digital infrastructure, and support workers migrating between occupations.

Title: Prices for private COVID-19 tests can range from $160 to $1,200, with little oversight of the industry
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the growing private COVID-19 testing industry in Canada and the lack of regulation surrounding it. While private PCR tests are now crucial for travel, visiting long-term care facilities, and maintaining workplace operations, there are concerns about the lack of oversight and the potential impact on COVID-19 data. Here are the key points: A growing number of private companies offer PCR tests for COVID-19 in Canada, catering to travellers, workers, and those visiting long-term care facilities. There is a lack of regulation and oversight in the private testing industry, with no single external system for dealing with complaints. The cost of private tests varies widely across the country, with prices ranging from $160 to $1,198. Most provinces do not track the number of private tests conducted or the positivity rate of these tests, which could impact the overall understanding of COVID-19 prevalence. Experts emphasize the importance of private testing in alleviating strain on the public health system, but call for ethical oversight to ensure accuracy and consistency. Regarding the use of private testing data for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific information on this aspect. However, the data collected by private testing companies could potentially be utilized for such forecasts. If the private testing data is comprehensive and accurately reported, it could provide valuable insights into the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the population. This, in turn, could help inform projections and forecasts for hospitalizations. However, as the article highlights, the lack of centralized tracking and inconsistent reporting of private testing data may pose challenges in utilizing this information for forecasting purposes.

Title: Interferon speeds recovery in some COVID-19 patients, U of T and UHN study finds
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a clinical study led by Jordan Feld, a researcher at the University of Toronto, which found that an experimental antiviral drug, peginterferon-lambda, can significantly speed up recovery for some COVID-19 patients. The treatment has the potential to become an important intervention for infected patients who do not require hospitalization and could help curb community spread while vaccines are being rolled out. The study, published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine, found that patients who received a single injection of peginterferon-lambda were over four times more likely to have cleared the infection within seven days compared to those who received a placebo. The treatment was especially effective in patients with high viral levels, who are associated with more severe disease and a higher risk of transmission to others. Interferon-lambda is a protein produced by the body in response to viral infections, and it can activate multiple cellular pathways to kill invading viruses. The coronavirus behind COVID-19 prevents the body from producing interferons, but treatment with interferon-lambda can activate those virus-killing pathways. Additionally, interferon-lambda has the advantage of acting on specific receptors in the body, leading to fewer side effects than other interferons. The clinical trial was conducted in Toronto with 60 participants and showed promising results. Additional studies are ongoing at the University of Toronto, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University to further evaluate the effectiveness of peginterferon-lambda in hospitalized patients and in preventing infection in those exposed to the virus. The development of effective treatments like peginterferon-lambda can play a crucial role in reducing the burden on healthcare systems by shortening the duration of infection and decreasing the risk of transmission, which in turn can help forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations more effectively.

Title: Sharing household tasks: Teaming up during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This article examines how couples in Canada shared household tasks during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and how the presence of children and the increase in telework may have impacted the distribution of these tasks. The analysis is based on data from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series conducted by Statistics Canada. Key findings include: Nearly 7 in 10 Canadians (68%) reported being satisfied with the distribution of household tasks during the pandemic, with higher satisfaction among those aged 55 and older (74%) compared to those younger than 55 (63%). Women were more likely than men to be dissatisfied (16% vs 9%). Women remained primarily responsible for tasks like laundry (56%) and meal preparation (48%), while men were more likely to handle household finances (40%). Doing dishes and housework were the most equally shared tasks. Compared to 2017, men contributed more to household tasks during the pandemic, with increases in grocery shopping (from 15% to 30%), laundry (from 8% to 16%), and household finances (from 34% to 40%). The presence of young children in the household impacted the distribution of tasks, with a higher proportion of men doing grocery shopping (42%) and a lower proportion doing housework (7%) when there was at least one child under 6. Telework did not significantly affect the distribution of tasks, except for a slight increase in men preparing meals when both partners worked remotely. Overall, despite the challenges of balancing work and family during the pandemic, the distribution of household tasks among couples remained similar to pre-pandemic patterns, with women still bearing a larger burden. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, other factors such as vaccination rates, severity of cases, and healthcare system capacity would need to be considered in addition to the dynamics of household task distribution.
