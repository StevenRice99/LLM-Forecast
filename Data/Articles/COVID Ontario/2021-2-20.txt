Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False

TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it provides information on the vaccination strategy in Kingston, which can impact hospitalization rates. The key points relevant for forecasting are: The vaccination strategy is expected to ramp up in phase three, with larger venues and mass immunization clinics, which can lead to increased vaccination rates and potentially reduced hospitalizations. The plan aims to administer up to 3,000 immunizations per day, which can help reduce the number of susceptible individuals and subsequent hospitalizations. The vaccination clinics will also be set up in rural communities, which can help reduce hospitalizations in these areas. However, it is essential to note that the article does not provide direct data on hospitalization rates or forecasts but rather provides context on the vaccination strategy, which can indirectly impact hospitalization rates.

Title: 'Our job to step in': Hospitals take on COVID-19 patients from other overwhelmed regions

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article discusses the IMS Transfer system, which helps manage patient numbers across hospitals in Ontario and transfers patients from overwhelmed hospitals to those with available space. Between November 16 and February 9, 545 non-ICU COVID-19 patients and 320 non-COVID-19 patients were transferred to build capacity for COVID-19 patients. 70 patients were transferred from one intensive care unit to another since the new year. Halton Healthcare, which operates Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital, has taken in 190 COVID-19 patients from other regions, with 80% of patients in the COVID-19 unit coming from outside the region. The hospital has created an indoor "field hospital" with 40 beds to provide full medical care for non-COVID-19 patients, freeing up space for COVID-19 patients. The article mentions that 25% of COVID-19 patients can quickly worsen, requiring hospitals to keep a certain number of ICU beds unoccupied as a contingency measure. The head of Ontario Health, Matthew Anderson, conveyed a message to hospital CEOs to reserve one-third of their ICU beds for transfers from overwhelmed hospitals in other regions. These values can be used to inform forecasting models, such as: The number of patients transferred between hospitals and regions The capacity of hospitals to take in additional patients The proportion of patients who require ICU care The impact of the IMS Transfer system on hospital capacity and patient outcomes By incorporating these values into forecasting models, it may be possible to better predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, and inform decision-making for hospital capacity planning and resource allocation.
