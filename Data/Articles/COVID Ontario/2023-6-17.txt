Here is a summary of the article, focusing on the information relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the results of the COVID-OUT trial, which investigated the potential use of pre-existing medications to treat COVID-19 and reduce long-term symptoms. While the trial found that metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin were ineffective in treating new COVID-19 infections and reducing hospitalizations, metformin showed a promising effect in reducing the incidence of long COVID symptoms. This finding has significant implications for reducing the global public health burden of COVID-19. Key points to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The trial results suggest that metformin may play a role in reducing long-term complications of COVID-19, which could indirectly impact hospitalization rates over time. The study focused on higher-risk groups, including individuals over 30 with overweight or obesity as risk factors. The applicability of these results to individuals without these risk factors is unclear. The trial had a specific treatment protocol, requiring medication to be started within seven days of infection, preferably within the first four days. This prompt initiation of treatment may pose a challenge in practice. While metformin showed potential in preventing long COVID, its effectiveness in treating individuals already experiencing long-term symptoms is unknown. The article emphasizes the need for replication of these results by other research groups and acknowledges the challenges in changing clinical practice based on a single study. Metformin's general safety profile, low cost, and potential benefits may lead to updates in guidelines recommending its use for COVID-19, despite the practical challenges. In conclusion, while the COVID-OUT trial provides promising insights into the potential use of metformin for reducing long COVID symptoms, further research and careful consideration are needed before implementing widespread changes in clinical practice. The impact of these findings on COVID-19 hospitalizations may be indirect and depend on various factors, including patient risk profiles and timely access to treatment.

The article discusses the experiences of two women, Katie Kitchen and Marylynn McLeod, who have been living with long COVID, and the impact the condition has had on their lives. Long COVID, also known as post-COVID-19 condition, is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that persist for months after the initial COVID-19 infection. These symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive issues such as memory loss. According to the Office of the Chief Science Advisor of Canada, as of August 2022, approximately 15% of adults in Canada who had contracted COVID-19 (approximately 1.4 million people) reported experiencing symptoms of long COVID three months or more after their initial infection. Kitchen, a 35-year-old who tested positive for COVID-19 in December 2020, describes her experience with long COVID as unpredictable and debilitating. She experiences "crashes" where her body feels weighed down and fatigued, and she has to rest for days. Kitchen has undergone various tests and treatments, including participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program and seeking help from specialists. She advocates for a comprehensive treatment center dedicated to long COVID in Manitoba to streamline care and reduce patient exhaustion. McLeod, a 56-year-old former insurance broker, contracted COVID-19 in 2020 and has been on long-term disability due to long COVID. She struggles with fatigue, memory issues, and speech problems, and finds the isolation and lack of understanding from others challenging. Dr. Alan Katz, a family physician and professor at the University of Manitoba, is researching long COVID in the province. His team is analyzing data from the medical records of 66,000 people in Manitoba who tested positive for COVID-19 before December 2021 to understand the prevalence and risk factors associated with long COVID. The research aims to provide valuable insights into the seriousness of the condition and identify potential outcomes. Manitoba Shared Health has stated that there are no plans for a dedicated long COVID clinic in the province, and they recommend individuals with symptoms consult their healthcare providers for care options. They also provide resources, tips, and tools for people living with long COVID on their website. The article highlights the ongoing impact of long COVID on individuals' lives and the need for continued research and dedicated treatment options. While some improvements in symptoms have been noted, the unpredictable nature and variety of symptoms associated with long COVID present challenges for those affected and the healthcare system.

Title: U of T researchers find vulnerability in COVID-19 variants that reduces transmissibility
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Researchers at the University of Toronto have discovered a potential weakness in the Omicron variant of COVID-19 that could help prevent its spread and lead to new treatment methods. They found that mutations in the spike protein of the Omicron variant can hinder its ability to bind to and enter host cells, a process necessary for the virus to infect people. Specifically, Omicron-specific mutations in the spike protein reduce its binding ability to the ACE2 receptor in host cells. This discovery highlights a potential target for therapeutic interventions. The team also found that the Omicron variant is particularly sensitive to chemical reduction, a process that can prevent the virus from spreading. Through aerosol therapy, reducing agents can be delivered directly to the lungs to take advantage of this vulnerability without causing harm to non-target proteins or the body at large. Additionally, the researchers identified an antioxidant called bucillamine, currently in clinical trials, to which Omicron variants are especially sensitive. Understanding the transmission mechanism of Omicron variants is crucial for developing effective treatments and preparedness. While the variant generally causes milder symptoms, it has an increased transmissibility rate and can still pose a threat to vulnerable populations. The research highlights the potential for targeting disulfide cleavage in Omicron infections and provides valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by helping identify those at higher risk and developing targeted treatments.
