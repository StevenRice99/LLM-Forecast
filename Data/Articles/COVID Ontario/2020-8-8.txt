Title: Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of COVID-19 on CO2 emissions and how it can be used to forecast hospitalizations. The key points are: Google mobility data and Apple mobility data were used to estimate CO2 emission changes for 114 countries and US states, indicating a decrease in emissions due to reduced transit, residential, workplace, and retail activity. Le Quéré et al.'s sector analysis estimated emission changes in 8 sectors for 69 countries, representing 97% of global emissions, and their high estimates agreed well with Google transit trends. The study combined Google mobility data with Le Quéré et al.'s analysis to estimate global emission changes for CO2 and other pollutants due to COVID-19 restrictions, covering 99% of global emissions. Non-CO2 emission estimates were made using the EDGAR database, which provided gridded and national-level data on methane, nitrous oxide, and short-lived species for 2015. Emission scenarios were developed based on the assumption that climate action continues at the level of ambition implied by current NDCs until 2030. The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on NO2 concentrations was compared to observations from the OpenAQ database, showing a reduction in NO2 levels in many countries. The surface temperature change estimates were calculated using the FaIR model, and the results indicated that the COVID-19 related emission changes would have a negligible impact on global temperatures by 2030. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on CO2 emissions and other pollutants, and the methods used can be applied to forecast hospitalizations by assuming that hospitalization rates are correlated with infection rates, which are in turn influenced by human mobility patterns.

Title: What will our cities look like after COVID-19?
Publisher: UBC News
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on cities and urban life, and experts are analyzing the implications of these changes for city planning and space design. Some of the most striking immediate impacts of the pandemic on global cities include a decrease in pedestrian traffic, particularly in areas associated with commercial activity, and a transformation of city building, design, energy flows, mobility patterns, and transportation systems. These changes may be temporary or permanent, with some cities accelerating existing plans and others experimenting with new approaches. Over the longer term, cities may implement low-cost and temporary street calming and pedestrianization projects, re-design streets to accommodate increased demand for curbside parking due to online shopping and food delivery, and change the look and feel of tourist-reliant areas. The pandemic may also have a lasting impact on our sense of place and space, potentially making it more difficult for spontaneous social interactions and limiting the development of new relationships. However, it also presents an opportunity to examine the links between urban planning, public space, and wellbeing, and to make informed decisions about building healthier cities. Additionally, the standard social distancing protocols have influenced the transformation of cities, with creative and innovative adaptations being made to systems, behaviors, and built spaces.

Here is a summary of the article, along with important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article provides an interactive tracker that compares COVID-19 cases in Canadian provinces and territories to American states, which is useful for understanding the impact of the pandemic in different regions. As of August 12, 2022, the tracker is archived but still accessible, and a new version is available that includes US state data. During the first two waves of the pandemic, Canada's highest-reporting regions had lower cases compared to American states. However, in the third wave, Canada's seven-day average reached its peak for the entire pandemic. The data is presented as a sorted list, ranking the provinces, states, territories, and Washington, D.C. by recent cases per capita. It also includes the all-time peak cases for Canada's provinces and territories. This information can help forecast hospitalizations by identifying regions with high case numbers, which may lead to increased hospitalizations. The data also provides context for understanding the severity of the pandemic in different areas and can inform public health decisions. The interactive tracker allows users to compare the 7-day average daily new total cases per million in different regions, with the option to sort by current cases or peak cases. As of mid-April, Canada had a higher seven-day average of daily cases than at any other point during the pandemic. The data sources are reputable and include the COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins University for US data and daily provincial reports for Canadian data. This article provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 cases in Canada and the US, offering valuable insights into the pandemic's impact on hospitalizations and public health responses.

Title: Redesigning Canada for Physical Distancing and COVID-19
Publisher: Queen's University
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
As Canada gradually reopens during the COVID-19 pandemic, urban planners and policymakers are modifying cities to accommodate physical distancing and curb the virus's spread. The article highlights Queen's Geography and Planning Professor John Meligrana's study to identify successful policies and protocols implemented by various cities. The research will be compiled into a report shared with urban planners and municipal leaders across Canada to aid in safe reopening. Key points from the article include: Public health officials emphasize physical distancing as a crucial measure against COVID-19, and urban planners play a vital role in designing spaces that facilitate this. Professor Meligrana's report aims to provide guidance on achieving physical distancing in densely populated Canadian cities, potentially saving lives during the pandemic. The project is funded by Rapid Response, a Queen's initiative supporting COVID-19 countermeasure research. The research team will examine issues related to public places, transportation, and vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic. One emerging trend is the concept of "quiet streets," where cities close roads to create more space for pedestrians due to reduced traffic. However, this approach faced backlash in Kingston, underscoring the importance of understanding the lessons learned from such initiatives. This article underscores the ongoing efforts to adapt urban environments to the challenges posed by COVID-19, with a focus on physical distancing as a key strategy to mitigate the virus's spread. The research initiative aims to provide actionable insights to urban planners and policymakers, helping them make informed decisions to protect public health and safety during the pandemic.

Title: PAHO Director warns of disruptions in regular health services due to COVID-19
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health services in the Americas, with over 9.7 million cases and 365,000 deaths as of August 2020, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Health workers are being redirected to care for COVID-19 patients, and people are hesitant to seek routine care due to infection fears. There has been a halt in routine vaccination campaigns, diabetes and hypertension programs, and pregnancy-related visits, impacting maternal and child health. Countries need to adapt and ensure primary health services continue alongside the COVID-19 response, including telemedicine and community outreach. PAHO emphasizes that countries must balance reopening economies with protecting public health. An integrated approach that offers COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and other essential services is crucial. Investments in primary health care improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand hospital capacity.

Title: COVID-19: Dont make university students choose between education and legal rights
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Universities in Canada are considering requiring students to sign COVID-19 liability waivers before returning to campus. St. Francis Xavier University (StFXU) in Nova Scotia, for example, initially proposed a waiver that would prevent students from returning to campus or participating in any activities without signing away their right to legal recourse if they contracted COVID-19 due to the university's negligence. While StFXU reconsidered the wording following community concerns, they ultimately decided to proceed with the waiver. The authors argue that such waivers are wrongheaded and may not even be enforceable. Post-secondary education is a public good that benefits society as a whole, and universities have a duty to provide a safe learning environment. Shifting the financial risk of COVID-19 infections to students is inappropriate, especially when universities unilaterally choose to offer in-person education. Waivers also remove incentives for universities to ensure campus safety. Legally, these waivers may not stand up due to the inequality of bargaining power between universities and students, and the Supreme Court of Canada's recent emphasis on contract fairness. Universities should focus on ensuring student safety rather than seeking legal immunity.

Title: Black people and other people of colour make up 83% of reported COVID-19 cases in Toronto
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

The article highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racialized and lower-income communities in Toronto, Canada. Here are the key points and important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: People of color, specifically Black, Arab, Middle Eastern, and West Asian individuals, are overrepresented among COVID-19 cases in Toronto when compared to their share of the city's population. They account for 83% of reported cases while only representing half of the population. 71% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in Toronto are people of color. However, this data is based on a relatively small number of hospitalizations, as there have not been many hospitalizations since the city started collecting socio-demographic data. Lower-income households and larger households are also disproportionately affected by COVID-19. 51% of reported cases were from low-income households, while only 30% of Toronto's population is considered low income. People living in households with five or more people make up 27% of cases, while only representing 20% of the population. The pandemic has magnified existing issues in marginalized communities, including poverty, poor housing, discrimination, and precarious work, leading to worse health and social outcomes. The data was collected from individuals infected with COVID-19 who voluntarily provided socio-demographic information. The city started collecting this data on May 20 and the findings cover up to July 16. The limitations of the data include a lack of information on long-term care and retirement home residents, as well as Indigenous people. Approximately 27% of cases within the timeframe did not have socio-demographic data collected. Toronto's health agency is working to address the needs of disproportionately affected communities through targeted testing, enhanced communications, and increased access to social supports. In the long term, addressing systemic racism, affordable housing, and access to employment and education are necessary. This data highlights the importance of collecting and analyzing socio-demographic information to inform public health responses and address inequities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
