From the data provided, it is difficult to make precise forecasts about COVID-19 hospitalizations in Quebec. However, some key facts and trends can be identified: There has been a general downward trend in new cases and deaths since the peak in January 2022. The number of new cases and deaths has fluctuated, with some periods of increase followed by decreases. The highest number of new cases reported in a single day was 17,122 on January 1, 2022. The highest number of new deaths reported in a single day was 98 on January 20, 2022. In the most recent data from July 18, 2022, there were 1,287 new cases and eight additional deaths reported.

Here is a summary of the article: In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the University of Toronto (U of T) announced it would cancel all in-person undergraduate and research-stream graduate courses across its three campuses from March 16 to April 3, with the possibility of extending the period. The decision aligns with the recommendation of public health authorities to practice "social distancing" and slow down the transmission of the virus. During this time, the university plans to utilize online platforms to deliver teaching instruction. While the campuses will remain open, many facilities will be closed to the public, and residences will still be provided for students who cannot return home. Staff who can work remotely are encouraged to do so. The university has been actively monitoring the situation since early January and had previously taken several precautionary measures, including canceling study abroad programs and advising against non-essential travel. As of March 17, there were 180 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario, and the province had ordered the shutdown of public schools for two weeks after the March break, affecting millions of students. U of T's President, Meric Gertler, expressed gratitude to the university community for their measured response and acknowledged the adjustments required by these changes. He emphasized the university's confidence in successfully meeting the challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through collective efforts. To aid in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, some important facts to consider include: The number of confirmed cases in Ontario as of the article's update (180 cases) The shutdown of Ontario's public schools for two weeks, affecting 2 million students The potential impact of social distancing measures on transmission rates The university's encouragement for staff to work remotely and students to stay in residences, which could affect the rate of transmission within the community These factors, along with ongoing monitoring and adherence to public health recommendations, will influence the forecast for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the region.

Title: Calling COVID-19 the “Wuhan Virus” or “China Virus” is inaccurate and xenophobic
Publisher: Yale School of Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article emphasizes the importance of responsible language use when discussing COVID-19 to prevent discrimination and stigmatization, especially against Asian communities. Here's a summary along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The official name for the disease is COVID-19, deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatization associated with referring to the illness based on its location or ethnicity. It is recommended to talk about "people who have COVID-19," "people being treated/recovering," or "people who died after contracting COVID-19." Avoid terms like "cases" or "victims." Emphasize that people "acquire" or "contract" COVID-19 rather than "transmit" or "infect others," as this implies intentionality and blame. Speak accurately about the risks of COVID-19 based on scientific data and official health advice. Do not spread unconfirmed rumors or use hyperbolic language. Focus on the effectiveness of prevention and treatment measures, and emphasize that most people can overcome the disease. Working together to support vulnerable communities is crucial. Responsible language use helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protects those affected by it. Some additional facts to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Hospitalization rates can vary based on factors such as the availability of medical resources, the age and overall health of the population, and the prevalence of underlying medical conditions. The incubation period for COVID-19 can range from 2 to 14 days, with an average of around 5 days. This means that there is a delay between when a person is infected and when they may require hospitalization. The percentage of infected individuals who require hospitalization varies but is generally estimated to be around 20%. However, this can change based on the transmission rate and the effectiveness of public health measures. The duration of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients can vary significantly, from a few days to several weeks or even months in severe cases. Local healthcare infrastructure and capacity play a crucial role in hospitalization rates. Areas with limited resources may experience higher hospitalization rates and more severe outcomes. The availability and implementation of effective treatments can impact hospitalization forecasts. Improved treatments can reduce the severity of cases and shorten hospital stays. The development and rollout of vaccines can significantly influence hospitalization forecasts over time, as vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and the need for hospitalization. Forecasting models often consider various scenarios based on different assumptions about transmission rates, intervention effectiveness, and healthcare system capacity.
