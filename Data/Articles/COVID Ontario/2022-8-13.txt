Title: What We Know About Getting a Second Booster Shot of COVID-19 Vaccines
Publisher: The Scientist
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots, particularly in relation to the Omicron variant. Experts suggest that people who are immunocompromised or in high-risk groups should get vaccinated and double boosted to protect themselves as best they can.
However, researchers also emphasize that relying solely on vaccine boosters is not a sustainable solution for preventing infection in the general population. Instead, they recommend deploying vaccines against new variants, such as Omicron-specific boosters, which are likely to offer better protection than the original vaccines.
The article highlights several key points:
1. Vulnerable populations: Immunocompromised individuals and those in high-risk groups should get vaccinated and double boosted to protect themselves.
2. Omicron-specific boosters: Experts expect that Omicron-specific boosters will become available, offering better protection than the original vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 variants presently dominating the globe.
3. Booster fatigue: Researchers warn that relying on repeated booster shots may not be a long-term solution and can lead to "booster fatigue," where people become complacent about vaccination.
4. Public health measures: Experts recommend reintegrating or continuing other public safety measures, such as masking, isolating and distancing, providing financial support, and improving indoor ventilation, to complement vaccination efforts.
5. Changing behavior: Researchers suggest that changing our attitudes and everyday behavior, rather than relying solely on vaccines, would likely make a bigger difference in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Some key quotes from the article include:
"Clearly the vulnerable population, including those that are immunocompromised and those whose lifestyle makes them easier targets of COVID, should not wait till [Omicron boosters roll out this] fall, because the current vaccines will provide them some level of protection." (Nagarkatti)
"If you’re in a high-risk group ... anything you can do to get neutralizing antibody levels up is a good thing." (Bright)
"It’s not sustainable to plan a vaccination regime where you have to give one dose every two or three months to prevent infection." (Rappuoli)
Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including vaccination, public health measures, and changing behavior.
