The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the effectiveness of second booster shots in preventing severe illness and death among high-risk populations, including older adults and those with compromised immune systems. The article highlights the importance of booster shots in reducing hospitalizations and severe disease outcomes, which is crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Key values mentioned in the article that are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: 31% more protection against symptomatic illness and 40% more protection against severe illness beyond that provided by the first booster, as found in a study on long-term care facility residents in Ontario. 64% better protection against hospitalizations, 67% better protection against severe illness, and 72% better protection against death from COVID-19, as found in a study on twice-boosted volunteers residing in long-term care facilities in Israel. A four-fifths reduction in deaths among those who were boosted twice compared to those who were only boosted once, as found in a retrospective cohort study on the effectiveness of the second booster among 60-plus-year-olds in Israel. These values suggest that second booster shots can significantly reduce the risk of hospitalizations and severe disease outcomes among high-risk populations, which is essential for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Ontario hospitals plan to uphold COVID-19 vaccine policies amid 'crisis' staffing shortages
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it provides information on the current staffing situation in hospitals and the impact of mandatory vaccination policies on staff shortages. The key points relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations are: Staff shortages in Ontario hospitals have reached a "crisis" level, with emergency departments temporarily closing. Dozens of hospitals have kept their mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies in place, leading to the termination of staff who refused to get vaccinated. The number of unvaccinated staff is relatively small, with University Health Network reporting 153 out of 17,500 employees (1%) did not comply with their policy. Hospitals are prioritizing patient safety and maintaining their vaccination policies, despite staffing pressures. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario supports the hospitals' stance on vaccine policies, citing the need to prioritize patient safety. These points suggest that staffing shortages may continue to be a challenge for Ontario hospitals, potentially impacting their ability to respond to COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. However, the maintenance of vaccination policies may help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission within hospitals.
