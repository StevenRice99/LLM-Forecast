Title: Protection of COVID-19 vaccination and previous infection against Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article assesses the protection provided by previous infection, primary vaccination, and booster vaccination against the Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants of COVID-19. The key findings are as follows: 1. Reduced protection against Omicron BA.1 compared to Delta: The protection offered by vaccination and previous infection was significantly lower against the Omicron BA.1 variant compared to the Delta variant. 2. Comparable protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2: The level of protection against infection by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 was similar for both variants. 3. Increased effectiveness with booster vaccination: Booster vaccination provided higher effectiveness against Omicron, but the protection waned significantly within three months. 4. Modest vaccine effectiveness against Omicron: The vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection was relatively low, consistent with findings from other studies. 5. Waning effectiveness of primary vaccination: Similar to other studies, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against both Delta and Omicron infection was found to wane over time. 6. Loss of protection from previous infection: The protection against Omicron infection conferred by previous infection with a different variant was reduced, leading to an increase in reinfection cases during the Omicron wave. 7. Combination of vaccination and previous infection: The highest levels of protection were observed in recently boosted individuals with a previous infection. The sequence of vaccination and infection did not seem to impact the level of protection. 8. Differences between cohorts: There were some differences in protection estimates between the Delta-Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.1-BA.2 cohorts, which could be attributed to changes in testing advice, different distributions of previous infection variants, and higher SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the latter cohort. 9. Similar trends across age groups: Overall, similar trends were observed across age groups, with higher protection against Delta infection and comparable protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infections. 10. Limitations: The study has limitations, including potential differences in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals, misclassification of vaccination status, and underestimation of the effect of previous infection due to missing data. 11. Vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19: The study focused on community testing data, primarily covering mild infections. Vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19, including hospitalization, is typically higher than against infection. 12. Conclusion: Primary vaccination and pre-Omicron infections offer limited protection against Omicron infection. Booster vaccination provides increased but waning protection, highlighting the importance of timely booster doses for high-risk individuals. The high number of Omicron infections could contribute to broader population immunity.

Title: Lingering health problems in kids after COVID-19 and MIS-C
Publisher: Boston Children's Discoveries
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
A study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals that more than one in four children hospitalized with COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) experience long-term health issues. The research, led by Boston Children's Hospital, tracked 358 patients under 21 who were admitted to 25 US children's hospitals between May 2020 and May 2021, before vaccines were available for this age group. The study found that 27% of those with acute COVID-19 and 30% of those with MIS-C experienced persistent symptoms, activity impairment, or both, two to four months later. The most common lingering symptoms included fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and cough. Dr. Adrienne Randolph, the study leader, emphasizes the benefits of vaccination, stating that the risks of severe illness and lingering complications are higher than the rare risks of vaccine complications. The study also highlights the need for ongoing investigations into the neurological complications of COVID-19 and MIS-C, as well as the impact of different variants on children's health.

Title: Canadian aviation amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Part 3. International comparison
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted aviation, with airlines grounding fleets and laying off employees due to decreased passenger numbers and revenues. This article compares the recovery of airlines in Canada to five other large countries: Russia, the USA, China, Brazil, and Australia. Canada's recovery started slowly, remaining 88% below pre-pandemic levels in June 2021, but improved by the end of the year. Domestic market size had a limited impact on recovery, as countries with larger domestic markets, such as the US and Brazil, did not have faster recoveries. Government restrictions on travel and other activities likely played a role in the speed of recovery, but other pandemic-related factors like vaccination rates and economic conditions also influenced it. By December 2021, Russia, the US, and Brazil had the smallest declines in passenger numbers compared to 2019, while Australia had the largest decline and Canada was in the middle. The article concludes that the recovery of the domestic market, rather than its relative size, drives the overall recovery of the aviation industry. Important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Government restrictions: The stringency of government restrictions on travel and other activities can impact the speed of recovery. Relaxing restrictions may lead to an increase in travel demand and a potential rise in hospitalizations if not managed carefully. Vaccination rates: Vaccination status can influence hospitalization rates. Higher vaccination rates may result in lower hospitalization numbers, while regions with lower vaccination rates may experience higher hospitalizations. Economic conditions: People's economic situations can affect their travel decisions. Improved economic conditions may lead to increased travel, potentially impacting hospitalization forecasts. Previous waves: Analyzing previous waves of the virus and their impact on hospitalizations can provide insights into future waves. Understanding the correlation between infection rates and hospitalizations can help forecast the healthcare system's capacity needs. Domestic market recovery: Monitoring the recovery of the domestic market can provide insights into overall recovery trends and help anticipate potential increases in travel-related hospitalizations.

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article presents a survey analysis of attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic in 19 advanced economies. Here is a summary of the key points: 1. Overall Satisfaction with COVID-19 Response: A median of 68% of respondents across the 19 countries believe their country has done a good job in handling the pandemic, with the highest approval ratings in Singapore and Sweden. 2. Perceived Division in Society: A median of 61% feel their society is more divided now than before the pandemic, with the United States having the highest share of this view at 81%. Only Singapore, Sweden, and Malaysia report majorities feeling more united. 3. Exposure of Political System Weaknesses: A median of 52% believe the pandemic has revealed weaknesses in their political systems, with the highest proportion in the US at 66%. Singapore, Hungary, Israel, and Sweden are seen as effectively handling the pandemic, showcasing their political strengths. 4. Partisan Divide: In almost every country, supporters of the governing party are much more likely to approve of their government's pandemic response and perceive unity and political strength. This divide is especially prominent in Poland, with substantial differences in opinions between supporters and non-supporters of the governing party. 5. Importance of Vaccination: A majority in every country view getting vaccinated as important for being a good member of society, but the level of importance varies. Partisan differences are also evident, with supporters of governing parties generally emphasizing vaccination more. 6. Country Comparisons: The US stands out for its high levels of perceived division and belief that the pandemic exposed political failings. Belgium, Spain, Japan, France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Canada have improved their pandemic response ratings since 2021. Singapore and Australia have seen slight declines in their ratings. 7. Economic Factors: Positive views of the economy are associated with higher approval of the government's pandemic response. However, unlike in 2021, there is no clear relationship between pandemic response ratings and the number of virus-related deaths, cases, or vaccination rates in 2022. Overall, the article highlights varying levels of satisfaction with COVID-19 responses, perceived societal division, and exposure of political system weaknesses across the surveyed countries, with partisan differences playing a significant role in shaping attitudes.

Title: New study further demonstrates COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe during pregnancy
Publisher: UBC Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
A new study provides additional evidence of the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy and the first month postpartum. The study, conducted by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, found no obvious safety concerns for pregnant people or their babies during the period when COVID-19 mRNA vaccines became available. The findings were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study examined medical records data from six integrated health care organizations in diverse regions of the country. The researchers reviewed data from 46,079 pregnant individuals, including 10,042 who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during pregnancy and 36,037 who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The researchers then compared the rates of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes between the two groups. The study found that pregnant individuals with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, and their babies were more likely to require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or have respiratory complications. However, no significant differences in adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes were observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant individuals. The study also examined rates of vaccine-associated adverse events, such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (blood clots with a low blood platelet count). These events were rare in both pregnant and recently pregnant individuals, and the researchers did not observe an increased risk of these events after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy or the first month postpartum. "This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy," said Christine Olson, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a researcher in CDC's Division of Vaccine Safety. "We are continuing to conduct safety studies on COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, including longer-term follow-up of pregnant individuals and their infants, to help people make informed decisions about vaccination." Based on this and other data, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for people who are pregnant, recently pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or might become pregnant in the future. "Pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and vaccination is the safest, most effective way to decrease this risk," said Col. Michael Erickson, M.D., one of the study authors and a medical officer in CDC's COVID-19 Response Incident Management System. "CDC will continue to work with healthcare providers and medical professional societies to share data on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy." This study was conducted using VSD data from December 14, 2020, to June 28, 2021. CDC and VSD are continuing to analyze more recent data and plan to publish more findings on vaccine safety during pregnancy in the future.

Title: Ontario detects 96 COVID-19 deaths in past 7 days
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Despite 96 new COVID-19 deaths in Ontario over the past week, some key indicators suggest the pandemic may be easing. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have decreased slightly over the past week, with 1,382 people admitted, down from 1,474 last week. However, the number of people in intensive care has increased slightly, with 142 people in the ICU. The positivity rate remains high but has not changed from the previous day, indicating a possible plateau. The average weekly positivity rate has also decreased. Wastewater viral prevalence, an early indicator of COVID-19 spread, is increasing in some areas like the GTA and southwestern Ontario but decreasing in others. Regarding vaccinations, in the past week, 162,575 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered, with a notable number of fourth doses (117,784) given to adults. While the decrease in hospitalizations and average weekly positivity rate are positive signs, it is important to continue monitoring the situation, especially with the increasing wastewater viral prevalence in certain regions. The high positivity rate also indicates that COVID-19 is still actively spreading in the community. Therefore, a cautious approach should be maintained to help forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations effectively.

Title: Enduring colonialism has made it harder to end the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need to decolonize transnational governance to effectively manage global crises. It highlights the failure of COVAX, a global initiative aimed at equitable vaccine distribution, due to the hoarding of vaccine doses by rich countries while poor countries become breeding grounds for new variants. The article traces the colonial roots of global capitalism and racial classifications, which have led to the current gap between rich and poor countries and the racialization of the latter. It criticizes the lack of transparency and accountability in the design of COVAX, which was conceived by global vaccination networks dominated by the Global North. The article calls for decolonizing crisis governance by embracing equity, inclusion, and solidarity to effectively address current and future global challenges, including new pandemics and climate change crises. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors are important to consider: 1. Vaccination rates: The article highlights the disparity in vaccination rates between rich and poor countries, with over 80% of people in rich countries fully vaccinated compared to less than 10% in poor countries. Higher vaccination rates can help reduce the severity of the disease and lower the risk of hospitalization. 2. New variants: The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as those first spotted in South Africa, can impact the effectiveness of vaccines and increase the risk of hospitalization. Monitoring the spread of new variants and their impact on disease severity is crucial. 3. Healthcare infrastructure: The capacity of healthcare systems in different countries varies significantly. Poor countries often have weaker healthcare infrastructure, which can lead to higher hospitalization rates as they may lack the resources to effectively manage a surge in cases. 4. Social and economic factors: The pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized communities, and social and economic inequalities can impact access to healthcare and the risk of severe disease. These factors should be considered when forecasting hospitalizations. 5. Previous wave data: Analyzing data from previous pandemic waves can provide insights into hospitalization trends and help identify factors that contribute to increased hospitalizations. By considering these factors and incorporating local context, public health officials and researchers can forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems.

Title: 90% of People Who Lose Sense of Smell from COVID-19 Recover in 2 Years
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19-related smell and taste loss have affected approximately 27 million people worldwide, with some individuals experiencing these symptoms for over six months. However, new research provides encouraging news, suggesting that most patients will recover their sense of smell and taste within two years. This is based on a study conducted by researchers in Italy and the UK, which found that around 90% of mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients with smell or taste loss regained these senses fully within two years. It is important to note that the loss of smell and taste was more prevalent with earlier variants of COVID-19, and fewer people are reporting these issues with the Omicron variant. The article also highlights that the recovery of these senses may continue for many months, providing reassurance to patients dealing with long-term symptoms. Additionally, the article discusses the broader impacts of sensory loss, including reduced enjoyment of food, negative effects on weight and nutrition, and a decrease in overall quality of life. Sensory loss can also impact safety, as smell is crucial for detecting dangers such as fire or spoiled food. While the exact mechanisms of COVID-19's impact on smell and taste are still being studied, the article presents several theories. These include the effect of the virus on cells in the nasal lining and taste buds, as well as the role of the immune system's inflammatory response. To help regain the sense of smell, smell-retraining therapy is suggested, which involves sniffing strong scents while concentrating on the memory of the smell. The effectiveness of nasal and oral steroids for this purpose is still under investigation. This article provides valuable insights into the long-term effects of COVID-19 and offers hope for individuals experiencing prolonged smell and taste loss. The findings suggest that most people will recover their senses over time, and highlight the importance of managing the broader impacts of sensory loss during the recovery process.

Title: Ontario's 7th wave of COVID-19 has peaked, says top doctor
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The seventh wave of COVID-19 in Ontario appears to have peaked, with key indicators such as hospitalizations and wastewater data showing a downward trend. The province's chief medical officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, expects the overall risk and impact on the health sector to continue decreasing through August. While a fall wave of COVID-19 was initially predicted to be severe, Moore now believes it may not be as bad due to high infection rates from the Omicron variant, immunization rates, and the lack of a new variant. Reinfection with Omicron is still possible, but vaccination provides additional protection. In Ontario, just under 16% of adults have received a fourth dose of the vaccine, and vaccine uptake for children under five has been low, with only 1% of that age group receiving their first shot.
