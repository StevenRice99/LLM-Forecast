Title: Just How Do Deaths Due to COVID-19 Stack Up?
Publisher: Think Global Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article presents an analysis of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death worldwide and the factors contributing to its impact. Here is a summary: As of the end of December 2019, COVID-19 has killed over 7.3 million people globally, with high death tolls in the US, Russia, Brazil, and India. These numbers are likely underestimates, with some estimates suggesting the true death toll could be over 18 million. COVID-19 was the fifth leading cause of death globally based on official statistics, but after accounting for unreported deaths, it could be as high as the third, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths. The virus disproportionately affects older adults, with people over 70 facing an elevated risk of mortality. Country age structures contribute significantly to mortality rate variations between countries. In 2021, about 3.9 million COVID-19 deaths occurred, making it the deadliest year for the disease, likely due to the emergence of the deadly Delta variant. China's abrupt shift in zero-COVID policy may have major implications for 2023, with a forecasting model predicting at least a million deaths in the country. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in several countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Italy, and France, after considering unreported deaths. Countries like China, Taiwan, Thailand, and New Zealand acted swiftly and effectively to control the spread, keeping death counts relatively low. The Americas and Europe accounted for about 75% of reported COVID-19 deaths, despite representing only a quarter of the global population. However, their share of estimated total deaths was lower due to underreporting in other regions. Age pyramids differ across WHO regions, with a significant portion of people over 70 living in the Western Pacific and European regions. Underreporting of COVID-19 deaths is particularly prominent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to lower rankings of COVID-19 as a cause of death in these regions. Contextual and population health factors, such as age patterns, country wealth, and average BMI, contribute to variations in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries. The US has the highest COVID-19 death toll globally, with 1.1 million deaths, and a high death rate, despite significant vaccine purchases. COVID-19 is likely to remain a leading infectious cause of death globally, and strengthening surveillance systems, improving public health infrastructure, and expanding vaccine availability and uptake are crucial to mitigate its spread. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 as a cause of death worldwide and highlights the importance of considering underreported deaths and regional variations in understanding its true toll.

Title: Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Bow Valley News and Information
Publisher: Rocky Mountain Outlook - Bow Valley News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a new tool developed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. The tool uses waste water data and can predict hospital admissions a week in advance with up to 90% accuracy. This is significant as it allows healthcare facilities to prepare for incoming COVID-19 patients and allocate resources effectively. The method involves analyzing waste water samples for viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. By studying the concentration of these fragments, researchers can estimate the number of infections in a community, including asymptomatic cases, which make up around 40% of total infections. This provides a more comprehensive view than relying solely on confirmed cases reported through testing. The team at UCLA, in collaboration with the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts and the University of California, Berkeley, collected waste water samples from 65 sites across Los Angeles County. They found that the waste water data accurately predicted the rise and fall of COVID-19 hospitalizations a week before these trends were visible in clinical data. According to the article, the tool has already been implemented by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and is aiding in their decision-making process regarding hospital staffing and bed availability. The researchers plan to expand the project to cover all of California and are also working on similar initiatives in Missouri and Wisconsin. This waste water surveillance method is an innovative way to track the spread of COVID-19 and can provide valuable insights to public health officials and healthcare providers. It demonstrates the importance of waste water analysis in disease surveillance and could potentially be applied to other infectious diseases in the future.

Title: Information for patients: A guide to antigen self-testing for COVID-19
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Antigen self-testing is a method to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These tests look for proteins from the virus, while molecular tests (PCR) detect its genetic material. Self-testing allows individuals to test themselves or their dependants. It's important to read and follow the instructions provided with the test kit for accurate results. The test result may be positive, negative, or invalid. A positive result indicates the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and individuals should follow local public health guidelines for self-isolation and report the result to the local health authority. Even without symptoms, one could still spread the virus. A negative result means SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, but it does not rule out infection. To increase the accuracy of a negative result, retesting is recommended after 48 hours, especially if symptoms are present. An invalid result means the test did not work properly, and a new test is required. It is important to follow local public health guidelines and properly dispose of the used test components to minimize risk to others. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is crucial to consider the positivity rate in a given population. A high positivity rate may indicate widespread infection and could lead to an increase in hospitalizations. Additionally, understanding the incubation period of COVID-19 is important. On average, symptoms appear 5-6 days after exposure, but can take up to 14 days. This information can help predict the number of hospitalizations in the coming weeks. Other factors, such as vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, and the availability of medical resources, also play a role in forecasting hospitalizations.

The article presents the results of a study conducted by the National Institutes of Health and published in JAMA Network Open, which found that many adults hospitalized with COVID-19 experience lingering symptoms, financial difficulties, and physical limitations months after being discharged. The study followed 825 adults who received treatment for COVID-19 at 44 medical centers in the United States between August 2020 and July 2021 and were surveyed at one, three, and six months after leaving the hospital. Key findings from the study include: Six months after hospitalization, 75% of patients reported at least one cardiopulmonary issue such as coughing, rapid heartbeat, or breathlessness. Fatigue was also common, with 51% of patients feeling tired compared to 41% at one month. 56% of patients experienced financial difficulties such as being unable to pay bills. 47% of patients reported limitations in everyday activities. Symptoms waxed and waned, with some patients experiencing intervals of recovery and relapse. The study highlights the long-term impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized patients and suggests that many may experience symptoms and challenges for up to six months or longer. This information is important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it indicates that the impact of the disease extends far beyond the initial infection and treatment, and highlights the need for ongoing support and care for COVID-19 patients even after they are discharged from the hospital.

Title: WHO abandons plans for crucial second phase of COVID-origins investigation
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has abandoned the second phase of its investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic due to challenges conducting studies in China. Understanding the origins of the virus is crucial for preventing future outbreaks, but without access to information and locations in China, the WHO's efforts are hindered. The investigation began in January 2021 when a team of WHO experts traveled to Wuhan, China, to review evidence and work with Chinese researchers. The team's report outlined four possible scenarios for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, with the most likely being transmission from bats to people, possibly through an intermediate species. However, political tensions and disputes over the inclusion of a lab-incident scenario in the report hampered further progress. Chinese officials rejected the WHO's plans for phase two, specifically the investigation of lab breaches, and the necessary data for pinpointing the origin of the virus may no longer be accessible. Despite these setbacks, some studies proposed for phase two have been conducted independently, providing valuable insights into the early stages of the pandemic. The WHO has formed the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) to continue investigating the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and preparing for future outbreaks. While the exact origins of COVID-19 may remain uncertain, the ongoing efforts of researchers and the WHO aim to improve our understanding and preparedness for similar events.

Title: Verified: COVID-19 Infection Increases Diabetes Risk
Publisher: Cedars-Sinai
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a study conducted at Cedars-Sinai's Smidt Heart Institute, confirming that individuals who have had COVID-19 are at an increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes, a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease. The study found that the risk of Type 2 diabetes persists even in the Omicron era. Vaccination against COVID-19 prior to infection may lower the risk of developing diabetes post-infection. The research, published in JAMA Network Open, analyzed medical records of 23,709 adult patients with COVID-19 within the Cedars-Sinai Health System. The study revealed that the combined risk of Type 2 diabetes after COVID-19 exposure was 2.1%, with a higher risk for unvaccinated patients compared to vaccinated individuals. The study suggests that COVID-19 infection could accelerate the risk of developing diabetes, potentially leading to earlier diagnoses than expected. Diabetes can impact vital organs and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. The research aims to provide insights into preventing metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks associated with COVID-19. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing the long-term health effects of COVID-19, emphasizing the significance of vaccination in reducing the risk of diabetes and other related conditions.

Title: Common Questions About Bivalent COVID-19 Boosters
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article encourages eligible individuals to receive the bivalent COVID-19 booster dose, addressing common concerns and providing relevant information. Here are the key points summarized: The bivalent booster is important because it offers protection against the original strain of the virus and the more contagious Omicron variants. The booster helps individuals recover faster and reduces the likelihood of hospitalization, even with newer variants like BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5. Side effects from the vaccine are normal and indicate a proper immune response. These side effects may be mitigated by switching vaccine brands or consulting a doctor for medication recommendations. Thousands are still hospitalized daily due to COVID-19, so getting the booster is important despite individual risk factors. The time investment for the booster is worth it to reduce potential sick days from COVID-19. The CDC provides guidelines and tools to help individuals determine their vaccination and booster status. Vaccination is not just about individual health but also about protecting vulnerable individuals in the community. For more information, individuals can refer to the CDC, local health departments, and their doctors for personalized advice.

Title: Updates in the Law on Vaccinating Children Against COVID-19
Publisher: Clark Wilson LLP
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article discusses a recent decision by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Canada, which overturned a lower court ruling and granted a father limited decision-making authority to have his children vaccinated against COVID-19. The case highlights the polarizing nature of COVID-19 vaccines in family law and the standards for admitting evidence in such cases. Here are the key points: COVID-19 vaccines have been a controversial topic in family law, with some parents favoring vaccination and others objecting. In a previous case, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled in favor of the mother, who had sole decision-making authority and objected to vaccinating her children. The father had applied for an order to vaccinate the children, but the judge refused. The Court of Appeal set aside the lower court's decision, criticizing the mother's reliance on unreliable internet sources and self-proclaimed experts. The court clarified that the onus is on the parent objecting to provide valid evidence and a compelling argument against a Health Canada-approved medication. The father presented evidence from the Government of Canada, which the original judge wrongly dismissed, drawing inappropriate analogies to historical events. This case sets a precedent for similar situations, with Ontario's highest court clearly articulating that the burden of proof lies with the parent objecting to vaccination (or any Health Canada-approved medication). This article does not contain information that would directly help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, it does provide insight into the legal and parental perspectives surrounding COVID-19 vaccine decisions, which could indirectly impact hospitalization rates as vaccine uptake among children may be influenced by such court rulings.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article highlights concerns raised by Nova Scotian Judy Aymar about the lack of acknowledgment and condolences for COVID-19 deaths in the province. Aymar, a retired social worker, worries that the deaths of seniors are being treated as mere statistics rather than the loss of valued community members. The article also presents perspectives from a professor at Dalhousie University, Robert Huish, and the senior Nova Scotia spokesperson for CARP, Bill VanGorder, who echo concerns about the vulnerability of seniors and the shift in public health messaging. According to the province's data, Nova Scotians aged 70 and older have a COVID-19 death rate 280 times higher than those under 50. The median age of death during the Omicron wave is 84. Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Robert Strang, expresses condolences and emphasizes the continued importance of collective action to protect vulnerable populations. Important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations include: The high death rate among Nova Scotians aged 70 and older, which is 280 times higher than those under 50. The median age of death during the Omicron wave is 84, indicating a continued risk for seniors. The province's data also shows that hospitalizations for those 70 and older are almost 19 times higher than for people aged 18 to 49. With COVID-19 restrictions lifted, seniors are particularly vulnerable, relying mainly on vaccines and individual choices for protection. Public health campaigns can experience fatigue, leading to a shift in focus from collective duty to individual choice and responsibility. The province has been communicating the importance of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines through various media channels since September.
