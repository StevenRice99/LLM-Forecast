TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir–ritonavir) is an antiviral medication that has been proven to lower the risk of COVID-19-related death and hospitalization among those likely to experience severe illness. The study found that for every 62 people treated with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, one case of severe COVID-19 was prevented. The study focused on patients older than 70 years of age and vaccinated, which is a key demographic for forecasting hospitalizations in Ontario. The study's lead author, Dr. Kevin Schwartz, emphasizes the importance of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and access to Paxlovid for those at risk for severe COVID-19. The article also mentions that Paxlovid offers no benefit to people who were at much lower risk of serious illness, which is important to consider when forecasting hospitalizations. These findings can inform forecasting models by highlighting the effectiveness of Paxlovid in reducing hospitalizations and severe illness among high-risk populations, which can help predict the number of hospitalizations in Ontario.
