Here is a summary of the article: Title: Understanding and Supporting Student Mental Health during COVID-19 Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of post-secondary students, exacerbating existing stressors and vulnerabilities. McMaster University, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), has launched a survey to understand students' experiences and develop support solutions. The study, led by sociologist and mental health researcher Marisa Young, aims to gather data from 21 universities across 15 countries for regional and cross-cultural analysis. Young discusses the three-pronged attack of COVID-19 on mental health: ambient stress, loss of psychological resources, and exacerbation of existing stressors. The chronic stress of the pandemic is expected to lead to further mental health issues, similar to the gradual collapse of a bridge under continuous strain. University students face unique challenges, and the pandemic has intensified these stressors, potentially resulting in unprecedented distress. Tips for students to cope with pandemic stress include maintaining social connections, creating routines, and seeking professional support. Key Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: The pandemic's prolonged duration, especially with the emergence of new variants and subsequent waves, will likely result in a sustained increase in mental health issues, which could lead to more hospitalizations. The loss of jobs, financial stressors, and lack of childcare options during lockdowns have been significant contributing factors to mental health problems. University students, already facing unique stressors, are at an increased risk of mental health issues, which may require specialized support services and resources. Overall, the article highlights the potential for a wave of mental health issues, particularly among students, as an indirect consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could have significant implications for healthcare systems and hospitalization rates in the coming months and years.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hours worked in Canada, analyzing data by industry, province, and firm size. The analysis is based on the Labour Force Survey, comparing hours worked in 2020 with the average hours worked from 2017 to 2019 as a baseline. Overall, Canadian workers reduced their hours worked by up to 25% compared to the baseline in April 2020. The services sector was more affected than the goods sector, with the arts, entertainment, accommodation, and food services industries experiencing the most significant losses of about 65% in April and a partial recovery to 55% in June. Across provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia saw the largest reductions in hours relative to their baselines. The lockdown restrictions caused significant variations across provinces. Firms with fewer than 20 employees were the most severely impacted across all industries. In most industries, these smaller firms experienced the largest or second-largest reductions in hours worked. The article concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic had heterogeneous effects on hours worked in Canada, underscoring the importance of understanding these differences for policy responses and forecasting future labor market trends. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide direct information. However, understanding the impact of reduced hours worked on the economy and labor market can indirectly influence hospitalization rates. Reduced hours worked may lead to changes in income, healthcare access, and healthcare-seeking behavior, which could impact hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and other health conditions.

Title: COVID-19 exposed the digital divide. Here's how we can close it
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article emphasizes the importance of bridging the digital divide, particularly in providing 5G access to rural and low-income communities. This is crucial in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as reliable internet access enables remote learning and works, helping to slow the spread of the virus. Here are some key facts and figures from the article to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: In rural areas of the US, only 65% of people have access to high-speed internet, compared to 97% in urban areas. In the US, 7% of poor eighth-graders lack internet access, compared to only 1.6% of non-poor students, per the National Center for Education Statistics. The digital divide can have economic repercussions, with people lacking robust internet access being left behind economically. The development of 5G infrastructure is a massive undertaking, requiring a multitude of additional cellular towers and new distributed architectures. Public-private collaborations and investments from major IT and cloud companies are crucial to expanding 5G access. 5G technology has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including education, healthcare, transportation, and public services. While the article does not provide direct data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, the information presented could be relevant in forecasting hospitalizations. The digital divide's impact on remote learning and work could influence the spread of the virus and, consequently, hospitalization rates. Additionally, the potential for 5G technology to enhance healthcare and public services could indirectly affect hospitalization forecasts over time.

Title: Nepal’s Challenges in Delivering Education Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the education of over 90% of students worldwide, with 1 in 5 children lacking access to schooling even before the pandemic. Nepal, a South Asian country with 28.6 million people, is struggling to provide quality education due to structural challenges and limited technological infrastructure. The pandemic has further exacerbated these issues. In March 2020, the Nepali government closed all schools and colleges to curb the spread of COVID-19. While some schools have recently reopened with safety measures in place, remote learning remains challenging due to uneven access to the internet and computers. Only 12% of public schools have the capacity for online learning. Organizations like Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal are working to bridge the digital divide by distributing computers and interactive learning software and providing teacher training. Nepal's transition to a federal system from a unitary government has also impacted the education sector. The lack of coordination between decision-makers at different levels of government and insufficient resources for local authorities have hindered the response to the pandemic. Additionally, there is a dearth of up-to-date and accurate data on the impact of the pandemic on students and teachers, making it difficult to address existing disparities in the education system effectively. The pandemic's impact on girls' education and education in urban and rural settings in Nepal is not fully understood, but researchers speculate that it has been disproportionately negative. Fostering partnerships for gender-sensitive responses and local-level initiatives are crucial to addressing these disparities. Nepal's challenges are shared by other South Asian countries, with varying capacities to provide quality education to disadvantaged populations. Digital learning is inaccessible to nearly 38% of school children in the region. While online interventions are favored by governments, offline initiatives like television and radio have the potential to reach a wider audience. Nepal can learn from India's example of encouraging local government discretion in implementing educational initiatives and Bangladesh's unified governance approach, which was well-positioned to respond to COVID-induced school closures. Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities for different levels of government and adequate resources for local authorities are key to improving Nepal's response to the pandemic's impact on education.

Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, led by Drs. Daniela Weiskopf, Alessandro Sette, and Shane Crotty, conducted a study to better understand the immune memory of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The study included almost 200 participants who had been exposed to the virus and recovered. The researchers found that the immune systems of more than 95% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had a durable memory of the virus up to eight months after infection. The study focused on analyzing immune cells and antibodies in the participants, with time since infection ranging from six days to eight months. The results showed that the majority of people developed durable immune responses, with high levels of antibodies, B cells, and T cells that recognized and fought the virus. Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were found in 98% of participants one month after symptoms, and their levels remained stable over time. B cells, which produce new antibodies, increased over time, and T cells that recognized and fought the virus remained high, with 92% of participants having CD4+ T cells six months after symptoms. The findings provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will also develop lasting immune memories after vaccination. The research suggests that natural infection induces a strong and long-lasting immune response, which is encouraging for the development of vaccine-induced immunity. These results can help in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by providing insight into the duration of immunity after infection and the potential for long-lasting protection through vaccination.

Title: COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care highlight the urgent need for paid sick leave
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article highlights the need for addressing the crisis in long-term care homes, which has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the start of vaccination efforts in Ontario is welcome news, the author argues that a successful vaccination campaign alone will not end the crisis. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the sector, with 81% of COVID-19 deaths in Canada during the first wave occurring in long-term care homes. The novel coronavirus is an occupational disease, and the crisis in long-term care reflects the precarious working conditions of its predominantly racialized, immigrant, and female workforce. The article goes on to discuss how precarious employees often work multiple sites and face financial penalties for missing work, creating an incentive to continue working even when sick or exposed to COVID-19. Current government support, such as federal employment insurance sickness benefits and the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, are insufficient and do not provide enough incentive for precariously employed, low-wage workers to stay home when sick. As a result, the author emphasizes the need for policies that support these workers, specifically highlighting the importance of paid sick days for all as a matter of health equity. The Decent Work and Health Network, along with various health professionals and officials, have advocated for paid sick days to address the current crisis and create a healthier and more equitable society. Dr. Teresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has identified economic and employment insecurity and a lack of paid sick leave as significant factors in the long-term care crisis. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table's report also recommends improved working conditions and guaranteed paid sick leave to reduce outbreaks and deaths in long-term care homes. The article concludes that addressing precarious work and providing paid sick days are essential complements to the COVID-19 vaccine in the effort to create a healthier and more resilient society.

Title: A year later, Indigenous communities are fighting twin crises: COVID-19 and inequality
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
As of January 21, 2021, Indigenous Services Canada reported 14,488 confirmed COVID-19 cases on First Nations reserves, with over 5,300 active cases and 618 hospitalizations. The rate of reported cases among First Nations living on reserves is 40% higher than the general Canadian population, and systemic inequalities in health, housing, and social services have magnified the impact of COVID-19 in these communities. There is also a lack of cell reception and virtual care infrastructure, which has hindered the healthcare response. The Canadian government has pledged $1.2 billion in new funding to support Indigenous communities, including $630 million for staff, PPE, and facility adaptations, and $186 million for home care services for elders and vulnerable members. The case numbers and systemic issues highlight the ongoing challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Canada, with doctors noting that the pandemic has brought racism and healthcare disparities to the forefront.

Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is a timeline of the key developments in the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, starting from the first presumptive case on January 25, 2020. Here are some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: On January 27, 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Canada was announced. By March 11, 2020, Canada had more than 100 cases, and the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The first death in Canada due to COVID-19 was reported on March 8, 2020, in North Vancouver. On April 2, 2020, the COVID-19 death toll in Canada surpassed 100. On April 9, 2020, the federal government projected that between 4,400 and 44,000 Canadians could die from COVID-19. The death toll surpassed 5,000 on May 12, 2020. Canada officially recorded more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 on June 18, 2020. On October 19, 2020, Canada's case count surpassed 200,000. On November 16, 2020, Canada's case count topped 300,000. Canada surpassed 500,000 total cases on December 20, 2020, and 15,000 deaths on December 28, 2020. On January 3, 2021, Canada surpassed 600,000 total cases, and on January 16, 2021, the country surpassed 700,000 cases. These milestones and case counts can provide a general sense of the trajectory of the pandemic in Canada and help forecast hospitalizations. However, it's important to consider other factors as well, such as the availability of hospital beds, intensive care capacity, and the percentage of the population that is vaccinated.

Title: Spartan Bioscience says Health Canada approves rapid COVID-19 test
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Spartan Bioscience, an Ottawa-based company, has received approval from Health Canada for its rapid COVID-19 test, which is one of the few approved quick-result tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This method is considered the most accurate for COVID-19 diagnostics. The test can deliver on-site results within 50-60 minutes, making it a valuable tool for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in various settings such as hospitals, workplaces, remote communities, and schools. The test was initially approved in April 2020, but restrictions were imposed due to issues with the efficacy of tissue collection; these issues have now been addressed with standard nasopharyngeal swabs and improvements to the sample processing kit. Spartan Bioscience currently has a manufacturing capacity of 60,000 tests per week but aims to increase this to 200,000 in the future. The approval of this rapid test is significant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it enables quicker identification and isolation of positive cases, potentially reducing the strain on healthcare resources.
