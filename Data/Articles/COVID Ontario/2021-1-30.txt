This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Janssen's single-shot vaccine is 66% effective overall in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination. The vaccine is 85% effective in preventing severe disease after 28 days across all geographical regions. The vaccine demonstrated complete protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. The vaccine's efficacy increased over time, with zero cases reported in vaccinated participants after the 49th day. The vaccine's logistical benefits, such as being compatible with standard distribution channels and remaining stable for two years at -20°C (-4°F), make it a promising option for global vaccination efforts. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccine efficacy in preventing severe disease (85%) Vaccine efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths (100%) Timeframe for vaccine effectiveness (28 days) Logistical benefits of the vaccine (compatibility with standard distribution channels, stability at -20°C (-4°F)) These values can be used to inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly in scenarios where vaccination efforts are being implemented.

Title: Highly-contagious U.K. COVID-19 variant will likely be dominant strain in Ontario by March, modelling suggests

Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 cases are declining in Ontario, but the new highly-contagious U.K. variant poses a significant threat and is expected to be the dominant strain by March. Hospitalizations have decreased, but ICU capacity remains strained, with 358 patients currently being treated for COVID-19 in ICUs. Health officials expect ICU capacity to decrease to between 150 and 300 patients by the end of February. Modelling data suggests that if public health interventions are maintained, Ontario should see a continued reduction in cases, even with a return to school. The stay-at-home order has resulted in only a small reduction in overall mobility in the province. COVID-19 vaccines are likely still effective against the U.K. strain, but future variants may not work with current vaccines. Cases are declining in long-term care homes, but deaths continue to rise. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Current ICU capacity: 358 patients Expected ICU capacity by end of February: 150-300 patients Daily case rate: 1% decline would result in 1,700 new cases per day by end of February, 3% decline would result in under 1,000 new cases per day Number of long-term care deaths in previous 7 days: 215 Total number of COVID-19 deaths in Ontario: over 6,000 These values provide insight into the current state of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario and can inform forecasting models to predict future hospitalization rates.

This article provides a timeline of key developments in the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, including cases, deaths, and government responses. While it does not provide direct forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, it does offer some relevant information that could be useful for forecasting, such as: Dates of key events, such as the first confirmed case, first death, and implementation of various public health measures Case and death counts at various points in time, which could be used to understand the trajectory of the pandemic Information on government responses, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and vaccination efforts, which could impact hospitalization rates However, the article does not provide detailed data on hospitalizations specifically, nor does it offer any explicit forecasts or models for predicting hospitalization rates. Therefore, its usefulness for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada is limited. Summary of relevant values: January 25, 2020: First presumptive case reported in Toronto March 8, 2020: First death reported in Canada April 3, 2020: Ontario projects COVID-19 death toll could reach 15,000 April 9, 2020: Ottawa projects 4,400 to 44,000 Canadians could die of COVID-19 December 14, 2020: First doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine administered in Quebec and Ontario January 3, 2021: Canada surpasses 600,000 total cases of COVID-19 January 11, 2021: Ontario's death toll surpasses 5,000 These values provide some context for understanding the pandemic's progression in Canada, but more specific data on hospitalizations would be needed to create accurate forecasts.

COVID-19 continued to pressure some local hospitals, prompting Ottawa to send two federal mobile health units to the Greater Toronto Area, adding an additional 200 hospital beds. The article mentions concerns about the spread of new COVID-19 variants, including 31 cases of the UK variant and three cases of the South African variant found in Canada. Vaccine supply is expected to be challenging in the next few weeks due to Pfizer-BioNTech slowing deliveries to Canada and other countries. Provinces have reported a total of 738,864 vaccine doses used so far, with about 80% of the available supply used. These values can be used to inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, by taking into account the recent trends in case numbers, hospitalizations, and vaccine supply, as well as the potential impact of new variants and travel restrictions.
