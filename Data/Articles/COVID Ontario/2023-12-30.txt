Article 1 of 10
Title: Coronavirus (COVID-19) | Drugs
Publisher: FDA.gov
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article explains the difference between FDA-approved drugs and those authorized for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the context of COVID-19. FDA-approved drugs have undergone rigorous evaluation and are deemed safe and effective for their intended use, with benefits outweighing risks. On the other hand, EUA is a mechanism that allows the FDA to authorize the use of unapproved products during public health emergencies when there are no adequate alternatives. For a drug to receive FDA approval, substantial evidence of its effectiveness is required. In contrast, EUA requires a lower level of evidence, considering the totality of the scientific evidence available. The FDA determines if the potential benefits of a product outweigh its risks for diagnosing, treating, or preventing a serious or life-threatening disease. The article also mentions that the FDA can revise or revoke EUAs, for example, when a drug receives full approval or when necessary to protect public health. It provides links to resources with information on EUA vaccine and therapeutic products, product fact sheets, and updates on shelf-life extensions for some EUA products. Understanding the distinction between FDA-approved drugs and those under EUA is essential for healthcare professionals and patients. It helps to ensure informed decisions about the use of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, considering their effectiveness, benefits, and risks. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the availability and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines play a crucial role. FDA-approved drugs and those under EUA can influence hospitalization rates by reducing the severity of the disease and preventing serious complications. Monitoring the utilization and impact of these treatments can provide valuable data for forecasting hospitalizations and managing healthcare resources effectively.

Title: What caused the high inflation during the COVID-19 period? : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
Publisher: Bureau of Labor Statistics
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the causes of high inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic and presents the findings of a conference paper by Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard. The pandemic significantly impacted the global economy, with the US economy losing 23 million jobs initially and entering a recession in early 2020. The federal government and Federal Reserve responded with increased fiscal spending and near-zero interest rates, respectively. While the economy started to recover, inflation rose to its highest level in decades, sparking debates among economists. Bernanke and Blanchard analyze the factors contributing to high inflation and divide policy analysts into "inflation optimists" and "critics." They introduce a model focusing on wages, prices, and shortand long-term inflation expectations and examine data from pre-COVID and COVID periods. They find that shocks to food and energy prices significantly contributed to the rise in inflation during the COVID period, with energy price shocks being the primary cause until mid-2022. Increased demand for durables and supply chain disruptions also played a role in inflation. While tight labor market conditions were a concern for critics of fiscal and monetary policy, Bernanke and Blanchard find that it contributed only slightly to inflation. However, they note that the tight labor market negatively affected the economy in 2020 and early 2021, and the traditional Phillips-curve effect has started to reemerge, with the high vacancy-to-unemployment ratio influencing inflation rates. They conclude that product market price shocks initially caused the rise in inflation, but labor market tightness became the main persistent factor as it began to overheat in 2022. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not directly provide information on that topic. However, understanding the economic impact of the pandemic and the subsequent policy responses is crucial for predicting healthcare utilization. The fiscal and monetary policy decisions influenced healthcare resources and access, which could impact hospitalizations during the pandemic.

Title: Waterloo Region COVID-19 booster uptake below national average
Publisher: CTV News Kitchener
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the low uptake of COVID-19 booster shots in Waterloo Region, Canada, compared to the national rate. As of December 9, only 10.9% of residents in Waterloo Region have received a COVID-19 booster dose in the last six months, while 14.6% of Canadians nationwide have received the latest version of the booster shot. This difference in uptake may be due to pandemic fatigue, a lack of concern about the virus, and the fact that COVID-19 has not recently caused severe illness in many people. However, it is important to note that vaccinations, along with proper handwashing and staying home when sick, are crucial to keeping people healthy during the respiratory illness season. Currently, there are 42 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Waterloo Region, which is lower than the 51 hospitalizations at the same time last year. The region is also experiencing outbreaks in congregate settings and long-term care homes. To stay healthy and reduce the risk of severe illness, residents are encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the flu, and RSV if they are 60 years of age or older. While cases and hospitalizations have decreased compared to the previous year, it is expected that gatherings over the holidays may lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 wastewater signal in Waterloo Region remains elevated, and fluctuations are expected from week to week. Overall, the low booster shot uptake in Waterloo Region may impact the region's ability to manage COVID-19 hospitalizations and cases in the coming months.

Title: Waterloo region's COVID booster rate lags behind national average
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 booster vaccination rate in Waterloo region is below the national average, with only 10.9% of residents up-to-date on their vaccinations as of December 7. This includes those who have received a booster dose within the previous six months. Additionally, 10.8% of people in the region have received the updated XBB.1.5 COVID-19 vaccine. An additional dose is recommended for 71% of the population, with higher percentages for adults between 18 and 50 years old. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist, attributes the low booster rates to a lack of awareness about the risks of COVID-19. During a regional council meeting on December 13, Waterloo's medical officer of health, Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, noted that COVID-19 continues to circulate in the community along with the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). She encouraged residents to get vaccinated against these respiratory illnesses to increase protection for themselves and their loved ones. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the low booster vaccination rates in the region. The low uptake of booster doses may lead to increased hospitalizations, especially among those who are vulnerable or at high risk of severe disease. Additionally, the circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as the flu and RSV, could further strain healthcare resources and impact hospitalization rates.

Title: Canada enters 5th year of COVID-19. Are we falling short in treatment? - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
As Canada enters its fifth year of dealing with COVID-19, there are concerns about the lack of adequate treatment options for the virus, especially for those suffering from long COVID. Long COVID refers to physical or psychological symptoms that persist more than 12 weeks after the initial infection, and there is currently no cure or effective treatment. The exact number of long COVID cases in Canada is unknown, but a Health Canada report found that over 17% of adults who had COVID-19 reported longer-term symptoms. Symptoms can vary widely and include extreme fatigue, difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, and stomach pain. The article features the story of Jennifer Hulme, an emergency physician who contracted long COVID in April 2022. She experienced severe cognitive impairment, disorientation, shortness of breath, and extreme fatigue. Despite seeking medical help, she was told there were limited evidence-based treatments and was advised to rest and take time off work. Hulme's experience highlights the need for better treatment options and specialized care for long COVID patients. Currently, Paxlovid, a mix of two anti-viral drugs, is the most common treatment option in Canada for mild to moderate COVID-19 cases to prevent severe illness. However, it is not a cure for long COVID and is not meant for long-term use. Other treatments, such as physiotherapy, anti-depressants, and metformin, may provide some relief but are not a magic bullet. Hulme and other patients are advocating for more long-COVID clinics to provide specialized care for the complex and multisystem nature of the condition. Experts agree that a holistic approach to treatment is necessary, involving a team of specialists such as internists, neurologists, and psychiatrists. However, the success of long COVID clinics has been varied, with wait lists being extremely long, and symptoms often subsiding before patients can access care. The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges the challenges of treating long COVID due to its wide range of symptoms and recommends a rehabilitation guideline that includes physiotherapy, pain education, short-term anti-inflammatory drugs, and mental health support. While there may not be a universally recognized standard of care yet, experts advise those affected to seek out local specialists to explore potential clinical trials and medications.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccine Cards: Do You Still Need One?
Publisher: Health.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
As of October 2023, the CDC has stopped issuing vaccine cards and will not maintain records of COVID-19 vaccinations. While you likely don't need to carry your vaccine card with you in public spaces anymore, it's still a good idea to keep it in a safe place as it documents your vaccination history. This may be useful in the future, especially when traveling or if businesses or certain venues start requiring proof of vaccination again. COVID is still evolving and circulating, so staying vigilant is important. You can take a picture of your card and store it digitally, but be careful not to share it on social media to prevent identity theft. If you've lost your card, you can obtain your vaccination records through the healthcare provider that administered your vaccine or through your state health department. The CDC also has a vaccine monitoring program called V-Safe that tracks side effects and symptoms post-vaccination. It's always a good idea to refer to the CDC for the most up-to-date guidelines and recommendations regarding COVID-19. While the public health emergency has ended, staying informed and taking necessary precautions can help us protect ourselves and others.

Title: Association between blood pressure and COVID-19 severity
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the relationship between blood pressure, hypertension, and COVID-19 severity, highlighting some important findings and unresolved questions. Here's a summary: There are concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood pressure due to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and changes in lifestyle habits. Hypertension has been associated with COVID-19 severity in some reports, but the relationship is not yet confirmed, and there are also reports of no association. In a study by Sakurai et al., pre-existing hypertension was linked to critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, but blood pressure levels at admission were not predictive of critical outcomes in those with pre-existing hypertension. However, high or low blood pressure and high pulse pressure at admission were associated with critical outcomes in patients without pre-existing hypertension. COVID-19 is considered a risk factor for the development of hypertension, and hypertension has been reported as a sequela of COVID-19 more frequently than in non-COVID-19 patients. The mechanisms for blood pressure elevation are not fully understood but may involve the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and reduced renal function. The impact of RAS inhibitors on COVID-19 severity is controversial, with conflicting results from clinical observational studies and randomized control trials. There is no consensus on whether to continue, discontinue, or introduce RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Differences in ACE2 expression due to sex, race, and ethnicity may play a role in the association between blood pressure and COVID-19 severity, and sex differences have also been reported in the efficacy of RAS inhibitors. Unresolved questions include the involvement of virus mutant strains, antihypertensive drugs, COVID-19 treatments, vaccination status, and the mechanisms linking blood pressure and COVID-19 severity. The article highlights the need for further research to clarify these relationships and guide clinical decision-making for patients with hypertension and COVID-19.

Title: As COVID-19 cases rise, WHO asks countries to scale up surveillance and protective measures
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 6 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning to countries in the South-East Asia Region to strengthen their surveillance and testing efforts as cases of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 and the new sub-variant JN.1, and influenza are on the rise. JN.1 has been classified as a variant of interest due to its rapid global spread, and while the additional health risk is currently considered low, the situation must be closely monitored. With the holiday season approaching, people are urged to take protective measures such as vaccination and timely clinical care if unwell, especially for those at high risk. WHO also emphasizes the continued effectiveness of approved COVID-19 vaccines in protecting against severe disease and death from all variants, including JN.1. While COVID-19 is no longer considered a public health emergency by WHO, countries must remain vigilant and maintain strong surveillance, sequencing, and reporting systems to effectively manage respiratory diseases and protect public health.
