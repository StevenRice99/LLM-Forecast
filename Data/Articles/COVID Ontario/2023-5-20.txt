Title: Statement on the antigen composition of COVID-19 vaccines
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) provides recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine composition to ensure that vaccines induce immune responses against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. As of May 2023, the XBB.1 descendent lineages, particularly XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16, predominate globally. These variants are highly immune evasive, with XBB.1.5 exhibiting significant escape from neutralizing antibodies. Current COVID-19 vaccines offer substantial protection against severe disease and death but limited and less durable protection against symptomatic illness. The TAG-CO-VAC reviewed evidence on SARS-CoV-2 evolution, vaccine effectiveness, antigenic relationships, and immune responses to make recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine updates. The key recommendations are as follows: New COVID-19 vaccine formulations should aim to induce antibody responses that neutralize XBB descendent lineages, as this will improve protection against symptomatic disease. A monovalent XBB.1 descendent lineage, such as XBB.1.5 or the closely related XBB.1.16, is recommended as the vaccine antigen. Other formulations or platforms that achieve robust neutralizing antibody responses against XBB descendent lineages can also be considered. The TAG-CO-VAC advises moving away from including the index virus in future vaccine formulations due to its absence in circulation and limited neutralizing antibody responses against current variants. The group encourages the generation of data on immune responses and clinical endpoints in humans receiving updated COVID-19 vaccines and further development of vaccines that enhance mucosal immunity to improve protection against infection and reduce transmission. Collaboration between multilateral organizations, governments, and manufacturers is imperative for ensuring equitable global access to updated COVID-19 vaccines. These recommendations aim to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and improve protection against COVID-19, particularly symptomatic disease.

Title: Drop in cancer diagnoses in 2020 possibly linked to COVID-19 disruptions: Statistics Canada
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a notable decline in new cancer diagnoses in 2020, attributed to pandemic-related disruptions in screening services. Statistics Canada reported a 12.3% drop in new cancer cases compared to the previous five-year average. The decrease was more significant in males (13.2%) than females (11.4%). Difficulties accessing primary care and reduced in-person appointments due to COVID-19 lockdowns may have impacted cancer registrations. After the initial lockdowns in 2020, the number of registered cancer cases dropped but later returned to or exceeded the previous average. The incidence rates of common cancer types like breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers were lower in 2020, while throat and anal cancer rates increased. The article highlights concerns from healthcare professionals about delayed cancer treatments during the pandemic, leading to advanced cases. Some patients avoided seeking care due to COVID-19 fears. Experts anticipate a rise in cancer mortality rates due to delayed diagnoses and treatments. Efforts are being made to address the backlog in cancer surgeries and treatments, including referrals to clinics in other regions. Overall, despite disruptions in cancer diagnoses in 2020, some cancer types saw higher incidence rates than the previous years. The impact of the pandemic on cancer care and mortality rates is a significant concern in the healthcare sector.

Title: Should You Get an Additional COVID-19 Bivalent Booster? > News > Yale Medicine
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: Updates on the COVID-19 Booster Shot Recommendations Key Points: The article provides an update on COVID-19 booster shot recommendations in the United States as of May 17, 2023. The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available in the US as of May 2023 due to expiration. While COVID-19 cases are dropping, the disease remains a concern for individuals aged 65 and older, and those with weak immune systems, as they are more susceptible to severe illness or death. The FDA and CDC offer a second bivalent booster shot from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, targeting Omicron subvariants and the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines can effectively prevent hospitalizations and deaths, with the majority of deaths occurring in individuals aged 50 and older. However, the uptake of the first bivalent shot is low, with only 42.4% of people 65 and older receiving it. The FDA plans to replace the original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with the current bivalent mRNA vaccines. In the fall, a reformulated booster will be offered to a wider age group, coinciding with the flu shot, based on recommendations for circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. Important Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Individuals aged 65 and older (over 53 million people in the US) and those with weak immune systems (about 7 million) are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. The low uptake of the first bivalent shot (42.4% in those 65 and older) could impact hospitalization rates if infection cases rise. The majority of COVID-19 deaths in the US have occurred in individuals aged 50 and older, with numbers increasing with age. The availability of the second bivalent booster shot may help reduce hospitalization and death rates in these high-risk groups. The article emphasizes the ongoing need for COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots to protect vulnerable individuals and mitigate the impact of the disease on hospitalizations.

Title: A muti-informant national survey on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health symptoms of parent–child dyads in Canada
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children, youth, and their parents based on a nationally representative survey. Key findings include: Over one-third of children, youth, and parents reported worsened mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Children and youth were less likely to report worsened mental health symptoms compared to their parents. Children and youth had less confidence in understanding mental health information accessed online. Parents reported significantly worse mental health symptoms than their children and youth. Loss of routine due to pandemic-related changes affected mental health for families. Adequate mental health resources for parents are crucial for supporting children and youth. Mental health consequences of the pandemic are significant and impact the healthcare system. Parents play a critical role in monitoring and addressing mental health difficulties in their families. Mental health literacy campaigns should involve children and youth and be tailored to their preferences. Healthcare professionals can promote mental health education in schools and communities. Virtual mental health support can improve access to care for marginalized youth. The article emphasizes the need for research, policy, and public health efforts to address disparities in mental health knowledge acquisition among children and youth, especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID’s economic, fiscal and health effects—a mixed bag for Canada
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: According to the article, Canada's public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively effective compared to other advanced economies. It had the fourth-lowest incidence rate and high vaccine uptake, but also implemented the third-highest level of restrictive measures. The economic impact, however, was significant, with Canada ranking 29th out of 40 advanced economies in per-capita GDP growth and experiencing the second-worst employment drop in the first year of the pandemic. Canada's fiscal response to the pandemic was also large, with a 19.7% increase in government spending in 2020, contributing to a negative fiscal balance. The federal government incurred most of this additional debt. While Canada's performance in controlling COVID-19 cases and vaccine uptake was favorable, it coincided with lower testing rates and higher crude mortality. In terms of economic impact, Canada underperformed in per-capita GDP growth and initial employment figures, though employment growth improved in 2021. Canada's inflation rate was influenced more by demand-side factors than supply-side issues. The country's fiscal response, largely driven by federal spending, was exceptionally large compared to other countries. Looking ahead, while Canada's fiscal management during the pandemic may reflect its long-term prudence, the significant deficit and fiscal response should not be sustained in the long term, especially with rising interest rates. This could limit the government's flexibility to respond to future crises. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, key factors to consider include vaccine uptake, crude mortality rates, and the potential impact of any new variants. With a high vaccine uptake, the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization is likely to decrease. However, the crude mortality rate provides insight into the case fatality rate, which could influence the strain on healthcare resources. Additionally, the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility or severity could impact hospitalization rates.

Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global labor markets, livelihoods, and workplace risks, with women bearing the brunt of layoffs and loss of livelihoods. To address this, the Women RISE initiative aims to fund action-oriented research that applies a gender-equality and health-equity lens to understand the relationships between women’s work and health in the context of COVID-19. The initiative is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and IDRC, and aligns with the United Nations Research Roadmap for the COVID-19 Recovery. The objectives of Women RISE are to fund research that addresses the impact of recent economic changes on women and identifies inclusive and gender-transformative recovery strategies. The scope of the research includes epidemiological studies, population health research, and intervention and implementation research related to women's health and work during COVID-19. The focus is on lowand middle-income countries (LMICs), with an emphasis on improving gender equality and health equity. The call for proposals will provide funding for 20 research teams, with a total amount of CAD20 million available. Research teams must be led by a LMIC-based researcher and include a co-lead from Canada and a relevant decision-maker. The anticipated timelines include a launch in March 2022, with deadlines for concept notes and full proposals in April and July, respectively. The funding start date is expected to be in Fall 2022. Here are some important facts from the article that could be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: COVID-19 has disrupted infectious disease prevention, immunization programs, and care services, which may impact hospitalizations. The pandemic has disproportionately affected women, including those living with HIV/AIDS and those in occupations with an increased risk of acquiring infections. The research funded by this initiative aims to understand the relationship between women's work and health, including the impact of policies, practices, and strategies implemented during COVID-19. The focus on LMICs is important as these countries may have different healthcare infrastructure and resources compared to high-income countries, which could impact hospitalization rates. The research will also explore how the COVID-19 experience can inform and improve responses to future health emergencies, including pandemics and large-scale acute events, which could help forecast and plan for hospitalization needs.

Title: J&J Covid-19 vaccine no longer available in the US
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available in the US as of last week, with providers instructed to dispose of any remaining doses. This limits the vaccine options in the US to the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. While about 19 million people in the US have received the J&J vaccine, there were about 12.5 million unused doses, indicating a significant number of people opted for the mRNA vaccines instead. The J&J vaccine's emergency use authorization was also limited due to the risk of a rare clotting condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). With the shift away from the J&J vaccine and the focus on mRNA vaccines, it is challenging to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately. However, the availability and continued uptake of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are expected to help manage COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

Title: Why we’ll keep finding meaning in the ‘Oedipus Rex’ plague drama far beyond COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the resurgence of interest in the ancient Greek tragedy "Oedipus Tyrannus" (Oedipus Rex/Oedipus the King) during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly its themes of plague and pandemic. The play, written by Sophocles and likely first produced in 429 BCE after an unknown disease swept through Athens, has been interpreted as a parallel to the modern-day pandemic. The article also mentions various productions and adaptations of "Oedipus" during and after the pandemic, including a Chicanx version, a star-studded zoom version dedicated to first responders, and a version produced at Berlin's Schaubühne theatre. The play's themes of pandemic and climate crisis, as well as its exploration of Oedipus' role as the origin of the plague, are highlighted by theatre critics and directors. The article also discusses a new edited volume that documents a Montreal-based theatre company's translations and productions of Greek tragedies, including "Oedipus Tyrannus," between 2010 and 2017. The volume explores the ancient themes of the plays and their reception in the current context, teasing out tensions between the ancient and modern interpretations. Finally, the article reflects on the enduring relevance of Sophocles' play, highlighting its ability to accommodate diverse and changing global anxieties and its focus on general truths rather than particular facts. The author concludes by reflecting on the impact of seeing "Oedipus" staged and the power of its tragic denouement, despite Aristotle's claim that the play is effective even without being seen.
