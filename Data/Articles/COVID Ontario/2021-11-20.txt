Here is a summary of the article: Health Canada has recently approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11, adding another important layer of protection against the virus. Dr. Michelle Barton-Forbes, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, addresses some common concerns that parents may have about the vaccine. Message to Hesitant Parents: Dr. Barton-Forbes reassures parents that mRNA vaccines like Pfizer have been extensively tested and administered to Canadians, with over 50 million doses given. While no medical procedure is entirely risk-free, Health Canada has determined that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. Current Impact of COVID-19 on Children: Currently, children make up 20% of new COVID-19 cases in Canada. While death and hospitalization are uncommon, there is a growing concern about the long-term effects of the virus on children, including long COVID, which can cause fatigue, insomnia, breathing difficulties, and mood changes. Vaccine Details: The vaccine for children is essentially the same as the one given to adults, but with a reduced dose of 10 micrograms, a third of the adult dose. This lower dose resulted in fewer side effects in the 5-11 age group compared to older adolescents and adults. Efficacy and Safety: The vaccine has been found to be 90.7% effective in children. Common side effects include soreness at the injection site, headaches, muscle aches, and mild fever, which typically disappear within two days. Importantly, there were no reports of myocarditis (heart inflammation) in the clinical trials for this age group, although this will continue to be monitored post-approval. Myocarditis Concerns: Myocarditis is a rare side effect that has been observed in adolescents and young adults after receiving an mRNA vaccine. However, affected individuals have recovered well without severe consequences. Scientists believe that the lower dose used in younger children, who are mostly pre-pubertal, may reduce the likelihood of myocarditis. Long-term Side Effects: In general, adverse effects from vaccines tend to appear within the first six weeks, and there is no reason to believe this vaccine will cause long-term side effects. The vaccine components are cleared from the body quickly. Children's Immune System Concerns: Parents should not worry about children's immune systems being unable to handle the vaccine. Children's immune systems routinely deal with multiple antigens, and the COVID-19 vaccine presents only one antigen. Natural Immunity vs. Vaccine: Natural immunity from a previous infection may wane over time and may not protect against new variants. Vaccination provides a safer and more reliable form of protection. Benefits vs. Risks: Health Canada has concluded that the benefits of vaccinating children aged five to 11 outweigh any known risks. No serious adverse events have been identified in this age group so far, but safety monitoring will continue post-approval to detect rare adverse events. This approval is a positive step forward in protecting children from COVID-19 and ensuring they can safely attend school and participate in extracurricular activities without disruptions caused by lockdowns or quarantines.

Title: An outbreak of COVID-19 associated with a fitness centre in Saskatchewan: Lessons for prevention, CCDR 47(11)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
From September 12 to October 20, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Saskatchewan, with 63 confirmed cases. The outbreak began with attendance at a local gym, which then seeded additional clusters in a high school, a hospital, and three workplaces. The majority of cases were adults aged 18-64 (79.4%), and males accounted for 54% of cases. Secondary cases primarily occurred among household contacts of gym-goers, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. The gym had an attack rate of approximately 11% among its members. Four infectious cases attended a regional high school but did not lead to any secondary infections, likely due to public health measures such as mandatory masking, small learning groups, and staggered breaks. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the unique lineage of cluster-related cases (SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.72). The outbreak investigation revealed that short-term closures and cleaning may not be enough to stop transmission in gyms, as members tend to attend regularly over time. To control the outbreak, public health authorities conducted case investigations, contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals, inspections, education, surveillance, and testing. The findings suggest that targeted preventive actions in gyms and similar settings may be necessary to prevent future outbreaks.

Title: COVID-19: Coughing without masks, distancing alone is not enough
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True

The article highlights a study that found physical distancing alone is not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19 indoors, and that mask-wearing is crucial to reducing the transmission of airborne particles. When people are unmasked, more than 70% of airborne particles can travel beyond two metres in 30 seconds, while less than 1% of particles cross this threshold when masks are worn. The study used a computer program to simulate coughing dynamics in indoor spaces, taking into account factors such as ventilation, posture, age, and gender. The results suggest that mask mandates and good ventilation are critical to curbing the spread of COVID-19, especially during the flu season and winter months when people tend to gather indoors more often. This research can inform public health guidelines and help policymakers make evidence-based decisions to protect public health.

Title: COVID-19 accelerated many changes impacting rural communities — we need to support their resilience
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural communities in Canada and highlights the importance of supporting rural resilience. Here are the key points: Rural Canada is vital for the country's socio-economic well-being, including food production, energy generation, and employment. The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing inequities in these areas. The 2021 State of Rural Canada Report, co-edited by the authors, provides a snapshot of rural issues and highlights opportunities for recovery and resilience. Rural communities are facing unprecedented challenges, including demographic shifts, economic changes, and the impacts of climate change, made worse by weak rural development policies. Examples of resilience include Nova Scotia's shift to online farmers' markets and Labrador's food and heat voucher programs. Supporting rural resilience requires investments in rural policy and development, recognizing the diversity of rural communities, and applying a rural lens to government practices. Recommendations include enhancing regional collaboration, taking action on truth and reconciliation, and planning for sustainable rural futures. The pandemic has brought to light the issues faced by rural Canadians, and all citizens must work towards ensuring the sustainability and resilience of these communities. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in rural Canada, it is important to consider the unique challenges these communities face, such as limited healthcare resources and remote locations. Factors that could influence hospitalization rates include the availability of intensive care beds and ventilators, the distance to healthcare facilities, the age and health of the population, and the impact of vaccine uptake. Forecasting models should also take into account the potential for outbreaks in rural settings, as limited healthcare capacity can be quickly overwhelmed. Proactive planning and investment in rural healthcare infrastructure and services are crucial to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and improve overall community resilience.

Title: Labour market impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous people living off reserve in the provinces: March 2020 to August 2021
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health and socio-economic conditions of First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and non-Indigenous populations in Canada. Restrictions imposed by provinces and territories have resulted in precarious work situations and slowed labor market recovery, especially for Indigenous people, women, and young adults. Indigenous people face additional challenges due to their younger average age, lower-paying jobs, and casual or temporary employment, which have been heavily impacted by the pandemic. The article uses data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to examine the labor market impacts of the pandemic on Indigenous people in the 18 months following its start. Employment recovery among Indigenous people was initially slow but recently surpassed pre-pandemic levels, reducing the gap with non-Indigenous people. As of August 2021, the employment rate among Indigenous people was 57.7%, compared to 56.2% pre-pandemic, while for non-Indigenous people, it was 61.2%. The unemployment rate among Indigenous people has decreased since its peak in May 2020 but remains above the pre-pandemic level at 11.6%. Indigenous labor force participation surpassed pre-pandemic levels 15 months into the pandemic, while non-Indigenous participation recovered within six months. Older Indigenous workers continue to face negative impacts, with a participation rate 2.6 points below pre-pandemic levels, possibly due to early retirement to avoid health risks. Employment recovery has been slower for First Nations people living off-reserve, with an unemployment rate of 15.0% as of August 2021, compared to 8.4% for Métis. Indigenous women have faced persistent negative impacts, with an unemployment rate of 11.9% as of August 2021, while Indigenous men's employment has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. This article provides insights into the labor market impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indigenous people in Canada, highlighting the slower recovery and ongoing challenges faced by specific groups within the Indigenous community. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors could be considered: Infection rates within the Indigenous community and the general population. The effectiveness of public health measures, including vaccination rates and adherence to restrictions. The capacity of healthcare systems to handle COVID-19 cases, including ICU bed availability and staffing levels. The presence of underlying health conditions and access to healthcare services within the Indigenous community. The social and economic factors that may impact the risk of infection and severity of illness, such as housing conditions and access to resources.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has begun a large-long-term study to track the impacts of COVID-19 on children. The study will follow up to 1,000 children and young adults who previously tested positive for COVID-19, aiming to understand the long-term physical and mental health effects of the disease in this age group. This study is particularly important given the significant acute and long-term effects of COVID-19 that have been observed in some children, as well as the vulnerability of this age group due to their ineligibility for vaccination. The study will also look at the long-term immune responses to the disease, screen for genetic factors that may influence outcomes, and assess whether immunological factors impact long-term health. The study is expected to provide valuable insights into the overall health and development of children following COVID-19 infection and may help to identify risk factors for complications. This research is part of the NIH's RECOVER initiative to understand the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and is anticipated to take approximately six years to complete.

Wildlife experts in Canada are monitoring deer populations after a U.S. study found that nearly 40% of white-tailed deer had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. While Canadian testing on wildlife, including deer, has shown no evidence of the virus so far, the findings from the U.S. study have raised concerns. Establishing a wildlife reservoir for the virus could lead to reinfection in humans and potential mutations that escape vaccine protection. Several mammal species, including weasels, cats, beavers, and mice, are susceptible to the virus. Mink farms in British Columbia have experienced infections, and Quebec is also testing deer populations. Hunters are advised to take precautions when handling carcasses, such as wearing gloves and ensuring meat is well-cooked. With white-tailed deer present in urban parks, people are also advised to wear masks when near these animals. These measures aim to prevent potential infection and the spread of COVID-19 from wildlife to humans.
