Title: COVID-19 in people with rheumatic diseases: risks, outcomes, treatment considerations
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines as one of modern medical science's greatest achievements. It mentions six widely used vaccines and their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The article also addresses waning immunity and the need for additional vaccine doses. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article provides insights into vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe illness and breakthrough infections. It mentions that vaccine effectiveness for avoiding hospitalization was lower in immunosuppressed individuals (62.9%) compared to immunocompetent individuals (91.3%). Immunosuppressed individuals represented a significant proportion of hospitalized breakthrough infections in studies from Israel and the USA. These findings suggest that immunosuppression increases the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19, and this information can be valuable in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially among vulnerable populations.

Title: Medicago's homegrown, plant-based COVID-19 vaccine approved by Health Canada
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Health Canada has approved Medicago's plant-based COVID-19 vaccine, providing Canadians with a new option for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This is the sixth vaccine approved in Canada and is notable for being the first plant-based vaccine for human use. The vaccine has shown high efficacy rates, with an overall efficacy rate of 71% against all variants and a higher rate of 75% against the Delta variant. Health Canada has placed conditions on the authorization, requiring Medicago to continue providing data on the vaccine's safety and efficacy, including protection against new variants. The vaccine, called "Covifenz," is a two-dose shot that uses plant-derived virus-like particles that resemble the coronavirus but don't contain its genetic material. The approval is currently for adults aged 18 to 64, as there was limited data for older adults in the clinical trials due to high vaccination rates in that age group. Medicago is working on gathering more data to seek authorization for older adults. The vaccine's approval adds to Canada's vaccine supply, with the government purchasing 20 million doses and an option for 56 million more. This vaccine may not significantly impact Canada's overall vaccination rate, as most Canadians have already received two or more doses, but it provides an alternative for those who prefer a non-mRNA vaccine. The plant-based technology used by Medicago is promising for future vaccine development and could be a unique way to produce and scale vaccination efforts.

Title: COVID-19 vaccination clinics at the Glen site and at the Montreal General Hospital will close
Publisher: McGill University Health Centre
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The MUHC vaccination clinics in Montreal, which administered over 205,000 COVID-19 vaccines, will be closing on February 27, 2022, due to a significant decrease in bookings over the past three weeks. The decrease in bookings and the closure of these clinics could indicate a potential decline in COVID-19 hospitalizations in the region, as vaccinations help prevent severe illness and reduce the strain on healthcare resources. However, it's important to continue monitoring the situation and adhere to public health measures to ensure a sustained decrease in hospitalizations and the effective management of the pandemic.

Title: People from racial, ethnic, and other groups report frequent COVID-19–related discrimination
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses a study led by Paula D. Strassle, Ph.D., from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, which highlights the prevalence of COVID-19-related discrimination among various racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that people from marginalized groups, including those with limited English proficiency and lower education levels, reported experiencing more discrimination related to COVID-19 compared to white adults. The study surveyed 5,500 adults from different racial and ethnic backgrounds and found that 22.1% of participants had experienced COVID-19-related discriminatory behaviors, with 42.7% reporting that people acted afraid of them. Participants from Asian or American Indian/Alaska Native backgrounds were most likely to experience discrimination, followed by Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and Latino participants. The study also noted higher rates of discrimination in big cities and certain states. The findings suggest that the pandemic has exacerbated existing biases against racial and ethnic minorities and other marginalized populations. The study underscores the importance of addressing discrimination through responsible public health messaging during crises. The study acknowledges limitations such as online survey administration and self-reported data. The study emphasizes the need for public health messaging strategies that combat biases against marginalized groups and promote inclusivity during public health crises.

The article "Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid): What Prescribers and Pharmacists Need to Know" by the Ontario COVID-19 Drugs and Biologics Clinical Practice Guidelines Working Group provides information and guidelines for healthcare professionals regarding the use of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) in the treatment of COVID-19. Here is a summary of the article: Purpose: The article aims to provide prescribers and pharmacists with the latest information and guidelines on the use of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients. Key Points: Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) is a combination of two antiviral drugs that can reduce the risk of hospitalization and severe illness from COVID-19. It is authorized for use within 5 days of symptom onset in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. Prescribers should assess patient eligibility and potential benefits and risks, especially drug interactions and adverse effects. Pharmacists play a crucial role in verifying prescriptions, educating patients about the medication, and monitoring and reporting any adverse events. The article provides detailed information on dosage, administration, storage, and handling of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid). It also includes eligibility criteria and considerations for special populations, such as pediatric patients, elderly individuals, and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: While the article does not directly provide forecasts or models for COVID-19 hospitalizations, the widespread and proper use of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) in high-risk patients is expected to reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations. By preventing severe illness and the need for hospitalization in eligible patients, this treatment option can help alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. This article offers important insights and guidelines for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding the use of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) in the ongoing management and treatment of COVID-19.

Title: Myocarditis Risk Associated with COVID-19 Infection
Publisher: Beaumont Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, can be caused by various factors, including bacterial and parasitic infections, and even certain drugs. While most cases resolve without treatment, it can lead to dangerous symptoms such as an irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The condition is typically diagnosed through various tests, including X-rays, ECGs, and blood work, and treated with anti-inflammatory medications and heart/blood pressure medications. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, myocarditis affected a small portion of the population, mostly active and healthy young men. However, since the pandemic began, rates have skyrocketed, with approximately 146 cases per 100,000 people, according to the CDC. COVID-19 infections have been linked to a higher risk of myocarditis and lasting heart damage. While rare, myocarditis can also occur following COVID-19 vaccination, but the chances are extremely low (approximately 1 in 100,000 vaccines administered). In almost all cases, myocarditis related to the vaccine is mild and resolves quickly without lasting effects, especially in children. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations related to myocarditis, it is important to consider the high risk associated with COVID-19 infection. The significantly increased risk of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients could lead to a higher number of hospitalizations, especially in men, older adults, and children, who are at the highest risk for developing the condition. Therefore, while vaccination may cause a very small number of myocarditis cases, the benefits of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations far outweigh the risks.

Title: Immigrant labour market outcomes during recessions: Comparing the early 1990s, late 2000s and COVID-19 recessions
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article examines the impact of recessions on the labor market outcomes of recent immigrants in Canada, specifically during the early 1990s, 2008/2009, and COVID-19 recessions. It finds that: The early 1990s recession had a more severe and prolonged impact on recent immigrants' employment and earnings compared to Canadian-born individuals, while the 2008/2009 recession had a relatively minor differential effect. The COVID-19 recession disproportionately affected low-wage workers, the less educated, and young women, including recently immigrated women who experienced higher unemployment rates than Canadian-born women. The industries hardest hit during the COVID-19 recession were accommodation, food services, and retail trade, while the previous two recessions primarily affected the goods-producing sector. Recent immigrants entering Canada during the early 1990s recession experienced persistent earnings gaps compared to those entering before the recession, suggesting possible "scarring" effects. However, no conclusive evidence of scarring was found for the 2008/2009 recession. The selection of immigrants from the temporary foreign worker pool, which has increased since the early 2010s, may have contributed to their varying levels of economic establishment and resilience during recessions. The article highlights the differential impacts of recessions on recent immigrants and provides insights into the short-term and potential long-term effects on their labor market outcomes.

Title: ‘I am back to square one’: How COVID-19 impacted recently resettled Yazidi and Syrian refugees
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugees in Canada, focusing on the emotional, social, and economic challenges they have faced. The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and vulnerable populations, including refugees, have been disproportionately affected. Many refugee families experienced job losses, disruptions to schooling, and increased expenses during the pandemic, leading to a sense of hopelessness and feeling unsettled. Lockdowns and social isolation also took a toll on mental health, particularly for those living in crowded housing conditions with minimal access to green space. The restrictions triggered memories of pre-migration trauma for many refugees, causing increased mental health challenges. However, the refugees expressed gratitude for the sense of security and sanctuary they felt in Canada, believing that living in the country protected them from the extreme effects of the pandemic in their countries of origin. The article also highlights the resilience of refugee communities and the importance of community-led approaches in supporting them during and after the pandemic. The Land of Dreams urban farming project, for example, provided a space for Yazidi women to build new relationships, connect with nature, and share their cultural knowledge. Overall, the pandemic has revealed the need for governments to address the disproportionate burden placed on refugees and other marginalized groups and to include them in the formulation of policies that will help them recover and catch up in areas such as language acquisition, employment, and housing.
