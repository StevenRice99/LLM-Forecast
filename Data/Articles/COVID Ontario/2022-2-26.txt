This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19-related hospitalizations are trending downward in Ontario. Gathering restrictions have been loosened, allowing up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. A Toronto epidemiologist, Dr. Fahad Razak, cautions that risk levels are still reasonably high across communities, and testing breakdowns limit the ability to test everyone with symptoms. Razak recommends taking precautions such as opening windows, using fans, reducing contacts before visiting vulnerable individuals, wearing masks, and using rapid tests. He also emphasizes the importance of monitoring for symptoms, even if testing negative, and staying home if experiencing flu-like illness, fever, shortness of breath, or cough. These points suggest that while hospitalizations are decreasing, there is still a need for caution and precautions to prevent further spread, particularly among vulnerable populations. This information can inform forecasting models by highlighting the ongoing risks and the importance of continued public health measures to mitigate them.
