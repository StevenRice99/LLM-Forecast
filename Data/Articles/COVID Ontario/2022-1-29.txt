Trusted: False

Key values:
The Omicron variant has likely infected more people in 5 weeks than all of the rest of the pandemic combined.
Even a milder severity of the virus will translate into a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths due to the high numbers of infections.
Vaccination remains effective against severe health outcomes, with three doses showing 95% effectiveness in preventing hospitalization or death from Omicron.
The official count of COVID-19 deaths may underestimate the true toll, as not all deaths are reported if they do not have a positive test result.

The article highlights several key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Record-high hospitalizations have just begun to show signs of peaking, but experts warn against premature reopening.
The Omicron variant's subvariant BA.2 is spreading rapidly and may be 1.5 times more infectious than the original Omicron variant.
Experts recommend a cautious approach to reopening to avoid falling into the same traps as previous waves.
Leading indicators like wastewater surveillance, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths should be monitored alongside lagging indicators like PCR testing.
High population immunity from vaccines and infections may protect against future waves, but it's unclear how long immunity lasts or if it will protect against future variants.
