This article provides guidance on using behavioral science principles to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Ontario, Canada. HCWs are a key priority group for vaccination, and effective communication strategies are crucial to address their concerns and encourage vaccination. The article summarizes nine principles to support vaccine confidence and uptake. Here is a summary of the key points: Tailoring: Customize messages and approaches to address specific barriers and enablers to vaccination among HCWs, considering factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, work location, and profession. Distinguish messenger, channel, and message: Choose trusted messengers such as hospitals, unions, and health professionals who share similar backgrounds with the target HCW population. Use multiple channels and formats to deliver consistent messaging. Beyond information/education: Recognize that vaccination decisions are influenced by various factors beyond just information and education. Address concerns about vaccine side effects and emphasize the greater risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the low risk of vaccine side effects. Understand and validate emotions: Normalize feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, and provide actions to address these emotions, such as promoting vaccine safety and its role in protecting loved ones. Build positive social norms: Identify peers or colleagues with similar experiences who have decided to get vaccinated and showcase their decisions. Provide data on HCW vaccination rates and highlight increases over time. Support motivated HCWs: Establish a central registry for proactive registration and provide regular updates on vaccine eligibility and timing. Make it easy to get vaccinated: Communicate practical information clearly, including location, eligibility, defaults, appointment scheduling, reminders, and financial supports. Address intention-action gap: Help HCWs create concrete plans for vaccination by providing options for location and timing, and encourage them to record their implementation intentions. Leverage behavioral science: Organizations involved in communication and vaccination logistics can apply these principles to develop effective campaigns that consider vaccination decision-making, behavior, and underlying beliefs. By following these principles, organizations can effectively address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine confidence and uptake among HCWs, contributing to a stronger pandemic response in Ontario.

The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) COVID-19 Data Tracker now provides Calgarians with real-time data on SARS-CoV-2 levels in Calgary's wastewater. This data is collected by a team from various institutions, including the Cumming School of Medicine (CSM) and is accessible through an interactive map on the CHI website. The data reveals that high traces of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater precede an increase in clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases, offering an early warning system for outbreaks. The City of Calgary has supported this initiative, recognizing its potential to protect public health. The tracker also provides insights into case transmission sources, with unknown sources accounting for around 35% in recent weeks. The CHI plans to introduce more detailed data for specific areas within Calgary in the coming weeks, enhancing the tool's ability to identify outbreak locations and inform reopening decisions. Location-specific sampling is also in development, further improving the accuracy of COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and community safety.

Title: The hidden long-term cognitive effects of COVID-19
Publisher: Harvard Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the brain and how it can affect cognitive function, including concentration and memory. The virus can enter the brain through the nose, affecting the brain's blood vessels and causing inflammation and cognitive issues. People with severe COVID-19 cases are more likely to experience these issues, but even mild cases can result in cognitive problems. Long COVID, or prolonged symptoms months after infection, may also involve brain-related symptoms. The article also mentions the study that found that 81% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experienced some form of cognitive dysfunction, most commonly confusion and altered consciousness. Additionally, the article highlights the higher risk of cognitive issues in older COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing neurological conditions. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article suggests that understanding the neurological effects of the virus is crucial. The impact on cognitive function can affect a person's ability to perform daily tasks and may require rehabilitation services. Additionally, the article emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand the long-term brain-related consequences of COVID-19. In terms of important forecasting factors, the article suggests that the incidence of cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients could result in a higher demand for hospital resources, including neurological and rehabilitation services. The potential long-term effects on the brain may also lead to an increased need for outpatient care and rehabilitation services, impacting healthcare systems. Additionally, the higher risk of cognitive issues in older adults and those with neurological conditions may contribute to hospitalization rates.

Publisher: Alberta Health Services
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Alberta Precision Laboratories (APL) has been at the forefront of tracking and understanding the evolution of the COVID-19 virus in Alberta, Canada, since the beginning of the pandemic. APL's team of lab scientists and technologists, including Sandy Shokoples and Kanti Pabbaraju, have been crucial in detecting and monitoring variants of concern. On December 24, Shokoples discovered Alberta's first case of the U.K. variant, which sparked an "all-hands-on-deck" situation as the team worked tirelessly to test all positive COVID-19 samples for mutations. This proactive approach has provided valuable data for health authorities and policymakers in their efforts to slow the spread of the virus and prepare for potential future waves. APL has developed its own tests to screen for variants of concern, and they have screened over 7,000 COVID-19 positive samples, as well as conducting full genome sequencing on hundreds of selected samples weekly. This ongoing surveillance of the virus's genetic code is vital for identifying and tracking variations that may impact the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in the community. The work of APL's lab team has been instrumental in Alberta's response to the pandemic and has helped inform public health measures to protect the population.
