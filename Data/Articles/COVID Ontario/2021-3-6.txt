The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: The Ontario government plans to start Phase 2 of its COVID-19 vaccination plan in April, which will focus on age and at-risk groups. About 9 million Ontario residents are expected to receive their first dose of a vaccine in this phase, which is expected to be complete by at least July. The vaccination plan prioritizes adults between 60 and 79 years old, people in high-risk congregate settings, individuals with high-risk chronic conditions and their caregivers, and people who cannot work from home. The government has expanded the list of individuals eligible for the vaccine in Phase 2 to include more at-risk groups and COVID-19 hot spots. Officials expect that the adjustments will prevent deaths, hospitalizations, and admissions to intensive care units. The vaccination plan also includes a focus on hot spots with high rates of death, hospitalizations, and transmission, with some public health units receiving up to 920,000 doses of the vaccine. The province has administered over 820,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine so far, with more than 260,000 Ontarians fully immunized. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has recommended extending the interval for the second dose to about four months, which Ontario officials will implement as of March 10. The province is expecting a steady flow of vaccines, with confidence that the flow will continue uninterrupted. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide information on the vaccination plan, the number of people expected to be vaccinated, and the focus on at-risk groups and hot spots. This information can be used to estimate the potential impact of the vaccination plan on hospitalizations and ICU admissions.
