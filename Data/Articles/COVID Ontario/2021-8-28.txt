Title: What is functional neurological disorder and is it connected to COVID-19 vaccines? Experts explain
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses how unverified videos of people experiencing Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) symptoms after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are being spread online, often with misinformation about the vaccine's safety. Experts warn that these videos can fuel vaccine hesitancy and mislead people into believing that the vaccine is causing neurological problems.
The article highlights two cases: one of a woman who experienced FND symptoms after receiving the vaccine, and another case where a patient suffered from dissociation due to anxiety around the vaccination process. The experts stress that FND is a real condition, but not directly caused by vaccines, and that its symptoms can be triggered by stress.
Dr. Michael Fasano, a neurologist, emphasized that FND cases are often misdiagnosed or misunderstood, leading to patients feeling ashamed or embarrassed about their condition. He noted that a lack of awareness among doctors and the public can contribute to vaccine hesitancy and the spread of misinformation.
The article also notes that the pandemic has created an "infodemic" with an overwhelming amount of information, making it difficult for people to distinguish between true and false claims. Experts hope that increased awareness about FND and its causes will help both patients and clinicians better understand the condition and make early diagnosis easier, leading to more effective treatment.
