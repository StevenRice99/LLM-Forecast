TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the challenges in vaccinating Black communities in Toronto, which could lead to a higher proportion of Black patients hospitalized or seriously ill with COVID-19. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: Low vaccination rates in some neighborhoods with high Black populations, with less than half of adults fully immunized. Black residents make up 20-30% of the population in under-vaccinated postal codes and are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19, especially the delta variant. The lack of vaccinations could result in a higher proportion of Black patients hospitalized or seriously ill with COVID-19. Community outreach and mobile clinics have shown positive results in increasing vaccination rates, but more efforts are needed to reach the vaccine-hesitant and resistant populations. These factors could contribute to an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, particularly among Black communities, if vaccination rates do not improve.
