Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is primarily transmitted through close contact between individuals less than 2 meters apart for more than 15 minutes. Transmission occurs via aerosols, direct contact, or contaminated surfaces. The risk of transmission is higher in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces with prolonged exposure. The maximum infection distance is unclear but likely limited to a few meters. While there is no direct evidence of airborne transmission over long distances, the risk increases indoors with poor ventilation, crowding, and prolonged exposure. The viability of the virus is favored at 4°C and 20-40% relative humidity, and it can survive in the air and on surfaces for varying durations. To limit transmission, a combination of preventive measures is necessary, including limiting contacts, physical distancing, respiratory and hand hygiene, adequate indoor ventilation, mask-wearing, and cleaning. Proper ventilation and filtration systems can help reduce the concentration of viral particles indoors. Natural ventilation by opening windows or doors can also be effective, but its efficiency depends on various factors. Recommendations for aeration and ventilation in indoor public spaces emphasize the importance of proper ventilation to protect workers and occupants. In settings with outdated heating and ventilation systems, compliance with barrier measures and individual protection is crucial. Ventilation specialists should be involved to optimize existing systems to meet the required standards. To protect healthcare workers, it is crucial to respect all preventive measures, ensure proper ventilation, and wear N95 respirators in high-risk situations or during uncontrolled outbreaks. The Comité sur les infections nosocomiales du Québec (CINQ) continues to adapt its recommendations for personal protective equipment based on evolving scientific knowledge.

Title: The Role of Wastewater Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the challenges of surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission by symptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, which can lead to missed or delayed case detection. To address this, wastewater testing has been proposed as a complementary method for early detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Current applications of wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-2 include early detection of outbreaks and surges, population-wide surveillance, specific population surveillance (e.g. in high-risk residential settings), and surveillance of Variants of Concern (VOCs). Wastewater testing has been shown to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in advance of clinical confirmation of COVID-19 cases, as evidenced by studies in Northern Italy and the Netherlands. Wastewater testing can also be used for population-wide surveillance, with dashboards displaying wastewater test results alongside clinical data to inform the public about surges in cases. Specific population surveillance in high-risk settings, such as long-term care homes and correctional facilities, can help identify asymptomatic cases and prevent further transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health organizations have identified areas for improvement to ensure the reliability and accuracy of wastewater testing. These include analytical methods, reporting, interpretation of tests, and program sustainability. Factors that can affect test results include variations between individuals, differences in wastewater infrastructure, and variations in sample collection and measurement methods. Overall, wastewater testing has the potential to provide early warning signs of COVID-19 outbreaks and surges, helping public health authorities make informed decisions about interventions and mitigation strategies. However, further development and standardization of analytical methods are needed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of wastewater testing data.

Title: Association between obesity and hospital mortality in critical COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The study found a significant association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients, indicating that obese patients are at higher risk of dying from the disease. This is the first Canadian study to investigate the impact of obesity on COVID-19 hospitalizations using BMI as a continuous variable. The findings are consistent with previous research and suggest that obese patients may have been sicker or received more aggressive treatment. The study also reported a higher prevalence of obesity among critical COVID-19 patients compared to the general Canadian population, indicating that obesity may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. The study has some limitations, including a small sample size and a lack of data on ventilator settings and lung physiology. However, the use of BMI as a continuous variable increases the statistical power of the results. The findings suggest that BMI could be a useful tool for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and that obese individuals may require more intensive treatment and monitoring to improve their chances of survival.

Title: Trends in household non-mortgage loans: The evolution of Canadian household debt before and during COVID-19
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household non-mortgage debt in Canada and provides insights into debt accumulation patterns during the pandemic. The article also explores the relationship between household disposable income, government support, and spending habits during this period. Household non-mortgage debt in Canada has grown steadily since the mid-1990s due to declining interest rates and easier access to credit. The pandemic caused a shift in household spending habits, with a focus on essential goods and services, leading to a decline in non-mortgage debt accumulation. Government support measures, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), helped bolster disposable incomes, despite a contraction in labour incomes. Household disposable income reached record levels, and labour incomes rebounded as restrictions eased, surpassing pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of 2021. Retail sales and household consumption expenditures declined sharply during the initial lockdown but partially recovered as restrictions eased. The article includes data tables and charts to illustrate the trends in household non-mortgage debt, disposable income, and spending habits during the pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, important facts to consider include: The impact of government support measures on household disposable income and spending habits. An increase in disposable income may lead to higher non-essential spending, which could contribute to hospitalizations if public health measures are relaxed. The effectiveness of public health measures, such as lockdowns and social distancing, in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and their impact on household spending and debt accumulation. The rate of labour market recovery and its influence on household incomes and spending patterns. A faster recovery may result in increased economic activity and potentially higher hospitalizations if public health measures are not adhered to. The vaccination rate and the emergence of new COVID-19 variants can significantly impact hospitalization forecasts. Higher vaccination rates may reduce the severity of the disease and hospitalizations, while new variants may have different transmission rates and disease outcomes. Overall, the article provides insights into the financial behaviour of Canadian households during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the interplay between disposable income, government support, and spending habits. These factors can be considered when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as they may influence the spread of the virus and the demand for healthcare resources.
