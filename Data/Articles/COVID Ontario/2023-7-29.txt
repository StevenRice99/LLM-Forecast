A new antibody for RSV has been approved, which may help protect infants against RSV this winter. Overall, the article suggests that while COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are currently low, it is still important to take preventative measures such as getting vaccinated to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: In Halton, new cases and hospitalizations have increased for the second week in a row, reversing the downward trend seen in May and June. One person died in Burlington, connected to a new outbreak at a retirement home, breaking the region's six-week streak without any COVID-19-related deaths. Only 6% of Halton residents have a full series of immunization, and among those 50 and under, only 2.5% are fully immunized. Ontario is no longer providing regular updates on COVID-19 data, but as of April 15, 2023, there were 1.60 million cases, 16,404 deaths, and 812 people in hospital with COVID-19. Canada has had 4.57 million cumulative cases of COVID-19, with 566,900 active cases and 2,353 people currently in hospital. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may be increasing, particularly in the Halton region, and that vaccination rates are low, which could contribute to future increases in hospitalizations.
