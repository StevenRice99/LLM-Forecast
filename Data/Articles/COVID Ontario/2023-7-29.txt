Title: What's the future of wastewater testing for COVID-19?
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article emphasizes the importance of wastewater surveillance as a valuable tool for early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 outbreaks in communities. Here are the key points and facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Wastewater surveillance has been an important tool for detecting COVID-19 outbreaks and is still used to search for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. Funding for wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 beyond 2023 is uncertain, and experts are calling for a standardized federal system to replace the current patchwork approach. As of the latest update by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 41% of wastewater monitoring sites showed decreasing COVID-19 levels, while 28% showed an increase. COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU patients in Canada are declining, but Dr. Isaac Bogoch warns that most parameters will likely rise again in the fall. Wastewater surveillance is a valuable early detection tool as it doesn't rely on individual testing and reporting. However, the number of tests has decreased as the severity of cases has waned, and some jurisdictions have ended or scaled down pilot projects. Ontario, for example, has reduced its testing sites from 170 to 70, and Quebec now has only four sites. A federal strategy and a standardized system for wastewater monitoring are needed, as current programs are independent and lack data linkage. The reduction in testing may reflect complacency after three years of effective vigilance, which has provided valuable data for public health decision-making. The pandemic prompted experts in various fields to pivot and collaborate on wastewater testing, demonstrating the power of interdisciplinary cooperation. Wastewater testing has highlighted health equity issues, as it can provide insights into the health of vulnerable and underserved communities, including shelters, long-term care facilities, and remote Indigenous communities. Wastewater surveillance offers a simple and equitable way to measure disease burden, as it counts everyone who uses the bathroom, regardless of their access to healthcare or testing infrastructure.

Title: Inquiry must assess how Canada’s fragmented COVID-19 response lost the public’s trust
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False

Canada has had lower COVID-19 cases and deaths than other G10 countries and higher vaccination rates, but these numbers hide inequities and challenges in data sharing and public trust. The fragmented decision-making process between federal and provincial/territorial governments led to varying public health measures and a lack of transparency, resulting in a loss of confidence in public health guidance. Outdated data infrastructure and legal and cultural problems, such as data privacy laws and a risk-averse culture, hindered real-time public health decision-making. The lack of nuanced data and the failure to address socio-economic and structural inequities contributed to a loss of public trust. Health inequities were highest among racialized communities, recent immigrants, lower-wage essential workers, and those living in high-density, multigenerational households. To prepare for future public health emergencies and restore public trust, Canada needs an independent public inquiry that includes diverse voices and has a mandate to implement change, with a focus on reforming data generation, access, and use.

Title: COVID-19 is linked to changes in the time–space dimension of human mobility
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article examines the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on human mobility patterns in the United Kingdom using location-based services (LBS) data. The analysis focuses on the spatial and temporal dimensions of mobility, including the radius of gyration and mobility synchronization. The results show that the lockdowns had a significant impact on reducing human mobility, with the second lockdown resulting in the most considerable decrease in synchronicity levels. There were also differences in mobility patterns between urban and rural areas, with rural areas showing a greater radius of gyration. The correlation between the spatial dimension of mobility and unemployment rate remained positive during the pandemic, while the correlation between the temporal dimension and unemployment rate became negative. The article also explores the relationship between mobility patterns and occupation types, finding that areas with a higher concentration of managerial occupations tend to have larger radii of gyration and higher mobility synchronization. Overall, the article provides insights into how human mobility patterns were affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns and how these patterns vary across different demographic and economic factors.

Title: Recovery of Canada’s Labour Market After the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Toronto Metropolitan University
Trusted: False

The article discusses the trend in job postings during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on the year 2022. Here is a summary, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: There was an initial sharp decline in job postings in 2020 due to the onset of the pandemic. However, job postings have been on an upward trend since 2021, with a 60% increase in 2022 compared to 2021. The number of job postings in 2022 was 52% higher than in 2019, pre-pandemic. The increase in job postings in 2022 may be due to businesses struggling to fill vacancies during the worker shortage caused by the pandemic and high employee absenteeism due to the Omicron variant, influenza, and other respiratory viruses. According to Statistics Canada, 8.1% of employees were absent due to sickness or disability in early December 2022, higher than the monthly average from 2017-2019 (6.9%). The increase in job postings could be an important indicator of economic recovery and changing labor market demands post-pandemic. Additionally, the high rate of absenteeism due to sickness or disability could be a factor in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. A higher rate of absenteeism may indicate a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infections, which could lead to an increase in hospitalizations, especially if a more severe variant emerges or if there are co-infections with other respiratory viruses.

Title: Will a COVID-19 Vaccine Throw Your Period Off?
Publisher: Health Essentials
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: COVID-19 Vaccines and Menstrual Changes: What to Know Summary: There is evolving evidence of a link between COVID-19 vaccines and menstrual changes, with several studies showing an association. A survey found that 42% of 16,000 respondents experienced heavier menstrual bleeding after vaccination, but the PRESTO study in 2023 found no significant relationship. Current research suggests a small increase (about one day) in the length of the first menstrual cycle after vaccination, but these changes are observational and not cause for concern. The immune system and uterus connection can explain these changes, as the immune system ramps up before ovulation and hormonal changes affect uterine immune cells. Vaccine-related period changes are expected to be minor and short-term, and COVID-19 vaccinations remain safe and effective. This article provides insights into potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines related to menstrual changes. While the evidence is still evolving, the current understanding is that any vaccine-related menstrual alterations are minor and temporary. This information can be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it reassures vaccine safety and effectiveness, addressing potential concerns about side effects.

Title: The changing nature of work since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True

Here is a summary of the article: The article examines how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the nature of work and occupational trends in Canada. It updates previous research by including data from the pandemic period up to 2022. The analysis focuses on four broad occupation types: managerial, professional, and technical occupations (non-routine, cognitive tasks); service occupations (non-routine, manual tasks); sales, clerical, and administrative support (routine, cognitive tasks); and production, craft, repair, and operative occupations (routine, manual tasks). During the pandemic, the share of employed individuals in managerial, professional, and technical occupations increased faster than in the three decades before the pandemic. This acceleration accounted for 30.1% of the growth in these occupations over the past 35 years. The increase was accompanied by declines in service and production occupations, particularly for men. The changes were more pronounced among younger workers (25-34 years) compared to older workers (45-54 years). The pandemic may have accelerated these trends due to economic and health concerns on the worker side and efforts by businesses to make their operations more resilient on the employer side. Government supports were available to help displaced workers retrain if needed. The industry distribution of employment may also have influenced changes in the nature of work during the pandemic. The article concludes that the pandemic may have accelerated long-term trends in the nature of work, with important implications for workers, firms, and policymakers. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts may be relevant: The pandemic accelerated the shift towards non-routine, cognitive tasks, with a significant increase in managerial, professional, and technical occupations. Declines were observed in service and production occupations, particularly for men. Younger workers experienced more pronounced changes in occupation types compared to older workers. Government supports were available for retraining displaced workers. Industry distribution of employment may have influenced the nature of work during the pandemic. The pandemic created economic and health concerns for workers and employers, potentially driving these changes. These trends and their potential impact on hospitalization forecasts should be considered when making predictions about COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Public health experts excoriate Canada Covid response and call for inquiry
Publisher: The Guardian
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Public health experts are calling for an inquiry into Canada's COVID-19 response, arguing that a lack of proper data collection and sharing hid issues and inequalities that could have been addressed early on to save lives. Income and racial inequality, for instance, influenced COVID outcomes, with Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths in Ontario being three times higher in the lowest-income neighborhoods. The authors argue that Canada needs to reform privacy legislation to facilitate health data sharing and build a data governance program to better prepare for future pandemics. They also highlight the importance of collecting data on factors such as occupation, household size, and neighborhood to understand the risk and harm associated with COVID-19 in different populations. Canada's failure to fund early pandemic research and share information like genomic profiling also contributed to a missed opportunity for a stronger, evidence-based public health response. The country's overall impression of adequacy, as described in the British Medical Journal, masks important inequalities and coordination issues.

Ontario's Health Minister, Sylvia Jones, has sidestepped calls for a national inquiry into COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes, emphasizing that the government is already taking action to improve the sector. While experts are advocating for an inquiry to ensure accountability for the tens of thousands of deaths in these facilities, Jones highlighted the government's investments in expanding and improving long-term care homes, eliminating four-bed rooms, and partnering with hospitals and community paramedics to enhance care. She also acknowledged that nursing homes had been neglected by previous governments and that the pandemic exposed these issues. Premier Doug Ford, when asked about an inquiry, only commented that the pandemic was a challenging time for everyone.

Title: Top medical experts call for national inquiry into Canada's COVID-19 'failures'
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
A group of medical experts is calling for a national inquiry into Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting shortcomings such as the devastation in long-term care homes, vaccine hoarding, and higher death rates among lower-income communities. The federal government has committed to a review but stops short of a full inquiry. The experts argue that an inquiry is necessary to hold accountable those responsible for the losses during the pandemic, including over 50,000 direct deaths and millions of infections. They also point to the fragmented and decentralized healthcare system, which led to inconsistent decision-making and inadequate data sharing. Racialized groups, recent immigrants, lower-wage essential workers, and individuals living in crowded conditions experienced the highest rates of cases and deaths. The country also faced criticism for its role in global vaccine distribution, with high-income countries like Canada claiming most of the available vaccines. Experts worry that without a full inquiry, mistakes made during the COVID-19 pandemic will be repeated in future public health crises.
