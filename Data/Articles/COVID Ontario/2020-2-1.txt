Posted: 1 day ago
As of March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, with the disease spreading to over 100 countries and causing major epidemics in several regions. The article provides answers to some commonly asked questions about the coronavirus at the time. Here is a summary: 1. What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that causes respiratory infections in humans. It is believed to have originated in bats and spread to humans through an intermediate animal host, possibly a pangolin. 2. Symptoms and death rate: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and dry cough. The case fatality rate (CFR) was estimated to be 2.3% based on data from mainland China, lower than SARS and MERS. However, the CFR has varied outside of China. Mild or asymptomatic cases may result in a lower overall CFR. 3. What to do if you think you have COVID-19: High-risk individuals should seek immediate medical treatment. Otherwise, stay home and contact a health professional. Self-isolation is important to prevent the spread of the disease. 4. How do coronaviruses spread? Coronaviruses primarily spread through exposure to droplets from coughing or sneezing. There is also evidence of fecal-oral transmission and potential airborne transmission. People with mild or no symptoms can still test positive and spread the virus. 5. Should I wear a face mask? Health experts advise that face masks are not necessary for the general population. They are recommended for those who are already infected or caring for someone who is sick. 6. Is COVID-19 a deadly pandemic? The declaration of a pandemic by the WHO indicates that the focus has shifted from containment to mitigation and harm reduction. The lethality of COVID-19 is still uncertain, and it is highly contagious, which has led to social distancing measures being implemented. 7. Travel advice: The CDC has issued travel alerts for countries with the largest known outbreaks (Italy, Iran, South Korea, and China). Travel restrictions and advisories are subject to change, so it is important to stay updated. The risk of acquiring a respiratory infection through air travel is low, but proximity to an infected individual increases the risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has rapidly spread from China to other countries. Despite the severe social and economic impact, the Chinese government's unprecedented response and containment measures have been effective, preventing many more cases and potential deaths outside of China. As of the declaration, there were 7,834 confirmed cases globally, with 7,736 in China and 170 deaths, all in China. The main reason for the declaration is to support countries with weaker health systems and prevent further spread. The WHO emphasized that this is not a vote of no confidence in China but a call for global solidarity and cooperation to combat the outbreak. They also provided recommendations for preventing the spread, including supporting countries with weaker health systems, accelerating vaccine development, combating misinformation, and sharing data and knowledge.

The article provides guidance on hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and cleaning/disinfecting high-touch areas to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These practices can also help reduce the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Hand hygiene is critical, and proper handwashing technique is outlined, emphasizing the need for 15-20 seconds of scrubbing with soap and water or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content in community settings and 70% in healthcare settings. Avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands is also advised. For coughing and sneezing, the guidance suggests coughing or sneezing into one's sleeve or elbow and using tissues when possible, disposing of them immediately, and always washing hands afterward. Additionally, frequent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces and shared spaces are recommended. High-touch surfaces include doorknobs, elevator buttons, light switches, toilet handles, counters, handrails, touch screen surfaces, keypads, and remote controls. Regular cleaning with common cleaners or disinfectants is effective against COVID-19, and instructions for making a disinfectant with bleach are provided. Overall, these practices can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and potentially lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.

Here is a summary of the article: Public health officials in Toronto, Canada, have confirmed the first "presumptive" case of the coronavirus, with the patient being a man in his 50s who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China. The man is in stable condition and is being treated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Officials are working to trace the man's steps and identify any potential contacts, including passengers on his flight from Guangzhou to Toronto. The man's family members are currently in self-isolation. Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the associate chief medical officer of health for the province, said that the man became "quite ill" within a day of his arrival. While the case has been confirmed by a test in Toronto, it still needs to be verified by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Officials believe the risk to Ontarians is low, and the health system is prepared to handle the situation. The article also provides information about the coronavirus, including its symptoms, prevention measures, and the global impact. It mentions that coronaviruses usually cause mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses, but can sometimes lead to severe diseases. Prevention measures include washing hands, coughing into the elbow, and avoiding crowded areas and close contact with animals when traveling to affected areas. The article also notes that the federal government has implemented measures to stem the risk and spread of the virus, including additional health screening questions for international travelers and messages on arrival screens at airports. British Columbia's health officials have also stated that the risk to the province is low, and they are closely monitoring the situation. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the following factors: The incubation period of the virus, which is currently estimated at 2-14 days. The transmission rate of the virus, which is currently unknown but believed to be similar to other coronaviruses. The severity of the illness, which can range from mild to severe, with severe cases requiring hospitalization. The availability and capacity of healthcare facilities to handle an influx of patients. The effectiveness of prevention and control measures implemented by public health officials. By considering these factors and monitoring the development of the outbreak, public health officials can forecast the potential impact on hospitalizations and prepare the healthcare system accordingly.
