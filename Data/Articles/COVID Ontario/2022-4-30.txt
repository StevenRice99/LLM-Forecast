Title: Unvaccinated people increase risk of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated: study - National

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that unvaccinated people threaten the safety of vaccinated people, even with high immunization rates. The study used an infectious disease model based on Ontario to reproduce the interactions between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations. The model found that attack rates among vaccinated people were highest when they were randomly mixed with unvaccinated people, and lowest when they were surrounded by other vaccinated people. The study also found that unvaccinated people had lower attack rates when mixing with vaccinated people, and that vaccinated people became a "buffer" that reduced the risk for unvaccinated people. The authors' findings remained consistent even when they modeled lower levels of vaccine effectiveness, such as in those who have not received a booster dose or with new variants of the virus. Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada showed that hospitalizations due to COVID-19 rose 18% across Canada between April 4 and April 11, with 6,020 people needing beds. In Ontario, the surgery waitlist has grown to between 225,000 to 250,000 patients. The article highlights the importance of collective action and vaccination in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing hospitalizations. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination rates and effectiveness Mixing patterns between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations Attack rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated people Hospitalization rates and surgery waitlists Collective action and public health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
