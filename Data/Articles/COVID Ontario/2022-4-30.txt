Title: Unvaccinated people increase risk of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated: study - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The study uses an infectious disease model based on Ontario to examine interactions between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations.
Key parameters include vaccine effectiveness, baseline immunity in unvaccinated people, and infection recovery rate.
Unvaccinated individuals are at higher risk of hospitalization when exposed to vaccinated individuals who become infected (acting as a buffer), but this risk decreases when mixing with other unvaccinated individuals.
The study's findings align with national data showing that the majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada are among the unvaccinated.
