Title: COVID-19 hospitalizations look different in the Omicron wave, and vaccination status is playing a part
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the current COVID-19 situation in Ontario, Canada, and how the Omicron variant is affecting hospitalization rates. The key points are:
The occupancy rate of unvaccinated people in ICUs is almost 15 times higher than that of fully vaccinated people.
Despite this, the gap between the numbers of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients in Ontario ICUs seems to be narrowing when judged by raw data.
However, when considering the size of the province's fully vaccinated population (now more than four times the size of the unvaccinated population) and the fact that the unvaccinated population skews young, the occupancy rate of unvaccinated people in ICUs remains significantly higher.
The article also mentions that while some patients are still experiencing severe symptoms and requiring mechanical ventilation, the overall proportion of patients needing this kind of treatment appears to be less during this wave than in previous ones.
Additionally, it is noted that shorter hospital stays (dropping from 13 days to six) will give the province more flexibility to treat higher numbers of patients.
The stress on the hospital system is being exacerbated by health workers isolating or taking sick leaves because of COVID-19, as well as pandemic fatigue and burnout.

A baby whose mother is unvaccinated or hasn't been previously infected doesn't receive protection of maternal antibodies. Children under 5 are ineligible for COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, making them more vulnerable to severe illness. Omicron variant has led to increased hospitalizations among young people due to high transmissibility and infection rates.
