Relevant article.
The delta variant is spreading rapidly in Canada and targets unvaccinated individuals.
Case counts are near rock-bottom, but public health officials warn that the fast-spreading variant keeps sparking outbreaks among unvaccinated people.
Vaccination rates in Ontario (70% have at least one dose) and nationally (40% fully vaccinated) provide high protection levels against severe illness, including hospitalization or death.
A Canadian study found leading vaccines offer high protection levels against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes after two doses.
The delta variant is putting Canada at a crossroads, with many Canadians being more protected while others are more at risk due to lower vaccination rates.

Title: Will we ever lock down again? Experts say it’s ‘unlikely,’ as pandemic finish line draws near - National

The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 in Canada and the prospects for a return to normalcy as the country enters the flu season.
Key points:
Ontario's ICU capacity remains a concern, with nearly 900 patients currently being treated.
Experts warn that this small capacity could become a problem, especially if unvaccinated individuals continue to contract the virus.
Canadians under 12 still don't have an approved vaccine available to them, but experts say this doesn't pose a significant risk to the hospital system.
Adults who choose not to get vaccinated are at higher risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19, which could lead to increased hospitalizations and tightened restrictions.
The portion of Canadians who are vaccine-hesitant is relatively small, around 18%, which reduces the risk of another lockdown.
Experts agree that a full return to normalcy will happen, but it's uncertain when exactly this will occur.
Overall, the article suggests that while there are still some unknowns and challenges ahead, Canada is likely to continue its trend towards normalcy as more people get vaccinated and the virus becomes less deadly.
