Title: The hunger virus multiplies: deadly recipe of conflict, Covid-19 and climate accelerate world hunger
Publisher: Oxfam International
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article highlights that deaths from hunger are now outpacing deaths from COVID-19, with 11 people dying per minute from acute hunger compared to 7 per minute from the pandemic. Conflict, COVID-19, and the climate crisis are the main drivers of this hunger crisis. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is important to consider the interplay of these three factors: 1. Conflict: Ongoing conflicts disrupt food production, supply chains, and access to food, leading to increased hunger and malnutrition. 2. COVID-19: The pandemic has caused economic disruptions, reducing incomes and access to food, especially for vulnerable populations. 3. Climate Crisis: The escalating climate crisis impacts food security by affecting crop yields, availability, and accessibility of food. To address the hunger crisis and improve COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts, the article emphasizes the need for governments to focus on funding urgent hunger response programs and social protection measures. By tackling food insecurity directly and addressing its root causes, governments can save lives and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, addressing hunger can help mitigate the indirect impact of COVID-19, preventing it from causing more deaths through hunger-related complications.

Title: Telehealth: A quarter-trillion-dollar post-COVID-19 reality?
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: Telehealth usage increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with utilization rates 78 times higher in April 2020 compared to February 2020. This change was driven by increased consumer and provider willingness to use telehealth, as well as regulatory changes that enabled greater access and reimbursement. As of July 2021, telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38 times higher than pre-pandemic, with 13-17% of all outpatient/office visits being conducted via telehealth. Consumer and provider attitudes towards telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era, with around 40% of consumers stating they will continue to use telehealth and 58% of physicians viewing telehealth more favorably. Some regulatory changes that expanded telehealth access have been made permanent, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' reimbursement for certain telehealth codes. However, there is uncertainty about the fate of other temporary waivers when the public health emergency ends. Investment in virtual health has skyrocketed, with venture capitalist investment in digital health in 2020 being three times higher than in 2017. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating beyond "virtual urgent care" to include longitudinal virtual care, integration of telehealth with other virtual health solutions, and hybrid virtual/in-person care models. Telehealth uptake varies by specialty, with the highest penetration in psychiatry (50%) and substance use treatment (30%). Challenges to scaling virtual care include improving data integration and workflow integration for clinicians, aligning incentives with value-based care, and addressing concerns about security and reimbursement. The potential impact of telehealth includes improved convenience, access to care, patient outcomes, and efficiency in the healthcare system. The authors estimate that up to $250 billion of current US healthcare spend could potentially be shifted to virtual or virtually enabled care. The article also includes an update from May 29, 2020, highlighting the massive acceleration in telehealth usage during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions that consumer adoption skyrocketed, with 46% of consumers using telehealth to replace canceled healthcare visits. Providers also rapidly scaled offerings, with a significant increase in the number of patients seen via telehealth. The update emphasizes the potential for up to $250 billion of current US healthcare spend to be virtualized due to the accelerated adoption and expansion of telehealth beyond "virtual urgent care."

Title: Five tips to avoid COVID-19 misinformation online
Publisher: University of Calgary
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in medical misinformation online, leading to the creation of the ScienceUpFirst movement, which aims to provide accurate and transparent information to the public. One of the members of this coalition, Dr. Jonathan N. Stea, offers five tips to help people navigate the information landscape: 1. Pause and reflect on the accuracy of content before sharing: Research shows that people often spread misinformation because they don't take the time to stop and think critically about what they're reading or hearing. 2. Improve scientific and media literacy: By understanding how science is conducted and communicated, people can better spot misinformation. This includes knowing the difference between correlation and causation and understanding the nature of clinical trials. 3. Be cautious of sensational language: Be wary of people or sources that use hype or pseudo-scientific language, such as claiming "breakthroughs" or "revolutionary treatments." This is often a red flag for misinformation. 4. Be suspicious of anecdotal evidence: Testimonials and personal stories are not a substitute for high-quality scientific evidence. Be especially cautious when encountering COVID-19 or vaccine information on social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook, which are rife with anecdotal evidence. 5. Consult trusted sources: ScienceUpFirst provides a list of credible sources on its website, including Health Canada, the CDC, and the World Health Organization. These sources provide transparent and accurate information that the public can rely on. By following these tips and improving media literacy, people can better navigate the flood of information about COVID-19 and make more informed decisions about their health.

Title: Regular rapid testing detects COVID-19 soon enough to stop transmission in schools
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses a study by Simon Fraser University researchers that found that proactive and frequent rapid testing of all students for COVID-19 is more effective at preventing large transmission clusters in schools than measures that are only taken when someone develops symptoms. The study used a mathematical model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a classroom of 25 students and tested the effectiveness of two different transmission control strategies. The first strategy involved students staying home and getting tested with a PCR test when they developed symptoms, with control measures introduced in the classroom if the test result was positive. The second strategy involved regular rapid testing of all students, whether they had symptoms or not, with interventions to prevent further transmission when a student tested positive. The study found that in scenarios with high transmission rates, the first control strategy was too slow to prevent large outbreaks, while the second strategy, using rapid tests to screen the entire population and catch infections early, was more effective at preventing large outbreaks. The researchers concluded that interventions that only take effect after someone develops symptoms and tests positive are too slow to prevent large clusters, and that regular monitoring of asymptomatic individuals is necessary to prevent the worst outcomes. As Canada moves towards reopening, including the return to school in the fall, the study highlights the potential value of regular rapid testing in preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in schools and other similar settings, such as workplaces or long-term care homes. The research results could also help inform the most effective interventions after a case is detected, such as mask use, improved ventilation, and hand washing.

Title: National Institute on Ageing Launches Free Online Calculator to Assess People’s COVID-19 Risk When Gathering with Others
Publisher: Toronto Metropolitan University
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ryerson University's National Institute on Aging (NIA) has developed an online tool called the "My COVID-19 Visit Risk Calculator" to help Canadians assess their risk of exposure to COVID-19 when gathering with others. This tool was launched in September 2021 and was designed to be used alongside public health guidelines to help make safer choices during the pandemic. The calculator, available at COVIDVisitRisk.com, takes approximately three minutes to complete and provides users with a personalized risk assessment based on their answers to a series of questions. It was developed by NIA Director of Health Policy Research, Dr. Samir Sinha, in collaboration with public health and infectious disease experts, and funded in part by the Government of Canada. The article also mentions that, in addition to the quick calculator, there is a more comprehensive decision aid available that provides a detailed assessment of potential COVID-19 exposure risks. Dr. Sinha states that the tool uses the best available scientific evidence to support informed decisions about visiting with others during the pandemic. As of September 2021, when the tool was relaunched, it was intended to reflect the back-to-school and holiday season, which could potentially impact COVID-19 hospitalization rates. The tool could help individuals understand their risk of exposure during these periods of increased social interaction and travel. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider various factors, including vaccination rates, adherence to public health measures, and the prevalence of new variants. Tools like the COVID-19 Visit Risk Calculator can help individuals make informed decisions to reduce their risk of infection and, consequently, the burden on the healthcare system.

Title: Emergency Co-ordination Centre winds down as COVID-19 numbers fall
Publisher: Alberta Health Services
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article summarizes the transition of the Emergency Coordination Centre (ECC) in Alberta Health Services (AHS) as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. The ECC has been a crucial part of AHS's COVID-19 response for 18 months, working with other organizations to provide an integrated response to the pandemic. Now, as the restrictions ease, the ECC is transitioning into the Readiness and Recovery Centre, managing over 3,000 COVID-19-related documents and anchoring innovative pandemic responses into the fabric of AHS. Dr. Laura McDougall, Senior Medical Officer of Health, notes that some documents will be archived and used for future communicable disease and pandemic responses. The ECC is not new to AHS and has supported responses to previous emergencies such as the H1N1 pandemic and the Fort McMurray wildfires. Looking ahead, the team remains cautious about the pandemic's global situation and is prepared to ramp up responses if needed. While there is hope and light at the end of the tunnel, the healthcare system needs to stay ready for any potential challenges.

Title: COVID-19 has delayed criminal trials across Canada. Is the justice system doing enough to address the problem?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in the Canadian justice system, with many trials being postponed due to safety concerns and pandemic-related restrictions. In the case of the murder trial of Greg Fertuck, the judge postponed the trial by six months due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in nearby Regina, despite it being scheduled to begin in Saskatoon on March 29, 2021. The right to a timely trial is guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Supreme Court's Jordan rule sets time limits on how long an accused person should have to wait for their trial. However, the pandemic has caused many cases to exceed these deadlines, raising questions about the handling of such delays. Judges across Canada have ruled that the pandemic qualifies as "exceptional circumstances," excluding COVID-19 delays from the Jordan deadlines. While some lawyers express concern about the lack of scrutiny on the justice system's role in avoiding delays, others believe that the system has adapted quickly and effectively. The use of video link technology has been successful in some trials, but in-person appearances are still considered crucial for assessing witness credibility. The pandemic is expected to bring long-term systemic change to the justice system, with a potential shift towards more virtual proceedings.

Title: Pins, stickers, T-shirts: Is there value in wearing your COVID-19 vaccine status? - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
COVID-19 vaccine-themed merchandise, such as T-shirts, mugs, and pins, is becoming popular in Canada as more people get vaccinated. One seller on Etsy, Mark W. Gray, has sold thousands of "Fully Vaccinated" pins since March, indicating that the demand for such products is high. Health communication experts suggest that wearing these symbols can serve as a safety signal to others and raise vaccine awareness. It can also help initiate conversations about vaccine concerns and side effects. In the United States, a company called ImmunaBand has introduced a silicone bracelet that links a QR code to the wearer's vaccination record. While there is no obligation to prove vaccination status in Canada, wearing a symbol can help put people at ease and encourage others to get vaccinated, according to experts. However, it may also create divisions and cause discomfort for those who are not yet vaccinated or are hesitant. Matt Streem, president of Covid Status Wear, says their magnetic pins and masks indicating vaccination status can help people feel safer and avoid awkward conversations about their COVID-19 status. The demand for these products reflects the desire for social connection and the willingness to follow the actions of others.
