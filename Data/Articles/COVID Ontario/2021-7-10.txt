TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: The delta variant is spreading rapidly and targeting unvaccinated individuals, who are at a higher risk of infection and hospitalization. Canada has a high level of protection, with 40% of Canadians fully vaccinated and 70% having at least one dose, which has led to a drop in case counts. However, there are still millions of unvaccinated individuals, including children under 12, who are at risk of infection and hospitalization. Experts warn that as Canada reopens, the delta variant will continue to spread, and unvaccinated individuals will act as "kindling to a flame". A recent study in Ontario found that the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford, and Moderna vaccines offer high protection levels against severe illness, but only after two doses. The article highlights the importance of getting more people fully vaccinated to keep the delta variant at bay and prevent further exacerbation of inequalities seen throughout the pandemic. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination rates, particularly the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals Case counts and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals Spread of the delta variant and its impact on hospitalizations and deaths Effectiveness of vaccines against severe illness and hospitalization Demographic factors, such as age and ethnicity, that may affect vaccination rates and hospitalization outcomes.

Title: Will we ever lock down again? Experts say it’s ‘unlikely,’ as pandemic finish line draws near - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: Over 75% of Canadians over 12 have received at least one vaccine dose, and more than 20% are fully vaccinated. Experts believe that the chances of another lockdown are unlikely due to the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe outcomes and hospitalizations. Hospitalizations, rather than case counts, are becoming a more important indicator of potential lockdowns. Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing hospitalizations, with clinical trial data from all five vaccines considered for approval in Canada showing zero hospitalizations or deaths among vaccinated individuals. Even with the emergence of new variants, experts believe that the vaccines will continue to be effective in preventing severe outcomes and hospitalizations. The main concern is now hospital capacity, particularly in Ontario, where ICU capacity was exceeded during the third wave with only 900 patients admitted. The unvaccinated population, including children under 12 and adults who choose not to get vaccinated, may still pose a risk for increased hospitalizations and tightened restrictions. However, experts believe that the portion of Canadians who are vaccine-hesitant is relatively small, and that outbreaks among the unvaccinated will not be enough to force another lockdown. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada are likely to remain low and manageable, and that a return to normalcy is possible in the near future.
