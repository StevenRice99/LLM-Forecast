The article presents a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, addressing the question, "How do we know that they work?". It begins by distinguishing between efficacy in controlled clinical trials and real-world effectiveness. During clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines demonstrated high efficacy, with a reduction in COVID-19 cases among vaccinated individuals. However, real-world data from Israel, Europe, and the United States provides stronger evidence of the vaccines' success. In Israel, the Pfizer vaccine showed 92% effectiveness in preventing infection, 87% in preventing hospitalization, and 92% in preventing severe disease. Similar results were observed in studies from Scotland, Southern Italy, and the CDC in the US, indicating high vaccine effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and infection. Additionally, vaccinated healthcare workers in Israel and Finland experienced lower COVID-19 incidence than their unvaccinated peers, and their unvaccinated household members also benefited from indirect protection. While the studies have limitations regarding the time frame, population representation, and potential biases, the overall body of evidence strongly suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines work remarkably well. Furthermore, early data indicates only a slight decrease in vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant. In conclusion, the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Canada have proven effective in large-scale trials and real-world settings, reducing infections, hospitalizations, and even providing some protection to unvaccinated household members. The final takeaway emphasizes the somber reality that the majority of COVID-19 deaths occur among the unvaccinated, underscoring the importance of immunization.

Title: Why mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for health-care workers could help Canada fight a 4th wave
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The debate over mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for healthcare workers in Canada is growing as more countries adopt this approach to protect healthcare settings and control the spread of more contagious variants. While Canada lacks detailed data on vaccinated healthcare workers, over 80% of eligible Canadians have received one dose, and nearly 60% are fully vaccinated. Proponents of mandatory vaccination argue that healthcare workers have been required to be vaccinated against other infectious diseases for decades, including some less severe than COVID-19. They emphasize the responsibility of healthcare workers to protect their patients and the potential impact of unvaccinated staff on the healthcare system during a fourth wave. Opponents, including some provincial premiers, argue that individuals have a "constitutional right" to choose whether to be vaccinated. Experts highlight the need for leadership and urgent action to ensure stability in the healthcare system and prevent future outbreaks in vulnerable settings.

The article discusses the complex and nuanced issue of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and how it is becoming a culture war on social media. While COVID-19 vaccines are proven to be effective and saving lives, a sizeable number of people are still reluctant to get vaccinated. Psychologists who specialize in medical decision-making argue that vaccine hesitancy is influenced by various psychological and social factors that need to be addressed sensitively to achieve population-level immunity. The article introduces the 5Cs model, which considers confidence, complacency, calculation, constraints (or convenience), and collective responsibility as key factors in vaccine hesitancy. It also highlights the impact of cognitive biases such as negativity bias, optimism bias, and confirmation bias on people's perceptions of vaccine risks and benefits. Social factors, such as convenience and accessibility of vaccine centers, and structural racism that leads to lower trust in medical authorities among certain ethnic groups, also play a role in vaccine hesitancy. To improve vaccine uptake, health authorities should provide easy-to-understand information that addresses concerns about side effects and adequate testing. A targeted approach, collaborating with influencer role models within communities, can help provide consistent and accurate information. Engaging in open dialogue and respectful conversations that acknowledge people's concerns is crucial for building trust and improving vaccine acceptance.

Here is a summary of the article: As of July 20, 2021, 80% of eligible people 12 and older in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 54.4% have received their second dose. There were 76 new cases of COVID-19 reported in B.C., bringing the total number of cases in the province to 148,563. The province currently has 692 active cases, with 50 people hospitalized and 12 in intensive care. The new and active cases are distributed across five regional health authorities: Fraser Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Interior Health, Northern Health, and Island Health. There have been no new deaths reported in the last 24 hours, with a total of 1,763 deaths in the province due to COVID-19. Currently, there are two active outbreaks in acute care and long-term care facilities in B.C. Since December 2020, the province has administered over 6.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vaccination rate, the number of active cases, and the severity of those cases. The high vaccination rate in B.C. is encouraging and should help reduce the number of hospitalizations. However, the increase in new cases and active outbreaks could lead to a rise in hospitalizations, especially if a large proportion of new cases are among unvaccinated individuals. It is also important to monitor the occupancy of intensive care units and the overall capacity of the healthcare system to manage a potential surge in hospitalizations.

Australia's two largest states, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, reported sharp increases in new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, July 21st, 2021, raising concerns about the effectiveness of lockdown measures. NSW reported 110 new cases, while Victoria recorded 22 new cases. Health leaders have expressed concern about the number of people active in the community before receiving their coronavirus diagnosis, emphasizing that this number should be near zero before lifting lockdowns. The NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, attributed the rise in cases to the highly contagious Delta variant and acknowledged that more work needs to be done to control the outbreak. The state of South Australia also entered a week-long lockdown, reporting one additional case. Australia's sluggish immunization program has been a source of criticism for the federal government, with only 11% of the population fully vaccinated. The main vaccine used in Australia, developed by AstraZeneca, has been recommended for people over 60 due to rare blood clotting risks, while the Pfizer vaccine has been restricted to those over 40 due to limited supply. Despite the challenges, Australia has kept COVID-19 numbers relatively low, with just over 32,100 cases and 915 deaths as of July 21st, 2021. However, the increase in cases and the presence of the Delta variant may lead to extended lockdowns and further strain on the healthcare system, making it crucial to closely monitor the situation and adjust public health measures as necessary.

This article offers guidance to policymakers on COVID-19 measures for schools in Ontario for September 2021. It emphasizes the importance of in-person learning for the well-being and development of children and recommends that schools remain open unless there are catastrophic circumstances. The level of COVID-19 burden in the community should dictate the degree of school-based measures, with permanent measures such as vaccination, excluding sick individuals, hand hygiene, ventilation, and cleaning in place regardless of the pandemic situation. Temporary measures like masking and physical distancing should be adjusted according to COVID-19 disease burden and consider student age, grade, and vaccination status. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article defines three scenarios: low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk. In a low-risk scenario, temporary measures in schools include contact tracing, low-barrier testing, and a permissive approach to masking. In moderate and high-risk scenarios, more temporary measures are warranted, with a focus on cohorting and masking requirements for students based on their age and grade level. The article also acknowledges the negative impact of school closures and remote learning on children's mental and physical health, learning losses, and the disruption of essential services provided by schools. It emphasizes that community-based public health measures should be the preferred mechanism for pandemic control, and school closures should only be considered under catastrophic circumstances or when recommended by the Chief Medical Officer of Health.

Here is a summary of the article: Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) has played a crucial role in supporting the Canadian Armed Forces' (CAF) response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DRDC scientists and researchers have quickly adapted their programs and projects to address the unique challenges faced by CAF members during the pandemic. One issue addressed by DRDC was the heat and discomfort experienced by CAF members when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) for extended periods. Dr. Matthew Cramer from DRDC Toronto Research Centre studied the heat strain of wearing PPE and provided recommendations for cooling and break scheduling to mitigate potential effects on attention and decision-making. DRDC scientists are also researching potential treatments for COVID-19. For example, Dr. Henry Peng and Dr. Shawn Rhind are investigating the potential use of freeze-dried plasma, which could be stockpiled and used for passive immunization or as a therapy for those without access to vaccines. Additionally, DRDC Suffield Research Centre has provided essential support to ongoing CAF operations by processing a large number of COVID-19 tests, enabling command decisions and the continuation of operations. In the first six months of 2021, DRDC Suffield processed more than 10,500 COVID-19 tests, representing 44% of domestic CAF operational tests. Overall, DRDC's agile and diverse response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates its commitment to developing science and technology solutions to meet the current and future needs of the CAF. Their contributions have helped to protect CAF members and the Canadian public during the pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, some important facts to consider include the number of new cases, the positivity rate, and the reproduction rate of the virus. Additionally, understanding the impact of COVID-19 variants and the vaccination rate in the population can also help predict the strain on the healthcare system. By analyzing these factors, public health officials can make informed decisions about implementing measures to control the spread and prepare healthcare resources.
