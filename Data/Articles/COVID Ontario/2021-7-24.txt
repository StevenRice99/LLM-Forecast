This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article provides guidance on COVID-19 mitigation measures for schools in Ontario, emphasizing the importance of in-person learning for children's overall well-being. It suggests that schools should remain open for in-person learning, except in catastrophic circumstances, and that the level of community COVID-19 burden should inform the degree of school-based measures. The article defines three broad scenarios of COVID-19 disease burden: low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk, based on the level of severe disease requiring hospitalization and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It recommends adjusting temporary measures in schools, such as masking, physical distancing, and cohorting, according to the community risk scenario. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: The level of community COVID-19 burden, including the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization and SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates. Vaccination coverage rates, particularly among eligible individuals. The impact of school closures and transitions to remote learning on children's physical and mental health. The importance of in-person learning for children's overall well-being and the need to prioritize sustained in-person school attendance. Overall, the article provides a framework for adapting COVID-19 mitigation measures in schools based on community risk, which can inform forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Over 61% of Ontarians 12 and older are fully vaccinated, which is expected to continue to grow and keep the probability of severe infections and hospitalizations low. The report suggests that students should return to in-person learning in September, which could potentially lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, especially if certain measures are not taken. The recommended permanent measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission include vaccinating all eligible residents, staying home when sick, having adequate indoor air quality, proper cleaning, and good hand hygiene. Temporary measures such as contact tracing, testing, and mask-wearing may be necessary in moderate to high-risk scenarios. The report defines a catastrophic scenario where schools should be closed as when there is a risk of serious symptoms or death related to children attending in-person classes. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the current vaccination rates, the planned return to in-person learning, and the measures being taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Title: Yes, vaccines curb COVID-19 transmission — but that's not enough to protect those without a shot
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination efforts are reducing severe cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations, particularly among fully vaccinated individuals. Breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals are rare and typically mild. Cases of serious illness leading to hospitalization or death are now largely appearing among unvaccinated populations. The delta variant is taking hold in Ontario, making up close to 75% of cases, but daily deaths have dropped significantly since vaccination efforts began. Unvaccinated individuals are driving transmission, and pockets of unvaccinated individuals remain, particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates. The article highlights the importance of achieving high vaccination rates to prevent onward transmission and protect unvaccinated individuals. These points suggest that vaccination rates, particularly among high-risk populations, will be a crucial factor in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Additionally, the spread of variants, such as the delta variant, will also impact hospitalization rates.
