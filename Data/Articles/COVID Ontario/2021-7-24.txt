Title: Active COVID-19 cases in Ottawa rise as vaccinations slow
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here are the values most important for forecasting:
41 active cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa
0 patients in hospital with COVID-19 related illnesses (9th straight day)
Positivity rate in Ottawa: 0.5 per cent
Reproduction number: 1.28 (up from 1.18), indicating the virus is spreading and each case infects more than one contact.
Vaccination rates: 83% of eligible residents have received at least one shot, 69% are now fully vaccinated.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccine Certificates: Key Considerations for the Ontario Context
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The text discusses the potential benefits and implications of implementing COVID-19 vaccine certificates, particularly in the context of reopening high-risk settings such as restaurants, gyms, and events. Here are the main points:
Benefits: 
1. Reducing infection, hospitalization, and severe illness from COVID-19
2. Limiting participation of higher-risk activities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission to vaccinated individuals who hold vaccine certificates
3. Potential long-term uses:
Verifying vaccination status in schools, workplaces, and travel
Supporting individual and public health surveillance
Real-world example: 
1. Israel implemented COVID-19 vaccine certificates alongside reopening of high-risk settings; they did not see an increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases or COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
Methodology: 
1. A search was conducted across various databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and COVID-19-specific resources.
2. The search was last updated on June 11, 2021.
Limitations: 
1. There is currently no direct scientific evidence of the impact of COVID-19 vaccine certificates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission or vaccine coverage.
2. Infectious diseases modeling could help estimate the potential benefit of vaccine certificates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in higher-risk settings.
Implications for Ontario, Canada: 
1. The province has a high vaccination rate (79.6% with at least one dose and 62.2% fully vaccinated), which may limit the short-term need for COVID-19 vaccine certificates to access high-risk settings.
2. However, the emergence of the Delta variant and future variants of concern make establishing an infrastructure for COVID-19 vaccine certification useful.
Ethical considerations: 
1. Important ethical, legal, accessibility, and privacy considerations should guide the design and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine certificates to ensure effects are not disproportionate to the aim.
2. Provincial and territorial governments may want to develop a common design of vaccine certificates that reflects key development and implementation principles.

Title: School Operation for the 2021-2022 Academic Year in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True

The provided text does not appear to be a Q&A format, but rather a comprehensive guide on COVID-19 mitigation strategies for schools. However, I can attempt to summarize the key points and answer some related questions.
Key Points: 
1. Large spaces: Prioritize large, well-ventilated spaces for activities that generate aerosols (e.g., music rooms, auditoriums).
2. Plexiglass barriers: Not recommended as they don't reduce transmission and may create turbulence.
3. Cafeterias, playgrounds, and libraries: Closing or restricting these areas has not shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
4. Rapid antigen screen testing: Consider using in high-risk scenarios for extra-curricular activities with significant aerosol dispersion (e.g., choir, band).
5. Transportation: Consider temporary health and safety measures on public transportation during periods of moderate-to-high risk.
Related Questions: 
1. What are the recommended strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools?
Answer: Prioritize large spaces, use rapid antigen screen testing in high-risk scenarios, and consider temporary health and safety measures on public transportation.
2. Are plexiglass barriers effective in reducing transmission?
Answer: No, they have not been shown to reduce transmission and may create turbulence.
3. What is the "Test-To-Play" strategy mentioned in the text?
Answer: A strategy that requires testing every 14 days for participants in high school extracurricular activities (described in Utah's COVID-19 School Manual).
Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

Title: Ontario students should return to class barring catastrophe, report says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

Relevant.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
- Provincewide vaccination rates (61% of Ontarians 12+ are fully vaccinated)
- Probability of severe infections and hospitalizations (should remain low with higher vaccination rates)
- COVID-19 levels (currently low)

Title: 'River and Sky' festival returns to the delight of fans
Publisher: CTV News Northern Ontario
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Relevant values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Number of attendees (approximate 1000) with vaccination proof and rapid COVID-19 tests
No positive COVID-19 tests reported at the festival gate
Stringent measures to prevent potential outbreaks (proof of vaccination, rapid testing, contact tracing bracelets)
Comparison of this year's festival experience to previous years' events

Title: Yes, vaccines curb COVID-19 transmission — but that's not enough to protect those without a shot
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the impact of COVID-19 vaccine rollout on infection rates among unvaccinated individuals. Studies have shown that vaccinated populations help protect unvaccinated ones, with a decline in infections among the latter as vaccination rates increase.
A study published in The Lancet found that a 10-percentage-point rise in COVID-19 vaccination coverage in 177 communities led to a significant decrease in cases and hospitalizations among unvaccinated youth. Another study from Public Health England found that three weeks after a single vaccine dose, household transmission of the virus was reduced by 40-50%.
However, despite these findings, variants such as delta are spreading rapidly across Africa, where vaccination rates are low, leading to increased infection rates and hospitalization pressures. In some countries, there are shortages of intensive care beds.
Experts warn that unvaccinated individuals are driving transmission and are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. A stark split has emerged between those who have received vaccines and those who have not, with the former experiencing reduced case counts and hospitalizations while the latter bear the brunt of the virus's spread.
In the US, nearly all COVID-19 deaths are now among unvaccinated individuals. In Canada, similarly, hospitalization and death rates have been skewed towards unvaccinated populations in provinces such as Saskatchewan.
The article concludes that spotty vaccine coverage could lead to continued disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated communities.
