Title: Lessons Learned from Israel’s Reopening During a Nationwide COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
This text is a science brief discussing Israel's approach to reopening its economy and society during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are the main points:
Israel's Reopening Strategy 
Israel used a phased reopening strategy, aligned with improving epidemiological indicators, increasing vaccine uptake, and maintaining key public health measures.
The country lifted restrictions on June 1, 2021, after achieving low nationwide SARS-CoV-2 infection numbers (17 new cases) and high COVID-19 vaccine coverage.
The only remaining public health measure was indoor masking.
Key Initiatives 
Green Pass: a digital certificate that required proof of vaccination or COVID-19 recovery to enter certain businesses, such as restaurants, hotels, gyms, and non-essential workplaces.
Purple Badge standard: ensured safe operation in non-essential workplaces and retail stores without requiring customers to show proof of vaccination or COVID-19 recovery.
Vaccine Uptake and Success Factors 
Israel's simple prioritization process, effective communication, digital infrastructure, and small geographical area and population size contributed to its successful vaccine rollout and uptake.
The country incentivized vaccines for hesitant groups through the Green Pass approach.
Concerns and Limitations 
Equity concerns: the Green Pass approach may have exacerbated existing social inequities by incentivizing vaccines for high-risk individuals but not addressing barriers to access for those who lacked confidence in vaccination.
Privacy concerns: those checking credentials had access to private health information, albeit limited to vaccination status.
Relevance to Ontario's Reopening Strategy 
Examining Israel's reopening strategy is instructive for Ontario's own planning and implementation of its reopening strategy.
Considerations should include the phased approach, short timeline, high vaccine coverage, and absence of a surge in SARS-CoV-2 cases following the lifting of restrictions.
Other promising practices to consider include the Green Pass approach, emphasizing outdoor activities, supporting a safe return to social and communal events, and implementing public health measures.
Overall, the text highlights Israel's successful reopening strategy, its key initiatives, and the lessons learned that can inform Ontario's own approach.
