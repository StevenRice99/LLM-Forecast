Title: Most labs in Canada not fully able to detect Delta COVID-19 variant, experts warn
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Here is a summary of the article: Experts in Canada warn that the current efforts to identify COVID-19 variants, particularly the Delta B.1.617 variant, may be insufficient to effectively track its spread across the country. Dr. Laurence Pelletier notes that many public health units lack the necessary equipment to fully sequence and identify COVID-19 variants, especially those with multiple mutations like Delta. Conventional PCR tests used by most labs can only detect one or two specific mutations, limiting their effectiveness against variants with more mutations. This has made it challenging to distinguish the Delta variant, which accounts for a growing proportion of new cases. Pelletier and his colleague, Dr. Jeff Wrana, employed a new testing method that revealed Delta's presence in about 20% of new positive cases in their data, suggesting its prevalence could be higher than reported. They advocate for more widespread use of their faster and more cost-effective sequencing method. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, acknowledges the importance of sequencing but emphasizes that Canada is doing more sequencing than many other countries as cases decline. She also highlights the increasing evidence of Delta's higher transmissibility and the effectiveness of two vaccine doses against it. Dr. Gerald A. Evans, an infectious disease specialist, agrees that the Delta variant's absence of the N501Y mutation makes it harder to detect with rapid PCR tests designed for other variants. While there are challenges in determining the true spread of the Delta variant, Evans remains cautiously optimistic, attributing Canada's low case numbers to a combination of increased vaccination and strict public health measures. He believes that the country is in a different phase of the pandemic and is less concerned about the impact of the Delta variant, given the current context.

This article discusses the importance of the sense of smell and how its loss, known as anosmia, has been a prominent symptom of COVID-19. Here are the key points: Smell is linked to memory, emotion, and taste, and its loss can be devastating and linked to depression. Anosmia is a common first symptom of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses like the common cold. If you experience a loss of smell or taste, you should self-isolate and get tested for COVID-19. Smell dysfunction likely affects a large portion of people, and taste is usually affected too. The cause of smell dysfunction is not fully understood but may be due to damage to sustentacular cells, which support olfactory neurons. In most cases, smell recovers quickly, often within four weeks, but some may experience permanent loss or long-term impairment. Unusual smells, known as phantosmia, can also occur, and may be unpleasant or make normally pleasant smells seem foul. There is no proven treatment for long-term smell dysfunction, but olfactory training and short-term use of topical corticosteroid sprays may help. Prevention through mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccination is the best strategy. This article highlights the impact of anosmia as a COVID-19 symptom and provides important information for those experiencing smell or taste dysfunction. The potential for quick recovery in most cases and the possibility of permanent loss in some individuals could be factors to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Publisher: AJMC.com Managed Markets Network
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article provides a detailed timeline of the key events related to COVID-19 vaccine development, approval, and distribution in the United States from January to March 2021. Here is a summary of the important facts and developments: March 11, 2021, marks the one-year anniversary of the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As of March 10, the CDC reported that over 93.6 million vaccine doses had been administered in the US, with Alaska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Connecticut having the highest doses per 100,000 residents. Three vaccines have been approved by the FDA, with Moderna and the FDA discussing the possibility of half-dose regimens to vaccinate more people. The UK began distributing the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which can be stored at refrigerator temperatures. The FDA advised against altering vaccine schedules, stating that potential changes could be premature and there is insufficient evidence of their efficacy compared to approved 2-dose schedules. Moderna announced plans to increase production to 600 million doses for 2021 and aimed to allocate resources to produce 1 billion doses total. HHS announced that the CDC would provide over $22 billion in funding for states and territories to support the COVID-19 response, including vaccine distribution and testing. The CDC stated that the benefits of the vaccines outweighed the risk of allergic reactions, with reports of 21 allergic reactions out of nearly 2 million vaccinated individuals. A study showed that patients with heart failure should be prioritized for vaccines as they had a higher risk of death from COVID-19. The American Hospital Association pushed for a faster and more standardized vaccine rollout, criticizing the lack of progress reports and disparate plans implemented by states. Health officials enlisted pharmacies ahead of schedule to address delays in vaccine distribution. Then-President-elect Joe Biden announced plans to rapidly release most COVID-19 vaccine doses to inoculate more people, reversing Trump's policy of holding back second doses. States faced significant hurdles in implementing mass vaccination programs due to staff shortages, budget constraints, and surging COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Biden's goal remained 100 million vaccinations in 100 days, pledging to release all available doses and reverse the previous administration's decision to hold back second doses. The CDC and HHS updated vaccine allocation guidance, basing future supplies on administration rates and the population of residents 65 and older in each state. Confusion and delays were reported in Los Angeles County, California, due to conflicting messages from state and local officials regarding vaccine eligibility for elderly residents. A GoodRx report highlighted the issue of "pharmacy deserts," predicting that limited pharmacy access would affect vaccine accessibility, particularly in rural and urban areas. Reports of racial disparities in vaccination rates showed that Black Americans were being vaccinated at lower rates compared to White Americans, with COVID-19 mortality remaining higher in Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations. Researchers identified a COVID-19 variant in California, named L452R, which may be less susceptible to current vaccines. The prevalence of this variant was increasing. Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca began testing their vaccines in adolescents, with Moderna focusing on 12to 18-year-olds, Pfizer recruiting 12to 15-year-olds, and AstraZeneca targeting 6to 18-year-olds. Incoming CDC Director Rochelle Walensky pledged to prioritize vaccine rollout, increase vaccination sites, and improve communication to address vaccine hesitancy and disparities. Novavax reported dropouts in its vaccine trial as elderly individuals sought to determine if they had received a placebo and wanted to get an approved vaccine. California reported a spate of allergic reactions possibly related to a specific lot of Moderna's vaccine, leading to a pause and investigation before vaccinations resumed. Research indicated that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was effective against the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant first discovered in the UK. Amazon offered to assist the Biden administration in vaccine distribution, leveraging its operational and technological capabilities. CDC data showed that the Moderna vaccine could induce rare anaphylactic reactions, similar to those observed with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that while COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective against variants from South Africa, the UK, and Brazil, they would still likely provide protection. Health officials across the US reported limited vaccine supply, which the new CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, aimed to address after the Biden administration's first 100 days. Merck discontinued the development of two potential COVID-19 vaccines due to poor early-stage study results, shifting focus to assessing treatments for the disease. Moderna announced plans to develop booster shots to combat emerging variants, including one targeting the South African variant. The Biden administration planned to increase the US vaccine supply by 50% by purchasing an additional 200 million doses for delivery through the summer. Sanofi granted BioNTech access to a German plant to boost the EU's vaccine supply by over 125 million doses, as Sanofi's own vaccine development faced delays. Johnson & Johnson and Novavax released positive Phase 3 trial data for their respective COVID-19 vaccine candidates. These developments provide a snapshot of the ongoing efforts to develop, approve, and distribute COVID-19 vaccines in the US during the first quarter of 2021. The timeline highlights the challenges, adjustments, and progress made in the race to vaccinate Americans against the novel coronavirus.

Title: Workers receiving payments from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit program in 2020
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the characteristics of Canadian workers who received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in 2020 during the COVID-19 economic lockdowns. The focus is on workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. About one-third (35.2%) of these workers received CERB payments. Women were more likely to receive CERB than men, with 36.3% of women and 34.2% of men receiving payments. Workers in industries severely affected by the lockdowns, such as accommodation, food services, arts, entertainment, and recreation, were the most likely to receive CERB. In contrast, workers in industries like utilities, public administration, and finance were less likely to receive it. Low-wage workers were also more likely to receive CERB, with over half (55.3%) of those in the bottom 10% of the earnings distribution receiving payments. Young workers were more likely to receive CERB than older workers, with 50.4% of men and 53.9% of women aged 15-24 receiving payments. The proportions receiving CERB varied across provinces, with the hardest-hit provinces by the labor market downturn having higher proportions of CERB recipients. Visible minority workers were also more likely to receive CERB, with 41.4% of those in these groups receiving payments compared to 32.0% of non-visible minorities. Overall, the CERB provided financial support to a significant portion of Canadian workers affected by the COVID-19 economic lockdowns, with certain groups, including women, low-wage workers, young people, and visible minorities, being more likely to receive it. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered, including vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, and the implementation of public health measures. While the CERB data provides insights into the economic impact of the pandemic and the characteristics of those who may be at higher risk of infection or job loss, it is not a direct indicator of hospitalizations. However, by understanding the demographics and industries affected, public health officials can tailor their strategies to target these vulnerable groups and potentially mitigate the burden on the healthcare system.

Title: Lessons Learned from Israel’s Reopening During a Nationwide COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario's third wave of COVID-19, driven by variants of concern, put immense pressure on the healthcare system, peaking in mid-April 2021. Public health measures and vaccinations have since helped control the spread. Ontario's reopening plan, outlined in May 2021, consists of three steps based on vaccination rates and health indicators. The plan is aligned with PHAC modeling suggestions. Israel, with the highest proportion of fully vaccinated individuals globally, began its phased reopening in February 2021. Their approach involved lifting restrictions in stages, based on dates rather than health indicators. Israel's reopening started with outdoor spaces and schools, gradually expanding to other sectors. The 'Green Pass' system allowed fully vaccinated or recovered individuals access to certain establishments. By June 1, 2021, Israel had lifted most restrictions, including the 'Green Pass' and 'Purple Badge' requirements, while maintaining indoor masking. During Israel's phased reopening, new SARS-CoV-2 infections initially decreased, then increased slightly, followed by a more substantial decrease. COVID-19 hospitalizations and severe cases followed a similar trend with a lag. Israel's reopening occurred when vaccination coverage was lower than Ontario's current coverage. Ontario's infection rate is currently higher than Israel's at the start of its reopening. Israel's successful reopening suggests that a combination of high vaccination rates, public health measures, and a gradual approach can help control COVID-19 while resuming activities. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts can be considered: The impact of reopening on hospitalizations depends on various factors, including vaccination coverage, adherence to public health measures, and the presence of new variants. During Israel's phased reopening, hospitalizations initially decreased but increased slightly after the second phase. They decreased more substantially later. Ontario's current vaccination coverage is higher than Israel's at the start of its reopening, which may help prevent a significant surge in hospitalizations. Monitoring health indicators, such as hospitalization rates and ICU occupancy, is crucial for a safe and gradual reopening, as outlined in Ontario's plan. The presence of new variants, such as the Delta variant, could impact hospitalization forecasts and may require adjustments to the reopening plan.

Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses a new tool developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine that can forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States up to four weeks in advance with remarkable accuracy. This tool could help hospitals and public health officials anticipate resource needs and implement preventive measures to reduce the strain on healthcare systems. The tool uses a machine-learning model trained on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and other factors such as mobility data and mask usage. It can provide forecasts for each state and for the entire country. According to the researchers, the tool has been highly accurate in its predictions so far. For example, in mid-December 2021, the model predicted a steep rise in hospitalizations in Ohio, and indeed, hospitalizations doubled in the state within three weeks. The model also accurately predicted a surge in hospitalizations in New York and Pennsylvania during the Omicron wave. One of the key advantages of this tool is its ability to incorporate multiple data streams and adjust for underreporting of cases. This helps to provide a more accurate picture of the pandemic's trajectory and the impact on healthcare systems. The researchers plan to continue refining the tool and hope that it will be used by public health officials to make data-driven decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. They also plan to extend the model to forecast deaths and ICU admissions due to COVID-19. In terms of important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article mentions the following: The tool uses a machine-learning model trained on data from the CDC and other sources. It takes into account various factors such as COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, mobility data, and mask usage. The model has been highly accurate in its predictions so far, including anticipating surges in hospitalizations in multiple states. The researchers plan to extend the model to forecast deaths and ICU admissions due to COVID-19. The tool can provide forecasts up to four weeks in advance, which can help hospitals and public health officials prepare and allocate resources effectively. By utilizing this tool and considering the important facts mentioned, healthcare systems and public health officials can better anticipate and manage the impact of COVID-19 on their communities.

Title: Canada recommends mixing and matching AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) updated its guidelines on mixing COVID-19 vaccines for first and second doses. The new recommendations advise that a first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine can be followed by Moderna or Pfizer, and that Moderna and Pfizer shots can be used interchangeably. This decision is based on emerging research from Spain and the UK, which found that mixing vaccines was safe and effective at preventing COVID-19, with a robust immune response. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, stated that this concept of combining vaccines is not new and has been applied to other vaccines in the past. The updated guidelines also take into consideration the rare but serious blood clotting issue associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as VITT, which has a rate of between 1 in 83,000 and 1 in 55,000, and a high fatality rate. The Spanish study that informed NACI's decision found that mixing AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines resulted in a significant increase in IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies, with only a small percentage of participants reporting mild side effects. These updated guidelines will have a significant impact on Canada's vaccine rollout and provide flexibility in addressing supply issues.

Title: COVID-19: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): September to December 2020 data
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Canada. Here's a summary: The Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, conducted between September and December 2020, collected data on the mental health effects of the pandemic. PTSD is a mental health disorder that can occur after exposure to traumatic events, such as natural disasters or violence. Symptoms include disturbing memories, avoidance of triggers, and sleep disturbances. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a wide-ranging impact on individuals, families, and communities, and the stressors associated with it may increase the number of people experiencing PTSD symptoms. Those who already have PTSD may also experience a worsening of their symptoms due to the pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, several important factors need to be considered: 1. Infection rate: The number of new COVID-19 infections directly influences the number of hospitalizations. Monitoring infection rates and trends is crucial for predicting hospital capacity needs. 2. Transmission dynamics: Understanding the transmission patterns of COVID-19, including the incubation period, average time from infection to hospitalization, and the effectiveness of public health measures in controlling transmission, is essential for forecasting hospitalizations accurately. 3. Vaccination rates: The percentage of the population vaccinated against COVID-19 significantly impacts hospitalization rates. Higher vaccination rates generally lead to lower hospitalization rates, especially for severe cases. 4. Severity of cases: The proportion of COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization varies and depends on various factors, including the prevalence of underlying health conditions and the virulence of circulating strains. 5. Healthcare system capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units, and healthcare staff impacts the ability to accommodate COVID-19 patients. Limited capacity can lead to higher hospitalization rates and vice versa. 6. Testing and contact tracing: Effective testing and contact tracing strategies can help identify and isolate infected individuals, reducing the spread and, consequently, hospitalizations. 7. Public health measures: Compliance with public health measures, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and travel restrictions, significantly impacts infection rates and hospitalizations. Relaxing or tightening these measures will have corresponding effects on forecasts. 8. Seasonal variations: COVID-19 hospitalizations may exhibit seasonal variations, with potential increases during winter months when respiratory infections are typically more prevalent. 9. Emergence of new variants: The emergence and spread of new COVID-19 variants can significantly impact hospitalization rates due to their increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines or treatments. 10. Healthcare-seeking behavior: Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, such as delayed medical care or increased reliance on telemedicine, can also influence hospitalization rates and should be considered in forecasts. By incorporating these factors into forecasting models and continuously monitoring their dynamics, public health officials and healthcare administrators can better predict COVID-19 hospitalization needs and allocate resources accordingly.
