Title: Canada’s hospital capacity crisis will remain long after the pandemic is over
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses potential solutions to address hospital capacity issues in Canada, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the concept of bundled payments, which involves paying hospitals and healthcare providers a fixed amount for each patient, regardless of the specific treatments they receive. This approach aims to incentivize more efficient care and reduce costs.
The article also mentions Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the US, which document and analyze patient outcomes to improve care and contain costs.
Experts interviewed in the article suggest that Canada's healthcare system could benefit from a funding model that ties hospital budgets to patient outcomes. They point out that data-driven approaches can help identify areas for improvement and optimize resource allocation.
The article also touches on the importance of performance indicators and data collection in Canadian healthcare, highlighting the lack of such metrics in many jurisdictions.
Some specific ideas proposed by experts include:
1. Implementing bundled payments at a national or provincial level to incentivize more efficient care.
2. Tying hospital budgets to patient outcomes, allowing hospitals to focus on delivering high-quality care while managing costs.
3. Improving data collection and analysis to identify areas for improvement and optimize resource allocation.
4. Leveraging existing data, such as nationally available statistics on average length of hospital stay, to inform decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
The article concludes by emphasizing the need for leaders in Canadian healthcare to take action and adopt more innovative approaches to addressing capacity issues and improving care quality.

"I push this all the time. It's whether I can get people to listen."
