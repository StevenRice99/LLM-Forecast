Title: COVID-19 and the employment of health care workers
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: Health care workers are vital to Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 89.2% of them having jobs that typically involve close contact with others. From March to May 2020, registered nurses (27.4%) and physicians (11.8%) made up a significant portion of health care workers, and the majority of these workers were women. During this period, on average, most health care workers were employed in hospitals (53.4%), followed by ambulatory health care services (26.8%) and nursing/residential care facilities (19.7%). There was a decline of 72,100 health care workers from February to May 2020, mainly due to job losses in ambulatory health care services. However, the number of registered nurses remained stable. The COVID-19 crisis has also led to a significant number of Canadians remaining employed but working reduced hours. On average, 284,300 health care workers worked less than half their usual hours due to COVID-19-related reasons during the March-May period, with ambulatory health care services being the most affected. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the capacity of hospitals and the availability of health care workers. The data suggests that hospitals have been relatively stable in terms of employment, but the impact of reduced hours for health care workers could affect hospital operations. Additionally, the concentration of health care workers in certain regions and the potential for future waves of the pandemic may influence hospitalization rates.

Here is a summary of the article: The Canadian Red Cross has been actively supporting First Nation communities in Manitoba since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. They have provided various forms of assistance, often at the request of the First Nations communities or in collaboration with the Manitoba government. This includes: Vaccination support: providing vaccinators and site support for clinics in First Nation communities. Isolation supplies: distributing isolation kits and self-isolation centre supplies to communities. Outbreak support: sending teams to provide outbreak support and assistance to First Nation communities impacted by COVID-19. Lodging and essential items: helping community members who cannot self-isolate by providing lodging, transportation, food, and other essentials. Healthcare support: offering training on PPE use and disease transmission prevention to health responders and community leaders; providing teams of nurses to support hospital staff; and assisting long-term care homes with additional personnel and PPE organization and delivery. Contact tracing: working with the Manitoba government to conduct contact tracing and provide regular check-ins for those affected by COVID-19. Psychological support: offering free Psychological First Aid training to First Nations members to promote self-care and caring for others. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the Red Cross's efforts in vaccination support and outbreak management within First Nation communities could contribute to important data and insights. Their work in contact tracing and hospital support also provides valuable information on infection rates and healthcare system capacity. Overall, the Canadian Red Cross's comprehensive support for First Nation communities in Manitoba strengthens the collective response to the pandemic and helps lay the foundation for effective COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting.

Title: Simulating the Potential Impacts of the COVID-19 School Closures on Schooling and Learning Outcomes: A set of Global Estimates
Publisher: World Bank Group
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the impact of school closures due to COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn on schooling and learning. The key points are: School closures during the pandemic have disrupted the education of over a billion students worldwide. Governments are trying to mitigate the impact with remote learning and other measures, but the effectiveness varies. At the same time, the economic contractions due to the pandemic are reducing education budgets and household incomes, further impacting the education sector. The paper simulates different scenarios based on the length of school closures and the effectiveness of mitigation measures, resulting in optimistic, intermediate, and pessimistic global outcomes. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, several critical factors need to be considered: Length of School Closures: The simulations in the paper consider closures of 3, 5, and 7 months. Longer closures are likely to have more significant negative effects on both schooling attainment and learning outcomes. Effectiveness of Mitigation: The effectiveness of remote learning and other alternative education methods during school closures plays a crucial role. Ineffective or insufficient mitigation strategies can lead to learning losses and higher dropout rates. Economic Factors: The economic downturn caused by the pandemic can reduce education budgets and impact household incomes, limiting access to education and educational resources. Healthcare System Capacity: The capacity and strain on healthcare systems can also impact hospitalization rates. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and staffing levels may result in higher hospitalization numbers as severe cases may require hospitalization. Vaccination and Booster Rates: The vaccination status of the population, including booster uptake, influences hospitalization forecasts. Higher vaccination coverage generally leads to lower hospitalization rates, especially for severe cases. Virus Variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can significantly impact hospitalization forecasts. Some variants may be more transmissible or cause more severe disease, leading to increased hospitalizations. Adherence to Public Health Measures: The effectiveness of public health measures such as masking, social distancing, and contact tracing also plays a role in hospitalization forecasts. Lax adherence may result in higher transmission rates and subsequent hospitalizations. In conclusion, accurate forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations considers not only the direct impact of the virus but also the indirect consequences, such as school closures and their mitigation strategies. By analyzing various scenarios and considering economic, social, and healthcare factors, public health officials and policymakers can make informed decisions to optimize resource allocation and minimize the impact of the pandemic on health and education systems.

Title: One country, two pandemics: what COVID-19 reveals about inequality in Canada
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities in Canadian society, particularly in low-income and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Data from Montreal and Toronto showed higher rates of infection and death in these areas, attributed to working conditions and living situations that increase exposure to the virus. Similar trends were observed in long-term care centres, prisons, and other congregate settings, highlighting the heightened vulnerability of marginalized communities. The federal government's modelling revealed that women made up 57% of infections, and the economic impact has disproportionately affected younger, low-wage, and non-unionized workers, especially in public-facing sectors. The pandemic has also brought to light the essential yet undervalued work of frontline workers, who often face increased risks with limited protection. While the collective effort to curb the virus's spread has saved lives, it has also revealed the pre-existing inequalities and the need for long-term solutions. As Canada reopens, the sense of solidarity is waning, and the focus has shifted to individual behaviour and compliance with health measures. The protests against systemic racism have underscored the message that a society's strength depends on its most vulnerable members. The challenges ahead lie in addressing the inequalities and making systemic changes to create a more equitable and resilient society, beyond the immediate crisis response.
