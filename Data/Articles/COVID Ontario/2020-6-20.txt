The virus can survive in the digestive tract and be present in stool.
Aerosol particles from flushing toilets can spread infectious particles up to 1.07 meters high, including over toilet seats and bathroom floors.
Particles can continue to spread through the air for an extended period after the initial flush (up to 70 seconds).
The virus remains viable in the air for three hours and on surfaces like stainless steel and plastics for up to 72 hours.
These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that toilet hygiene can contribute to transmission of the virus.
