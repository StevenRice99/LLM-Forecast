Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A panel reviewing Alberta's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has released a report with over 90 recommendations to improve the province's preparedness for future crises. The core suggestion is that the province's premier and cabinet, aided by a senior science officer, lead the response to province-wide emergencies. The report also recommends increasing the capacity of Alberta's healthcare system and protecting the rights and freedoms of Albertans during public emergencies. However, critics argue that the report prioritizes individual rights over public health and could make it difficult for the government to protect hospital capacity and vulnerable populations. The panel's chair, Preston Manning, encourages Albertans to read the full report and provide feedback. Manning has been critical of government-imposed health restrictions during the pandemic.

Here is a summary of the article: New Brunswick is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations, with a child under four being among the 52 people hospitalized for or with the virus. The province's "excess mortality" or "untimely mortality" is expected to increase by 20% in the coming weeks, according to infectious diseases researcher Tara Moriarty. Hospitalizations are costing the province an estimated $1 million per day, and the number of people in intensive care has increased. Moriarty estimates that about one in 30 New Brunswickers are currently infected with COVID-19, and recommends that people get the updated COVID-19 vaccine and follow precautions such as wearing well-fitted masks indoors and avoiding non-essential indoor gatherings. There have been 11 lab-confirmed COVID outbreaks in nursing homes and other facilities, and "a lot" of infections are being contracted in hospitals or healthcare settings. The Horizon Health Network has seen a 36% decrease in hospitalized COVID patients compared to the previous week, but the number of people in intensive care remains high. There are also COVID outbreaks in several hospitals in the province. The article also mentions that four new cases of the flu have been confirmed, and 112,695 people have been vaccinated for influenza since October 4. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the current hospitalization numbers, the positivity rate, and the estimated number of people infected. The high number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, as well as the expected increase in "excess mortality", suggest that the situation in New Brunswick is severe and could worsen in the coming weeks.

Here is a summary of the article: This article examines the higher proportion of female COVID-19 deaths in Canada compared to the global trend of higher male deaths. It explores the potential factors contributing to this discrepancy, including age, long-term care facility residency, and immigration status. The study utilizes data from the COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker and links it to immigration and health databases in Canada. Key findings include: Initially, there were more female COVID-19 deaths in Canada, particularly among non-immigrants aged 85 and older. COVID-19 death rates were higher for males across all age groups, except for non-immigrants aged 85 and older. Among immigrants, male health and social assistance workers had a higher death rate than females in the same sector. The overrepresentation of female COVID-19 deaths ceased in the summer of 2021, following vaccinations in long-term care facilities. The study highlights the importance of considering age and immigration status when analyzing COVID-19 mortality rates. The higher female death rate was likely due to the high concentration of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities, where immigrant institutionalization rates were lower. The findings contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19's impact on different population segments. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors could be considered: Age: Older individuals, especially those in long-term care facilities, are more vulnerable to severe outcomes. Immigration status: Immigrants may have different access to healthcare and living conditions, impacting their risk. Vaccination status: Vaccination campaigns, especially in vulnerable populations, have been effective in reducing severe outcomes. Healthcare capacity: The availability of healthcare resources can influence hospitalization rates. Variant prevalence: New variants can impact transmissibility and severity, affecting hospitalization forecasts. By considering these factors and analyzing data trends, forecasts can help prepare healthcare systems and guide public health policies.

Title: Alberta COVID-19 panel urges consideration of 'alternative' scientific theories
Publisher: CTV News Edmonton
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
A panel led by former Reform Party leader Preston Manning has released a report with recommendations on how Alberta can better prepare for future pandemics. The panel urges the province to consider "alternative" scientific theories and a more "balanced response" to emergencies, with the premier and cabinet having the final say in any crisis response. The report has sparked controversy, with the NDP arguing that it opens the door to fringe ideas and conspiracy theories. Premier Danielle Smith, who has previously advocated for debunked COVID-19 treatments, stated that no decisions have been made in response to the recommendations. The panel's suggestions include amending rules to better organize decision-making in a crisis and protecting personal freedoms during emergencies. However, critics are concerned about centralizing power in the hands of the government and the potential for an ideologically driven response to public health emergencies. The report also emphasizes the need to consider the economic, social, educational, and legal impacts of response measures, recommending a multidisciplinary approach to scientific advice. This invitation to consider "alternative" theories has worried some experts who fear a partisan or ideological approach to managing communicable diseases.

Title: Evaluation of pragmatic oxygenation measurement as a proxy for Covid-19 severity
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article proposes a new method for assessing pulmonary oxygenation function in patients with COVID-19, called the $S/F$ ratio, which is calculated by dividing the patient's $S p O 2$ (oxygen saturation) by the $F I O 2$ (fraction of inspired oxygen). The $S/F$ ratio is suggested as a potential intermediate endpoint for clinical trials aimed at reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The article evaluates the predictive validity of the $S/F$ ratio compared to other measures of oxygenation function, such as the $P/F$ ratio, A-a gradient, and effective shunt fraction. The results show that the $S/F$ ratio is a good predictor of $P a O 2$ after a change in $F I O 2$, indicating its potential usefulness in assessing pulmonary oxygenation function. The article then focuses on a subset of patients from the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study in the UK, aged 20-75, who required supplementary oxygen therapy within 3 days of hospital admission. The $S/F$ ratio is calculated at baseline and on days 5 and 8 from enrollment. The association between $S/F$ ratio and 28-day mortality is evaluated using logistic regression, assuming that pulmonary oxygenation function predicts mortality and that $S/F$ ratio accurately reflects this function. The article also includes sample size calculations for different outcome measures, including the $S/F$ ratio, WHO ordinal scale, sustained improvement at day 28, and 28-day mortality. The calculations assume an 80% power at a two-sided p-value of 0.05 to detect a 15% relative reduction in mortality. In summary, the article proposes a new method for assessing pulmonary oxygenation function in COVID-19 patients, the $S/F$ ratio, which may be useful as an intermediate endpoint in clinical trials. The evaluation of predictive validity and the association with mortality suggest that the $S/F$ ratio has potential clinical usefulness. The sample size calculations provide guidance for future clinical trial design.

Title: Rising COVID-19 numbers reported in Ottawa, eastern Ontario
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ottawa's COVID-19 numbers are rising, with individual trends categorized as high or very high. There is a high level of RSV activity, while flu numbers vary. Wastewater data shows rising coronavirus levels, indicating a potential increase in COVID-19 cases. The average number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa has risen to 71, with one patient in the ICU. The weekly test positivity rate in Ottawa remains high at 19%. There has been an increase in active COVID-19 outbreaks to 37, mostly in retirement homes and hospitals. The Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) is also experiencing a rise in COVID-19 cases, with high wastewater readings and a high test positivity rate of 23%. The Kingston area health unit reports 22 active COVID-19 patients in hospitals, while the EOHU has seen a threefold increase to 25 hospitalizations. Western Quebec's COVID-19 hospitalizations remain stable at 85, and they reported 8 additional deaths in the last week. Leeds, Grenville, and Lanark counties reported two more COVID-19 deaths. Based on these developments, it appears that COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising in Ottawa and the surrounding region. The high wastewater readings and test positivity rates suggest that COVID-19 transmission is increasing, which may lead to more hospitalizations in the coming weeks. It is important for individuals to continue following public health recommendations, such as getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing masks, and staying home when sick, to help mitigate the impact of the virus on the healthcare system.

Title: How Long Will COVID-19 Survive on Surfaces?
Publisher: Health Essentials
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the importance of protecting oneself from viruses like the common cold, flu, and COVID-19 by getting vaccinated, washing hands, avoiding sick individuals, and cleaning surfaces. It explains that viruses like COVID-19 do not survive well on surfaces and typically die off quickly if not transferred to a new host. The survival time of COVID-19 on surfaces varies depending on the type of surface, with hard, non-porous surfaces allowing the virus to live longer than softer materials. Factors like cleanliness, temperature, humidity, and sunlight also affect how long the virus can survive on surfaces. While the virus may be detectable on surfaces for several days, the amount of live virus decreases over time, reducing the risk of infection from touching contaminated surfaces. Despite the short shelf-life of COVID-19 on surfaces, it is still important to practice good hygiene, clean and sanitize frequently touched surfaces, and take precautions to prevent virus transmission, such as getting vaccinated and washing hands regularly.

Masking requirements for staff have been reinstated in long-term care facilities in Ontario due to an increase in COVID-19 cases and outbreaks. The new rules took effect on November 7 and apply to staff, volunteers, and support workers, who must wear masks indoors in all resident areas. The Public Health Ontario report, published on the same day as the new masking rules, indicates a high positivity rate for COVID-19 of about 17% in the province, which is higher than the positivity rate for influenza or RSV. Cases have also increased, with Ontario recording approximately 20.5 cases per 100,000 people in the last week of October, up from 12 cases per 100,000 in the first full week of September. Wastewater surveillance data also suggests a slow increase in COVID-19 cases as of November 9. The report also highlights the impact of COVID-19 on long-term care and retirement homes. In long-term care homes, there were 7,157 cases among residents and staff in 2023, with 181 resident hospitalizations and 106 deaths. Retirement homes saw 3,884 cases, 172 hospitalizations, and 21 deaths. Additionally, there was a significant increase in respiratory virus outbreaks in long-term care homes in September and October. To protect the healthcare system and manage COVID-19 cases, a new COVID-19 vaccine targeting the XXB variant is now available to individuals over six months old. Dr. Fahad Razak, an internist, emphasizes the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. With the uptick in cases and outbreaks, the reinstatement of masking requirements and the availability of new vaccines aim to curb the spread and protect vulnerable populations in long-term care settings.
