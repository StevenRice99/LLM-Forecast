Title: COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy Is Safe, Has Multiple Benefits
Publisher: FactCheck.org
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the effectiveness of maternal COVID-19 vaccination in reducing the risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 in infants, particularly during the first six months of life.
According to multiple studies, including one published in JAMA Pediatrics by Jorgensen et al., babies whose mothers had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy had a 45% lower risk of infection and 53% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron compared to babies of unvaccinated mothers. The protection was even better if the mothers got at least one dose during the third trimester, with a 73% lower risk of infection and an 80% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron.
The article also notes that while maternal vaccination is associated with reduced risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 in infants, it does not eliminate the need for infant vaccination. The CDC recommends that all children aged 6 months and older receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
Overall, the article provides an accurate summary of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of maternal COVID-19 vaccination in reducing the risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 in infants.
