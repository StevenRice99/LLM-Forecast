Title: JN.1, the WHO’s newest ‘variant of interest,’ has spiked COVID wastewater levels to all-time highs in some countries. What you need to know about the ‘Pirola’ offshoot
Publisher: Fortune
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses a new COVID-19 variant, JN.1, which has been declared a "variant of interest" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The variant has been spreading rapidly in some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark, and has been linked to increased hospitalizations in some areas, such as New York City. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: JN.1 is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant, which was known for its high number of mutations and ability to evade immunity. JN.1 has an additional mutation, L455S, which boosts its ability to evade antibodies from prior infection and vaccination. The variant is spreading rapidly, with a doubling time of around two weeks, although sequencing of COVID viral samples is at a near all-time low, making it difficult to determine the exact spread. Hospitalizations are rising in some areas, such as New York City, although it is unclear if this is solely due to JN.1 or other factors such as waning population immunity. COVID vaccines are thought to provide good protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from JN.1, although experts caution that the variant's increased immune evasion could lead to increased hospitalizations. Experts recommend continued vigilance, including wearing effective respirators in public spaces and taking reasonable precautions during the respiratory virus season. Overall, the article suggests that JN.1 has the potential to contribute to increased hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, although the exact impact is uncertain and will depend on various factors, including the spread of the variant, population immunity, and public health measures.

Title: Coronavirus subvariant JN.1 growing fast in US, already dominant in the Northeast
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here's a brief summary highlighting the most important values: The JN.1 subvariant, a descendant of BA.2.86, is rapidly spreading globally and has already become dominant in the Northeast US, causing about 20% of new COVID-19 infections. JN.1 has a mutation that helps it escape immunity, leading to a twofold decrease in antibody neutralization. Several countries, including Canada, have seen exponential growth of JN.1 and rising hospitalizations. Waning immunity due to low vaccination rates is contributing to the spread of JN.1. The current COVID-19 vaccine offers good protection against JN.1, but vaccination rates are low, with only 18% of adults having received the latest vaccine in the US. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 have risen 51% in the past four weeks, and continued increases could strain hospital capacity. These values suggest that the spread of JN.1 could lead to an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, especially if vaccination rates remain low.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: The Public Health Agency of Canada reports a slight increase in the number of beds occupied by patients in hospital as a result of COVID-19, from 4,679 to 4,687, for the week ending Dec. 12. The number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU remained the same at 159. Influenza activity is rising in Canada, with widespread flu activity in Alberta and parts of B.C. Adults 65 and older and children under five have the highest cumulative hospitalization rates for flu in Canada. Nearly 12% of adults report developing long-term symptoms after a COVID-19 infection. Flu shots and COVID-19 boosters are available across the country, including in Ontario. These points suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario may be influenced by the rising influenza activity, the availability of flu shots and COVID-19 boosters, and the ongoing circulation of the COVID-19 virus. The data on hospitalizations and ICU admissions can inform forecasting models, while the information on long-term symptoms and vaccination efforts can provide context for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on hospitalizations.
