COVID activity in Ontario is "high" overall and increasing (Health Canada)
Public Health recommends wearing a multi-layer well-fitting mask to reduce COVID-19 transmission
Good ventilation can help reduce COVID-19 transmission by creating a cross-breeze of fresh air and improving air quality
Air purifiers with HEPA filters may add an additional layer of protection against COVID-19
CO2 monitors can indicate if there isn't enough ventilation in a space, but high or increasing levels don't necessarily mean low transmission risk

A summary relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada is:
COVID-19 hospitalization forecast: LOW RISK. JN.1 variant may cause an increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases due to a surge of respiratory infections during winter season. Symptoms are typical (dry cough, headache, fever, fatigue) and not more severe than previous variants, such as Omicron BA.2. Ontario is among the countries reporting JN.1 sequences (6.8% of total).

Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
COVID rates in Ottawa remain generally stable but very high (approx. 73 average hospital patients per week).
Wastewater levels have been rising for about five months and are considered very high.
Test positivity rate in Ottawa is around 16% (very high).
There were 251 new COVID cases reported in the last week, with a very high number of new outbreaks (33 active outbreaks).
Hospitalizations are also increasing in other regions, such as Kingston (28 patients), Hastings Prince Edward (23 patients), and Western Quebec (83 patients).

Respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, are circulating at the same time as common cold and cough viruses.
Certain groups, such as older adults, pregnant persons, young children, and people with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk of severe illness and complications.
Public health precautions, such as vaccination (COVID-19 and flu), handwashing, and wearing a well-fitted mask, are recommended to reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses.
The frequency of severe illness and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 is being monitored by public health units in Ontario.

Title: JN.1, the WHO’s newest ‘variant of interest,’ has spiked COVID wastewater levels to all-time highs in some countries. What you need to know about the ‘Pirola’ offshoot
Publisher: Fortune

The article discusses the origin and evolution of JN.1, a newly emerged variant of COVID-19. Here's a summary:
Scientists believe that JN.1 evolved from BA.2.86, which was a highly mutated variant that circulated in a single host with a long-term infection.
The virus likely "holed up" in the GI system, making it difficult to detect through traditional PCR tests.
When the variant spilled back into the population, it began to refine its ability to spread and evade immunity.
JN.1 is notable for acquiring the L455S mutation, which boosts its ability to evade antibodies from prior infection and vaccination.
The article also discusses the potential future of JN.1:
Like BA.2.86, JN.1 will continue to evolve through a process of parallel evolution, potentially acquiring new mutations that make it more troubling.
Some experts believe that JN.1 could be the start of a new era in the pandemic, with many possible descendants emerging from this variant.
Public health officials cannot rely solely on current COVID landscape when planning for the future, as "weird, one-off things" can always come back.
Finally, the article mentions the possibility of assigning JN.1 a new nickname, but the variant trackers have decided to refer to it as a member of the Pirola family, rather than giving it its own distinct name.

Title: Coronavirus subvariant JN.1 growing fast in US, already dominant in the Northeast
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
JN.1 is a rapidly spreading subvariant causing about 20% of new COVID-19 infections in the US and growing quickly in Canada.
Prevalence of JN.1 more than doubled in the US between late November and mid-December.
The World Health Organization named JN.1 a variant of interest due to its "rapidly increasing spread".
Studies suggest that there's about a twofold decrease in antibody ability to neutralize this subvariant, which could portend another wave of infections.
In several European countries, exponential growth of JN.1 has been observed along with rising hospitalizations.
COVID-19 hospitalization rates have risen 51% in the US over the past four weeks, straining hospital capacity.
