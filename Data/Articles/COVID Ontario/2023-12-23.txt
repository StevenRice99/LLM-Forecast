Posted: 1 day ago
The abstract of the article discusses the importance of syndromic surveillance for respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and introduces FluWatchers, Canada's syndromic surveillance system. The article examines FluWatchers' performance during the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) data with laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus detections (RVDs). The system relies on volunteers reporting ILI symptoms weekly and has been adapted to include COVID-19-related symptoms and questions. The study analyzes data from March 2020 to March 2023, with a total of 25,326 participants, and compares it with laboratory-confirmed RVD data. The results show a correlation between self-reported ILI/ARI and RVDs, providing insights into the prevalence and trends of respiratory viruses during the pandemic.

The Peterborough, Ontario region has seen eight consecutive weeks of high community risk for COVID-19, according to the local public health department. While some indicators remain unchanged, the positive rapid antigen tests indicator has dropped from "low" to "very low." There are currently 219 active PCR-confirmed cases, with 124 new cases reported since the last update. Four new deaths have been reported in the past week, bringing the total to 172 since the pandemic began. Hospitalizations have decreased to 15 inpatients with COVID-19, and the seven-day rolling average is 19 patients. There are currently nine active outbreaks in the region, with three new outbreaks since the last report. The health unit is reporting approximately 82% of residents have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 27,000 doses have been administered since September 14, 2023. To help forecast hospitalizations, it is important to monitor the indicators such as PCR test positivity, wastewater surveillance, case rate, and outbreaks. The high levels in these indicators suggest that hospitalizations may increase or remain stable in the near future.

Title: COVID test supplier received billions in pandemic contracts after submitting edited results
Publisher: Global News

Posted: 2 days ago
A Global News investigation has revealed that BTNX, a small rapid test supplier based outside Toronto, secured an estimated $2 billion in federal contracts in 2021 and 2022 by providing regulators with incomplete data about its product’s accuracy. BTNX deleted dozens of specimens from a study submitted to Health Canada, making its test appear more reliable and sensitive than it actually was. The test was found to be less dependable in detecting COVID-19 in users who were not highly contagious, leading to concerns about false-negative results and potential risks to Canadian lives. Experts have criticized BTNX's actions as "unethical" and "dangerous," calling for accountability and transparency from both the company and the Canadian government. Despite these revelations, BTNX and Health Canada defend their positions, with BTNX threatening legal action against Global News. The investigation raises questions about the accuracy of rapid tests and the government's role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices during the pandemic.

Vitamin D is important for bone health and has potential immune-modulating effects, which may protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce COVID-19 severity. Vitamin D deficiency is common, especially among groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19, such as Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals, older adults, and those with obesity and hypertension. While observational studies suggest a link between low vitamin D levels and worse COVID-19 outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D supplementation for prevention or treatment. A Mexican trial found a lower risk of infection with vitamin D supplementation in unvaccinated healthcare workers, but it had a high dropout rate. Brazilian and Argentinian trials showed no significant improvement in hospital stay, ICU admission, ventilation needs, or mortality with vitamin D treatment in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A French trial suggested a reduced mortality rate at 14 days with a high dose of vitamin D but not at 28 days. More well-designed, randomized, and controlled trials are needed to establish the role of vitamin D in COVID-19 prevention and treatment.

Title: Left behind: inequalities in the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents in the WHO European Region: impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people’s health and well-being from th
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)

The article summarizes a survey conducted in 22 countries/regions in the WHO European Region, examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' health and behaviors. The survey found that girls and 15-year-olds were more likely to report negative impacts on their health and mental health compared to boys and younger adolescents. Social inequalities, such as family economic status, unemployment, and single-parent households, were also linked to negative pandemic impacts in many countries. Additionally, having a family member hospitalized due to COVID-19 was a significant risk factor for negative health outcomes in over half of the countries/regions. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions in times of crisis, as the impact of risk factors varied across countries/regions. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: An important factor to consider is the hospitalization of a family member due to COVID-19, which was a significant risk factor for negative health outcomes in a large number of countries/regions. This suggests that regions with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations may experience a greater negative impact on adolescent health and well-being. Additionally, the presence of social inequalities exacerbates the negative impact of the pandemic on adolescents, which could further influence hospitalization rates.

New Brunswick reported two additional deaths related to COVID-19 and an increase in hospitalizations and nursing home outbreaks due to the virus. The province also saw a rise in flu cases and hospitalizations, with 37 people hospitalized for the flu in the last week, a nearly 147% increase. The Green Party health critic, Megan Mitton, has called for a public inquiry into the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, citing the province's high death rate. The auditor general's review of the pandemic response found that the Department of Health lacked evidence-based documentation for key Public Health decisions. COVID-19 activity remains moderate, but hospitalizations and outbreaks have increased. Horizon Health Network, one of the province's two health authorities, reported a 67% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations compared to the previous week.

Here is a summary of the article: Canada is currently experiencing respiratory virus season, with influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 circulating simultaneously. The Chief Public Health Officer has stated that this is posing challenges to hospitals in some areas. Influenza activity is rising in Canada, particularly in Alberta and parts of British Columbia. A report from Statistics Canada also highlights that 12% of adults who had COVID-19 developed long-term symptoms. To protect against flu and COVID-19, flu shot programs are being rolled out across Canada for anyone over six months old. COVID-19 booster vaccines are also available and protect against the XBB.1.5 subvariant. The majority of flu cases in Canada are influenza A (H1N1 subtype), with the highest hospitalization rates among adults over 65 and children under five. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have slightly increased, while the number of patients in the ICU remains unchanged. Health Canada advises following testing guidelines if individuals experience symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19, and to isolate if they test positive. To protect against respiratory viruses, Health Canada recommends wearing masks, regular handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, disinfecting surfaces, and staying home when sick. Overall, Canada is facing a challenging respiratory virus season with co-circulation of multiple viruses. Health authorities are encouraging individuals to get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, and to follow public health guidelines to reduce the impact on hospitals and protect vulnerable individuals.

Here are the key medical stories that the CBC health and science reporters will be monitoring in 2024: The crisis in healthcare and how to resolve it: Canada's healthcare system is facing significant challenges, including a shortage of family doctors, a lack of hospital beds, a shortfall of nurses, and lengthy waitlists for non-life-threatening surgeries. While provinces are implementing changes, experts doubt that these measures will adequately address the issues. The federal government is collecting more data from provinces to identify effective solutions. The ripple effects of record-breaking heat: Climate change is expected to cause a surge in heat-related deaths, food insecurity, and infectious diseases by mid-century if global warming exceeds 1.5 C. Bangladesh's dengue outbreak and the Horn of Africa's acute food shortage due to drought and extreme rain illustrate the current impacts. A transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is emphasized as urgent. The rise of drug-resistant infections: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing concern, with an estimated 5,400 deaths in Canada annually. By 2050, AMR is projected to claim 256,000 lives in the country if no changes are made. Surveillance, hand hygiene, and the search for new antibiotics are among the strategies to combat AMR. The toxic and evolving drug supply: Canada's toxic drug crisis is worsening, with the number of deaths and hospitalizations from opioid-related poisonings reaching record highs. There are debates over the best approach to address the crisis, including harm reduction sites and treatment centers. The spread of xylazine, a potentially deadly additive, is a growing concern. The promise of gene-editing: The U.K. and U.S. have approved the first gene-editing therapy using CRISPR for treating blood disorders sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. The treatment is costly and requires extended hospital stays, but it offers a potential cure and improved quality of life for patients. Canada's response to this technology is awaited. The booming business of weight loss drugs: Ozempic, a diabetes drug repurposed for weight loss, has seen surging demand in Canada, leading to supply shortages. Wegovy, a similar drug, is approved for weight loss but not yet available. Side effects and potential risks, such as abdominal pain and suicidal thoughts, are being monitored. The risks of pathogens spreading from animals to humans: The mpox outbreak in 2022 highlighted the threat of animal-borne pathogens jumping to humans. While the outbreak subsided, the virus is likely endemic. The ongoing avian influenza outbreak affecting birds and mammals raises concerns about its potential to adapt to human-to-human transmission. Global surveillance and sampling are crucial to detect and prevent the next pandemic.
