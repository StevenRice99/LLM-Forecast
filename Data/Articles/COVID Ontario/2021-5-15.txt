India, which successfully handled the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, is now facing record numbers of new cases that have overwhelmed its healthcare system. UVic political scientist Reeta Tremblay discussed the political and social dynamics at play, attributing the current crisis to complacency on the part of the Indian government and citizens. She noted that the government did not plan for the second wave, failed to secure vaccine supplies, and allowed gatherings without social distancing or masks. The government's insistence on campaigning unhindered during elections also contributed to the spread. Tremblay also addressed accusations that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prioritized politics over public health, and highlighted the Canadian and international responses to the crisis, including the supply of medical equipment and support for waiving intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines. She concluded that India's initial success in handling the first wave led to complacency, resulting in the current dire situation.

Title: What happens when people get two different COVID-19 vaccines?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Some Canadian health officials and experts are considering the possibility of mixing different COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for those who have already received the AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns about rare side effects. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has stated that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not the "preferred" option due to its association with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), a rare blood clotting condition. The frequency of VITT is estimated to be between 1 in 26,000 and 1 in 127,000 doses. As a result, some provinces are considering pausing AstraZeneca vaccinations. Researchers at Oxford University are conducting the COVID-19 Heterologous Prime Boost study ("Com-COV") to investigate the effects of mixing different types of vaccines, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The study aims to determine if receiving two different vaccines can generate an equal or better immune response compared to receiving the same vaccine twice. Early results from the study are expected soon. According to Dr. Helen Fletcher, a professor of immunology, mixing vaccines could potentially lead to a stronger and broader immune response, including against virus variants. She also notes that combining different vaccine types has been done safely for decades for other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Canadian officials are reviewing the Oxford research, and Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has stated that evolving science will guide the advice on second doses. Regarding the availability of mRNA doses for a mix-and-match program, Canada has received millions of doses from Pfizer and Moderna, with more expected in the coming months. However, provinces may need to allocate some of these doses for second shots for AstraZeneca recipients. Maj. Gen. Dany Fortin, leading vaccine logistics, assures that planning for second doses is underway, and provinces are keeping track of who has received which vaccine. Finally, the article mentions the possibility of Canada shortening the time between shots as more vaccines become available, contrary to NACI's previous guidance of waiting up to 16 weeks between doses due to supply constraints. Ontario has already announced that it will begin offering second doses to high-risk groups this week.

Title: Coronavirus Recovery: Breathing Exercises
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article offers a series of breathing exercises to aid in the recovery of lung function for those who have had COVID-19, focusing on deep breathing techniques to restore diaphragm function and increase lung capacity. Here's a summary: Breathing Exercises for COVID-19 Recovery: Benefits of Deep Breathing: Deep breathing exercises restore diaphragm function and increase lung capacity. They reduce feelings of anxiety and stress, common issues post-COVID-19. Sleep quality may also improve. Precautions: Do not start exercises and consult a doctor if experiencing a fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or new leg swelling. Stop the exercises if you develop dizziness, unusual shortness of breath, chest pain, clammy skin, excessive fatigue, or an irregular heartbeat. Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing): Phase 1: Lie on your back with bent knees, placing hands on your stomach. Breathe in through the nose, expanding your stomach. Slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat for 1 minute. Phase 2: Lie on your stomach, resting your head on your hands. Breathe in through the nose, focusing on pushing your stomach into the mattress. Slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat for 1 minute. Phase 3: Sit upright and place hands on the sides of the stomach. Breathe in through the nose, pulling air into the stomach. Slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat for 1 minute. Phase 4: Stand upright and place hands on the sides of the stomach. Follow the same breathing technique as Phase 3. You may also practice humming during exhalation. Additional Exercises: Yawn to a Smile: Sit upright, reach arms overhead, and yawn, then bring arms down and smile for 3 seconds. This increases arm and shoulder strength and opens the chest for better diaphragm movement. Humming: Humming during exhalation increases nitric oxide, aiding the nervous system and oxygen delivery. It's also calming and stress-reducing. These exercises can aid in COVID-19 recovery by improving lung function and mental well-being. They can be started at home during self-isolation, helping to gradually restore respiratory health. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, while the exercises can aid in recovery, they are targeted at those who are already recovering from the disease and do not directly provide data for forecasting hospitalizations. However, the overall benefit to lung health and the potential reduction in severe symptoms could indirectly impact hospitalization rates, especially for those at high risk of respiratory complications.

Title: COVID-19 is not influenza, but it offers lessons on beating it, say Concordia researchers
Publisher: Concordia University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, which reveals a correlation between COVID-19 mitigation practices and the dramatic decline in influenza cases. The study, authored by Concordia researchers and colleagues, examined 2020 influenza data from Canada, the US, Australia, and Brazil. The findings suggest that preventive measures such as hand washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing not only curbed COVID-19 cases but also virtually eradicated the flu, despite the surge in COVID-19 infections. This indicates that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than the flu. The lead author, Jovana Stojanovic, emphasizes the impact of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on influenza, providing valuable insights into the comparative contagiousness of the two respiratory illnesses. This information could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as it highlights the effectiveness of preventive measures in curbing the spread of highly contagious respiratory illnesses.

UBC researchers are at the forefront of efforts to improve care for patients with COVID-19, developing new tools and approaches to better manage the disease and its impact on the healthcare system. One key area of focus is forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, which is crucial for healthcare planning and resource allocation. UBC researchers have developed advanced modeling tools that take into account various factors such as vaccination rates, new variants, and changing public health measures to predict hospitalizations. This helps healthcare administrators make informed decisions about staffing, bed capacity, and other resources needed to care for COVID-19 patients. The UBC team, led by Dr. Mahsa Gholami, has developed a machine-learning model called COvid-19 Hospitalization Forecasts (COHORT). This model uses data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and key public health indicators to generate short-term forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations. COHORT has been successfully used in British Columbia and is now being adapted for use in other provinces and territories across Canada. Another important aspect of UBC's research is the development of tools to predict the severity of COVID-19 cases. By identifying high-risk patients early on, healthcare providers can provide more targeted and efficient care. UBC researchers have created a risk score system, called the UBC COVID-19 Severity Index, which uses easily accessible patient data to predict the likelihood of severe outcomes. This tool has been validated in multiple settings and helps guide clinical decision-making. In addition, UBC researchers are also exploring the long-term effects of COVID-19, known as long COVID, and developing strategies to manage these persistent symptoms. They are investigating the impact of COVID-19 on various organ systems and collaborating with patient partners to understand the patient perspective and develop effective management strategies. The UBC team is also actively involved in knowledge translation, ensuring that their research findings are accessible and actionable for healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. They regularly publish updates and reports, engage with media, and collaborate with stakeholders to drive evidence-based practices and policies. Overall, the innovative research coming out of UBC is helping to improve the care and management of patients with COVID-19 and providing valuable tools and insights to inform the pandemic response in Canada and beyond.

Researchers from the Netherlands and Germany have published a preliminary report on the effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, finding that while it is highly effective in preventing infection, less is known about its broader effects on the immune system. The study confirms the vaccine's ability to induce effective immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, it also alters the immune response to non-specific stimuli, including fungal and bacterial ones. The researchers advise that the complex reprogramming of innate immune responses induced by the vaccine should be considered in its development and use. They also highlight the need for larger cohort studies and further research into the potential interactions with other vaccines. This research provides valuable insights into the vaccine's impact on the immune system, which could help inform COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and the understanding of long-term effects.

Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted international travel, with a 92% decrease in international arrivals to Canada in March 2020. This has shifted Canadian residents' focus to domestic travel, boosting local and regional tourism. While domestic tourism has partially compensated for the loss of international tourists, tourism spending in Canada fell by nearly 50% in 2020. Large Canadian cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, which are usually major tourist destinations, have experienced significant declines in tourism spending. In contrast, several destinations outside major urban centers have benefited from the rise in domestic tourism. However, some regional destinations have struggled to accommodate the influx of visitors without impacting the environment and local residents' quality of life. To manage tourism during the pandemic, governments have implemented strategies such as financial assistance programs for tourism operators and promoting domestic tourism to avoid overcrowding in popular hotspots. As the pandemic continues, additional measures should be considered, such as establishing limits on accommodations for tourists and monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations. Efficient management of tourist flows is critical to balance economic opportunities and the need to control visitor numbers, especially as regions aim to attract new residents and businesses. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The impact of COVID-19 on international travel and the shift to domestic tourism has had both positive and negative effects on Canadian destinations. Large cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have recorded significant economic losses due to the decline in international tourists. Regional destinations have experienced a mixed impact, with some benefiting from the rise in domestic tourism while others struggle to manage the influx of visitors. Efficient management of tourist flows and government support are crucial to mitigate the financial losses in the tourism sector and control the number of visitors to ensure the environment and residents' quality of life are preserved. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations may depend on various factors, including vaccination rates, government restrictions, and adherence to health measures. Promoting safe and responsible domestic tourism can help distribute tourists across destinations and reduce the risk of overcrowding in popular locations, potentially reducing the strain on healthcare resources.
