Title: Ontario nurses call for better pay after redeployed doctor funding shows drastic differences for similar work
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the challenges faced by nurses in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their hard work and dedication, nurses are feeling undervalued and unappreciated, with many experiencing burnout and mental health issues.
The province's "pandemic pay" program, which provided an additional $4 per hour for 16 weeks, has expired, leaving many nurses without financial compensation for their work. The Ontario Nurses' Association (ONA) has called for an exemption from the provincial wage cap of one percent a year, citing the need for higher pay and bonuses to recognize the risks and challenges faced by nurses during the pandemic.
The article highlights the contrast between the government's words of encouragement and the actual support provided to nurses. While the Ministry of Health says it values the contributions of health-care workers, it has not taken concrete steps to address the concerns raised by the ONA.
The situation is compounded by the fact that many nurses are leaving their jobs or working part-time due to burnout and mental health issues. The article quotes an ICU nurse who said she didn't sleep for three weeks after a traumatic experience at work, and others who have had to take leave or reduce their hours.
The ONA has launched a charter challenge against the provincial wage cap law (Bill 124), but it will likely take time for a resolution. In the meantime, nurses are calling on the government to provide financial compensation and an exemption from the wage cap law.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of supporting nurses during National Nursing Week next week.
