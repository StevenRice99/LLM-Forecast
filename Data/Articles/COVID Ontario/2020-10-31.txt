Title: Seven Ways COVID-19 Is Affecting Canadian Housing
Publisher: RBC Thought Leadership -
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the Canadian real estate market, shifting demand from urban to rural and suburban areas as homebuyers seek larger spaces. Here are the key ways COVID-19 has affected the housing market: 1. Peak resale activity shifted from spring to summer due to lockdown measures, resulting in a record-high market in the third quarter. 2. Rental markets in large, unaffordable cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have cooled due to increased supply and financial pressure on renters. 3. Investors are looking to sell condos as rents soften and vacancies rise, particularly in Toronto, where new regulations add to the impulse to sell. 4. City-dwellers are moving to smaller towns and cottage country in search of larger living spaces, impacting real estate markets in these areas. 5. Low-interest rates and government income support programs have made it more affordable for some Canadians to own a home, increasing purchasing power. 6. Immigration, a key driver of housing demand, has been severely disrupted by the pandemic, reducing net migration by 94% in the second quarter of 2020. This could temper rental demand and deplete future cohorts of first-time homebuyers. 7. The pandemic has put financial strain on many homeowners, with almost 780,000 people deferring mortgage payments. This poses a risk to the housing market, particularly in areas with a weak economy, as it could lead to a wave of properties being put up for sale. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Canadian real estate market, shifting demand and creating both opportunities and challenges for homebuyers and investors.

Title: COVID-19 mortality rates in Canada’s ethno-cultural neighbourhoods
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This article examines the impact of COVID-19 on population groups designated as visible minorities in Canada during the first wave of the pandemic. It found that COVID-19 mortality rates were higher in Canadian neighborhoods with a larger proportion of these population groups. The data showed that between March and July 2020, there were 8,796 COVID-19 deaths in Canada, with the highest numbers in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. The analysis compared COVID-19 mortality rates in Canadian neighborhoods, categorizing them based on the proportion of visible minorities. The results showed that neighborhoods with the highest proportion of visible minorities (25% or more) had COVID-19 mortality rates twice as high as those with the lowest proportion (less than 1%). This pattern was consistent across Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, with the age-standardized mortality rate being three times higher in neighborhoods with the highest proportion of visible minorities in Quebec and Ontario. The article also looked at specific population groups within Montréal and Toronto, the two largest Census Metropolitan Areas in Canada. It found that neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Black Canadians in Montréal and South Asian Canadians in Toronto had significantly higher age-standardized mortality rates compared to neighborhoods with lower proportions of these groups. The article concludes that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain population subgroups, and these patterns are reflected in the COVID-19 mortality rates in Canada. The findings can help inform public health efforts to protect members of visible minority groups as the pandemic evolves. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts could be important: The concentration of specific visible minority groups in certain regions, such as the Black population in Montréal and the South Asian population in Toronto. The socioeconomic factors that contribute to higher poverty rates and overcrowded housing conditions for visible minority groups. The overrepresentation of visible minorities in high-risk occupations. The disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates between neighborhoods with different proportions of visible minorities. By considering these factors and monitoring the COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations within these specific population groups and neighborhoods, public health officials can make more informed predictions about future hospitalization needs and allocate resources accordingly.

Here is a summary of the article: There were 67 new cases of COVID-19 reported in Saskatchewan on October 28, 2020, bringing the total to 2,908 cases. The new cases were distributed across different zones in the province, with the highest number in Saskatoon (25) and the lowest in the South East zone (2). Twenty people were hospitalized, with six in intensive care. The source of transmission for the new cases was under investigation. Of the total cases in the province, 355 were travelers, 1,436 were community contacts, 745 had no known exposures, and 372 were under investigation. The majority of cases were in adults, with 580 cases in people 19 years of age and under. The gender distribution was relatively even, with 51% female and 49% male. To date, 25 deaths related to COVID-19 had been reported in Saskatchewan. The province had conducted 256,082 COVID-19 tests, with a per capita rate of 172,989 people tested per million population. The article also provided guidelines for Halloween activities, recommending against large gatherings and pub crawls. There were multiple outbreaks associated with nightclubs in Saskatoon, leading to a new Public Health Order with enhanced restrictions for nightclubs in the city. Establishments serving liquor were urged to comply with public health orders and guidelines to prevent possible "superspreader" events. Information on COVID-19 testing and general inquiries was provided. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, some important facts to consider include: The number of active cases (666) and the rate of new cases reported daily. The hospitalization rate, which was 20 people hospitalized out of the total 2,908 cases. The distribution of cases across different age groups, with a higher risk of severe illness in older adults. Compliance with public health measures, such as gathering size limits and physical distancing, which can impact the spread of the virus. The testing capacity and positivity rate, which can provide insights into the prevalence of the virus in the community.

Title: Is more testing behind the record numbers of COVID-19 cases in Canada? Your testing questions answered
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
COVID-19 testing is a critical aspect of managing the pandemic, but it can be confusing for many people. Here are some answers to common questions about COVID-19 testing in Canada: The spike in COVID-19 cases in Canada is not solely due to increased testing, as the percentage of positive tests is also increasing in many places. Wastewater surveillance in Ottawa also shows rising COVID-19 levels, independent of testing numbers. Nasal swabs are preferred over fecal samples for testing because the virus is primarily spread through the respiratory tract, and labs are optimized for processing respiratory samples. COVID-19 test samples can last for weeks if stored properly, but delays in processing may require retesting. People who have recovered from COVID-19 may continue to test positive for weeks or months, but they are not contagious during this time. The recommended isolation period is now 10 days after the onset of symptoms in some provinces. Employers can require a negative COVID-19 test before allowing employees to return to work, and they are not obligated to pay employees who cannot work due to a lack of a negative test. Individuals who test negative for COVID-19 but have symptoms may still be advised to self-isolate, as the test may have been taken too early or there may have been an error in sample collection. Pharmacy tests for asymptomatic individuals are available in Alberta and Ontario, and their accuracy is similar to that of provincial testing sites. However, Alberta has stopped testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure to COVID-19. Antibody tests can confirm previous COVID-19 infections but are only available with a doctor's prescription in some provinces and may not be reliable for those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.

Title: Why young people tune out government COVID-19 messaging
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
COVID-19 infection rates are rising in Canada, particularly among young people aged 20-29, despite efforts by politicians to encourage social distancing. Governments have struggled to effectively communicate COVID-19 safety messages to young people, relying mostly on one-way communication that doesn't resonate with this demographic. Research shows that engaging in dialogue with young citizens and utilizing creative content that involves dialogue is more effective in capturing their attention. Social media platforms like TikTok offer a more engaging and preferred communication style for young people, but government messaging in Canada has been slow to adapt to this medium. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has been applauded for his successful use of TikTok, but public health agencies have been hesitant to follow suit, often favoring more traditional top-down messaging. To better connect with young people, public health communicators should utilize platforms like TikTok and understand their audience's needs, fears, and concerns. Speaking to young people like human beings, rather than scolding them, is crucial for effective communication, as demonstrated by Singh's successful strategy.

Title: Some non-human primates bear similar risk as humans for COVID-19 infection
Publisher: University of Calgary
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a study that predicts non-human primates, such as apes and monkeys, are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, with a similar risk level to humans. The risk to lemurs is more variable but could also be high. This is a concern for primatologists working with captive and wild primates, as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species could endanger already vulnerable primate populations. The study used comparative genomics and protein-protein interaction modeling to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to cell surfaces via the ACE2 receptor. Changes in amino acids that build the ACE2 protein can weaken the bonds and impede viral infection. Monkeys in the Americas have different amino acids, which may decrease their risk of infection. The study's authors recommend taking action to protect both non-human primates and humans who may come into contact with them, including increased distancing, mask-wearing, quarantining, health screening, and negative testing. The long-term restrictions on human access to wild primate populations may have negative consequences for local livelihoods and primate conservation efforts, so a careful balance must be considered.

Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the way we work and highlights some of the biggest questions we should be asking as we move forward into a post-pandemic future. Here are the key points raised by the experts: Melinda Gates (Co-Chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) focuses on the issue of gender equality, arguing that the pandemic has disproportionately affected women, who are more likely to lose their jobs and bear the burden of unpaid care work. She hopes that the crisis will lead to a confrontation of the unsustainable status quo and a push for more equitable solutions. Stewart Butterfield (CEO and co-founder of Slack) highlights the opportunity to reimagine work practices and company operations, moving away from the traditional 9-5 office-centric model. He predicts that many employees will opt for a hybrid remote-office work model and that businesses that successfully embrace digital transformation will have a competitive advantage. Elisabeth Reynolds (MIT) raises concerns about the 60% of workers who cannot work from home and the impact of declining commuters on the service industries that support them. She calls for strengthening the social safety net and investing in skills development for vulnerable workers. Indranil Roy (Deloitte Consulting) discusses the characteristics of organizations adopting a "virtual-first" approach, including a distributed workplace, virtual-ready teams, enabling technology, and a culture prioritizing trust and belonging. Diane Coyle (University of Cambridge) points to the economic shock of the pandemic as an opportunity to address issues such as low pay and poor working conditions for key workers, as well as environmental concerns. She also highlights the changing perception of the state's role in the economy, with governments intervening more actively in managing economic crises. Eric Yuan (Founder and CEO of Zoom) predicts that video communications will permanently shape how businesses and individuals connect, with organizations adopting either a hybrid-work or fully remote model, leading to increased productivity, collaboration, and workforce diversity. Erica Brescia (GitHub) emphasizes the shift towards remote work by default, which will require people to reframe their communication styles and companies to operate more like open-source communities. Robin Dunbar (University of Oxford) cautions against the hype surrounding remote working, arguing that face-to-face engagement is crucial for maintaining the 'flow' of work and a sense of belonging in organizations. He also highlights the social aspect of work for young people and the limitations of virtual meetings. Jean-Nicolas Reyt (McGill University) discusses the potential for working from home to increase gender equality, as it may provide more flexibility for parents and reduce the negative impact of gender stereotypes on career advancement. Overall, the article presents a range of perspectives on how COVID-19 may shape the future of work, including the potential for more flexible and remote work arrangements, the need for social safety nets, the changing role of the state, and the potential benefits for gender equality.
