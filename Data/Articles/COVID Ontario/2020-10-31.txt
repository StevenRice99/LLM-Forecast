Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This text appears to be a report or study on mortality rates among visible minority groups in Canada, using data from the provinces and territories. The report highlights some methodological limitations and considerations in their analysis.
Here are the key points:
Methodology: 
The report uses provisional death counts and estimates provided by provincial and territorial vital statistical offices.
The data is based on 2016 Census population counts, which may not match figures from other sources.
Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for each neighbourhood at national, provincial, and Census Metropolitan Area (Montréal and Toronto) levels.
Data limitations: 
Reporting delays in death reporting by provinces and territories may affect estimated mortality rates and observed differences between provinces or territories.
Provisional data may not match figures from other sources, such as media reports or counts and estimates from provincial or territorial health authorities.
Neighborhood classification: 
Dissemination areas (DAs) were classified into four categories based on the proportion of population groups designated as visible minorities:
1. Less than 1%
2. 1% to less than 10%
3. 10% to less than 25%
4. 25% and over
Visible minority definition: 
The report defines visible minority as "persons other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour".
Visible minority groups include South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Arab, Southeast Asian, west Asian, Korean, and Japanese.
References: 
The report cites several studies and reports on COVID-19-related health disparities among ethnic minorities and immigrants in Canada.
