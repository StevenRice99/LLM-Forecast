Posted: 1 day ago
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected older adults and residents of disadvantaged urban neighborhoods in Ontario, Canada. The article examines the impact of age and neighborhood on SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths in Ontario. It also proposes a vaccination strategy that considers both age and neighborhood to minimize deaths and hospitalizations. Key findings include: Ontario neighborhoods with the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rates are in Toronto, Peel, York, and Windsor-Essex regions. COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are strongly associated with age and neighborhood, with 50% of deaths occurring in just 4% of the population aged 16+ and living in high-incidence neighborhoods. A mass vaccination strategy that prioritizes based on both age and neighborhood can prevent more deaths and hospitalizations than a strategy based on age alone. The proposed strategy identifies individuals with the highest priority for vaccination, preventing the largest number of deaths and hospitalizations. The article includes projections for SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths in Ontario from December 7, 2020, to May 31, 2021. It assumes a return to lockdown with a stay-at-home order on March 10 due to the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant. Three vaccine distribution scenarios are compared: no additional vaccination, mass distribution based on age alone, and mass distribution based on age and neighborhood. The proposed vaccination strategy based on age and neighborhood is projected to prevent an additional 3,767 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 702 hospitalizations, 145 ICU admissions, and 168 deaths compared to the age-only strategy. The strategy ensures that Ontarians at the highest risk of infection, hospitalization, or death receive vaccines first. In conclusion, a mass vaccination strategy that considers both age and neighborhood of residence can effectively minimize deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in Ontario. This approach identifies individuals with the highest priority for vaccination, targeting those at the greatest risk.

The National Vaccine Safety Network, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has launched a survey to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The survey aims to collect information on any adverse events following immunization, including severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and other health problems that may be potentially linked to the vaccines. The data collected will help public health officials better understand the safety profile of the COVID-9 vaccines and identify any rare or unexpected side effects. The survey is being conducted through a secure online platform and is open to anyone who has received a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. Participants are asked to provide information on their vaccination, including the type and lot number of the vaccine, the date of vaccination, and any adverse events or health problems experienced afterward. This survey is an important tool to complement existing vaccine safety monitoring systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the CDC's text-based v-safe program. By actively reaching out to vaccinated individuals and collecting detailed information, the National Vaccine Safety Network survey can help provide a more complete picture of the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The data collected from this survey will be analyzed by experts in vaccine safety and used to inform public health policies and communication regarding COVID-19 vaccines. It will also help healthcare providers and individuals make more informed decisions about vaccine use. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the data collected from this survey can provide valuable insights into the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. By identifying any rare or serious side effects, public health officials can better assess the risks and benefits of the vaccines and make more accurate predictions about hospitalization rates. Additionally, monitoring vaccine safety can help identify any specific groups or individuals who may be at higher risk of adverse events, allowing for more targeted interventions and support. Overall, the launch of this survey by the National Vaccine Safety Network is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and providing data to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. The active surveillance and analysis of adverse events following immunization will help inform public health responses and ensure that any potential risks are identified and communicated in a timely manner.

Title: A Neanderthal OAS1 isoform protects individuals of European ancestry against COVID-19 susceptibility and severity
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article presents a study that aims to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) associations from six large proteomic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to assess their link with COVID-19 outcomes. The study used COVID-19 meta-analytic GWAS data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative to analyze three outcomes: very severe COVID-19, hospitalization due to COVID-19, and susceptibility to COVID-19. The article then discusses the two-sample MR analysis used to screen and test the role of circulating proteins in influencing these COVID-19 outcomes. The study also assessed the potential for horizontal pleiotropy, which is when the genetic variant affects the outcome through pathways other than the exposure. Additionally, the article describes the co-localization analysis performed to test the co-localization of the genetic signal for circulating proteins and COVID-19 outcomes. The study also included measurement of plasma OAS1 protein levels and their association with COVID-19 outcomes in the BQC19 initiative. The results of the study provide insights into the genetic factors influencing COVID-19 severity and susceptibility, which can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and develop targeted interventions.

COVID-19 has impacted federal prisons in Canada much harder during the second wave than the first, with 880 infections in the second wave compared to 361 in the first. Correctional Investigator Ivan Zinger recommends prioritizing inmate vaccination to prevent further outbreaks. While the government has started vaccinating elderly and vulnerable prisoners, Zinger calls for a more comprehensive strategy. He also highlights the negative impact of restrictive measures and lockdowns on inmate health. The prisons with the highest number of Indigenous offenders were hardest hit, which Zinger attributes to outdated infrastructure. He recommends exploring alternatives to incarceration and improving community-based corrections. Despite early releases and reduced admissions, prisoners still face restrictions like canceled visits and limited outdoor exercise. Experts emphasize the need to depopulate prisons and provide community supports to limit COVID-19's spread and protect inmates from harsh conditions.
