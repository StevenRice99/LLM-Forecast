This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: COVID-19 variants are expected to make up 40% of all Ontario cases by the second week of March, leading to a likely increase in daily infections and hospitalizations. Modelling data suggests that in the worst-case scenario, Ontario could see 4,000 new infections daily by the end of March, with 2,500 cases per day in a more likely scenario, and 500 daily infections in the best-case scenario. The number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU could rise back up to 350 by the end of March in the worst-case scenario, making it "impossible" to handle non-COVID-19 needs in hospitals. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions are expected to increase as the COVID-19 variants spread across the province. The province has seen a significant decrease in daily COVID-19 infections over the last two months, but the decline has started to level off. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 40%: expected proportion of COVID-19 variants in Ontario cases by the second week of March 4,000: daily infections in the worst-case scenario by the end of March 2,500: daily infections in a more likely scenario by the end of March 500: daily infections in the best-case scenario by the end of March 350: number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU in the worst-case scenario by the end of March 150: number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU that makes it harder to support non-COVID-19 needs in hospitals
