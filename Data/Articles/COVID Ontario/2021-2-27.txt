Title: Blood tests could be early indicator of COVID-19 severity: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Summary: Elevated neutrophil levels in blood tests can predict a patient's likelihood of requiring ICU care, ventilation, or death due to COVID-19. Neutrophils are associated with inflammatory diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Patients with high neutrophil markers were more likely to become critically ill.

Title: A Strategy for the Mass Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Based on Age and Neighbourhood

This text describes a comprehensive modeling approach to predict and project COVID-19-related outcomes in Ontario, Canada. The authors used a combination of statistical models (Generalized Additive Model) and deterministic projection models to estimate the impact of different vaccine distribution scenarios on SARS-CoV-2 incidence, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death rates.
Here's a summary of the key points:
1. Modeling approach: The authors used a Generalized Additive Model with random intercept for neighborhood variation and penalized spline for time to estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence deciles.
2. Projection scenarios: Three vaccine distribution scenarios were compared:
Scenario 1 (Control): No change in vaccination rates.
Scenario 2: Increased vaccination rates, targeting high-risk populations first.
Scenario 3: Increased vaccination rates, with a focus on age-specific and risk-based prioritization.
3. Assumptions:
R(t) for traditional variants would increase linearly from log(1.00) to log(1.09) between February 25 and March 10, 2021.
Lockdown measures starting on March 10, 2021, would decrease R(t) to 0.82 by March 20, 2021.
B.1.1.7 variant would be 40% more transmissible than traditional variants.
Hospital occupancy (ICU and non-ICU) and deaths from COVID-19 would follow specific percentage-based assumptions.
4. Projection results: The authors projected daily updated plausible estimates of SARS-CoV-2 incidence, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death rates between February 25 and May 31, 2021, for each scenario.
5. Key findings: The projections showed that Scenario 3 (age-specific and risk-based prioritization) would lead to significant reductions in COVID-19-related outcomes compared to the control scenario.
This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven approach to understanding the potential impact of different vaccine distribution strategies on COVID-19-related outcomes in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Here is when adults 80 and up can start getting COVID-19 vaccines in Ottawa
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
91% of long-term care home residents had received both required vaccine doses as of Feb 14
84% of retirement home residents had received their first shot as of Feb 21
The province estimates it will need 88,000 doses to vaccinate all adults 80 and older who want a vaccine (relevant for Ontario-wide hospitalization forecasting)
Provincial priorities for the remainder phase one include: adults 80 years of age and older; staff, residents, and caregivers in retirement homes; high-priority health-care workers; Indigenous adults; and adult recipients of chronic home care.

Title: No more driving from Huron-Perth to London for vaccine
Publisher: CTV News London
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article mentions:
Vaccine arrival in Huron and Perth counties
Increased vaccine distribution efficiency with on-site storage
Completion of long-term care and high-risk retirement home vaccinations
Planned mid-March vaccination expansion to residents over 80 and more healthcare workers
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Vaccination rate, case counts, age demographics (especially 80), and vaccine distribution efficiency.
