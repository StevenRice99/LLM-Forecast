Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago

Number of people in hospital with COVID-19: 1,141
Number of people in intensive care due to COVID-19: 129
Number of patients on a ventilator: 58 (up from 56 last week)
Test positivity rate: 13.1% (up from 12.2% last Thursday)

Title: Municipal and neighbourhood level wastewater surveillance and subtyping of an influenza virus outbreak
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the results of a study on influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 viral signals in wastewater samples from three neighborhoods in Ottawa, Canada. The main findings are:
1. Neighbourhood 1 showed the earliest peaks of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 viral signals compared to other neighborhoods and the citywide signal.
2. This neighborhood also had a significantly lower mean age of residents, suggesting more children who could have contributed to earlier transmission of IAV and SARS-CoV-2.
3. Neighbourhood 1 saw significantly more elevated viral signals for both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 on several occasions, indicating more in-community transmission of both viruses.
4. The IAV and SARS-CoV-2 viral signals in neighbourhood 2 did not deviate significantly from the citywide signal, suggesting a similar population distribution to the city as a whole.
5. Neighbourhood 3 had the highest population density and saw elevated PMMoV-normalized IAV viral signal levels, suggesting more congregate living situations that favored community transmission of IAV.
6. The study also found that detecting IAV in wastewater samples can be an effective and economical strategy to track influenza activity.
The text highlights the potential of wastewater surveillance for public health purposes, particularly for monitoring the timing, location, and magnitude of influenza activity. It suggests that wastewater viral signal differences at the neighborhood level may be influenced by population characteristics, transmission dynamics, or a combination of both.

Title: Opioid program leads to drop in ER visits: study
Publisher: CityNews Calgary
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Summary: The article mentions a 96% increase in apparent opioid toxicity deaths during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Specifically, it highlights that Ontario was one of the provinces with high increases in opioid-related overdose deaths (along with British Columbia and Alberta). This information could be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as it provides context on the broader public health landscape during the same time period.
