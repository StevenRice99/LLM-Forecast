The article discusses a study that suggests that the COVID-19 lockdown may have inadvertently accelerated the transmission of HIV in some at-risk populations. Here is a summary: Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of Pittsburgh studied the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. The study found that the lockdown measures, including stay-at-home orders and the closure of many public spaces, may have unintentionally increased the risk of HIV transmission within these communities. The study analyzed data from over 2,000 MSM and transgender women across the United States, collected between March and July 2020, during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period. The researchers found that participants reported a decrease in sexual partners and a slight increase in condomless anal intercourse during the lockdown. However, there was also a reported increase in drug use and condomless sex with casual partners among a subset of the participants, which the researchers termed "sexual adventurism." The study suggests that the COVID-19 lockdown may have created a "perfect storm" for HIV transmission within these at-risk populations. The reduction in sexual partners and increased isolation may have led to riskier sexual behavior, as individuals sought out sexual opportunities and engaged in "pandemic partner shopping." Additionally, the closure of health clinics and disruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services may have further contributed to the potential rise in HIV transmission. The findings have important implications for public health measures and the forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The study highlights the need to consider the indirect consequences of lockdown measures on other health issues, such as HIV transmission. By understanding these complex interactions, public health officials can develop more holistic approaches to pandemic response and improve forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations, taking into account the potential impact on other health services and behaviors. Overall, this study adds to the growing body of research that helps us understand the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on various aspects of public health and society.

Title: Vitamin D is No Cure for COVID
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article argues that vitamin D has been incorrectly touted as a cheap and easy way to prevent or cure COVID-19. While early observational studies suggested a link between low vitamin D levels and worse COVID-19 outcomes, the author emphasizes the problem of reverse causation, where the illness itself may be causing the vitamin D deficiency rather than the deficiency causing the illness. Randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold standard in scientific research, have failed to show any benefit of vitamin D supplementation in preventing or treating COVID-19. The CORONAVIT study, which tested both low and high doses of vitamin D, found no reduction in the risk of contracting COVID-19. Another study published in the British Medical Journal used cod liver oil, a natural source of vitamin D, and also found no benefit. The author concludes that despite preliminary lab data and persistent belief in the effectiveness of vitamin D, the randomized trial evidence consistently shows that it does not prevent or treat COVID-19. Therefore, it should not be relied upon for COVID-19 prevention or treatment.

Title: Why You Should Rest—a Lot—If You Have COVID-19
Publisher: TIME
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article emphasizes the importance of rest in managing and potentially preventing Long COVID. While the only sure way to avoid Long COVID is to not get infected with SARS-CoV-2, adequate rest gives the body and immune system the best chance to fight off the infection. Returning to normal activities too soon can lead to a "crash" in Long COVID patients, characterized by symptoms like exhaustion, migraines, brain fog, and nausea. Rest can help manage these symptoms and prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM), a worsening of symptoms after physical, mental, or emotional exertion. Pacing, or rationing out activity with rest periods, is recommended by the CDC and has been found helpful by many long-haulers. This approach is similar to the management of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a condition with overlapping symptoms and impairments in mitochondria energy generation. Clinicians are advised to recommend rest and pacing instead of gradual increases in physical activity, which can be harmful to patients with ME/CFS or Long COVID. Socioeconomic factors can make resting a challenge for many, and accommodations such as working from home or disability support may be necessary for those with Long COVID or ME/CFS. Overall, rest and pacing are crucial tools in the management and potential prevention of Long COVID, helping to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.

Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found that people infected with COVID-19 have an increased risk of developing neurological conditions within the first year after infection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, analyzed federal health data and found that COVID-19 has contributed to over 40 million new cases of neurological disorders worldwide. The specific neurological complications include strokes, cognitive and memory issues (colloquially called "brain fog"), depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, movement disorders (tremors, involuntary muscle contractions), epileptic seizures, hearing and vision problems, and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The study compared 154,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and January 15, 2021, with two control groups of uninfected individuals. It was found that neurological conditions occurred in 7% more of those who had COVID-19, which equates to roughly 6.6 million people in the US suffering from brain impairments associated with the virus. Memory problems were the most common long-COVID symptom, with infected individuals having a 77% increased risk. There was also an observed increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, with two more cases per 1,000 people with COVID-19 compared to the control groups. Infected individuals were also 50% more likely to suffer from ischemic strokes, and overall, they were 80% more likely to experience epilepsy or seizures, 43% more likely to develop mental health disorders, 35% more likely to have headaches, and 42% more likely to have movement disorders. The study highlights the need for governments and health systems to develop policies and strategies to manage the ongoing pandemic and plan for the long-term effects of COVID-19, including neurological complications. It's important to note that the data predates the Delta and Omicron variants, and that vaccination slightly reduces the risk of long-term brain problems by about 20%.

Title: Ontario reports 65 new COVID-19 deaths, with vaccine uptake for children lower than expected
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario reported 65 new COVID-19-related deaths and a slight decrease in hospitalizations due to the virus. The number of patients in intensive care remains stable, while test positivity climbed slightly. Despite shots being available for two months, only about six percent of children under five have received their first dose, which is lower than expected. The low uptake may be due to misinformation and beliefs that the pandemic is over or that COVID-19 is mild in children. Toronto pulled vaccination ads that implied unvaccinated children couldn't play with friends. Health officials emphasize that conversations with pediatricians and primary care providers are key to addressing parents' concerns and increasing vaccine uptake. The risk of severe illness in young children is real, and hospitalizations for infants under one have notably increased. With schools back in session, vaccination is important to reduce transmission and protect vulnerable individuals.

COVID-19 continues to be a significant health concern in the Americas, with approximately 4,000 deaths per week, while monkeypox cases are also on the rise. Additionally, the detection of the polio virus in unvaccinated communities in New York underscores the importance of strengthening surveillance and routine vaccination campaigns. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director emphasizes the need to improve COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, especially in the Caribbean, to keep the virus under control. The article also highlights the importance of public health measures and community engagement in addressing the spread of monkeypox. With the upcoming Pan American Sanitary Conference, there is an opportunity to discuss challenges and make agreements to improve health in the region. The article mentions the following important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: COVID-19 deaths: Around 4,000 lives lost per week in the Americas. Vaccination rates: Vaccination coverage has dropped below 80% in nearly all of South America, leaving populations vulnerable. Risk of outbreak: 12 countries in the region are at high or very high risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. Public health measures: Emphasis on promoting public health measures, especially in areas with low vaccination rates or climbing cases. Caribbean lag: The Caribbean is falling behind in vaccination campaigns, requiring additional attention and resources. Monkeypox concerns: While rare, deaths from monkeypox can occur, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems.

The Government of Canada is encouraging workplaces to implement COVID-19 rapid testing as part of their screening process to help identify asymptomatic individuals who may be carrying the virus. This is an additional layer of protection on top of existing measures such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and vaccination. Rapid tests are easy to use and provide quick results, helping to keep employees and communities safe. The Government of Canada is providing access to free COVID-19 rapid tests for interested workplaces. This strategy can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and potentially decrease hospitalizations by identifying and isolating infected individuals who are not showing symptoms but may still be contagious.

Title: Canadian scientists made life-saving contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: The Conversation Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Canada has made significant contributions to the development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, with several Canadian scientists involved in the process. The country has also approved the use of adenovirus-based vaccines, with Canadian scientists playing a key role in their development. It is estimated that the vaccines saved approximately 19.8 million lives in 2021, including over 310,000 in Canada. However, the Canadian government has not placed sufficient value on scientific research, with funding for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) being significantly lower compared to its counterparts in the United States. This lack of investment could lead to a brain drain, as scientists seek better opportunities in other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of scientific research and Canada's lack of preparedness. Investing in research is crucial for addressing future health challenges, such as pandemics, antibiotic resistance, cancer, age-related diseases, and diabetes.

Title: COVID-19 increases risk of developing Alzheimer's by 50-80% in older adults
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: Association of COVID-19 with New-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study Objective: To investigate the potential link between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the development of new-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a large retrospective cohort study. Methods: The study analyzed data from 6,245,282 adults over the age of 65 without a prior AD diagnosis. The participants were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2 positive (410,748 individuals) and SARS-CoV-2 negative (5,834,534 individuals). The risk of developing AD was assessed using electronic health records, with demographic matching and adjustment for various factors. Results: The study found that prior to demographic matching, the risk of new-onset AD was 0.7% in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and 0.4% in the negative group. However, after matching, the risk increased in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group (HR: 1.7). The risk was higher for females (HR: 1.8) compared to males (HR: 1.5) and was most significant in adults aged 85 and above (HR: 1.9). Blacks and Whites had a similar risk (HR: 1.6), while Hispanics had a slightly lower risk (HR: 1.3). Conclusion: The study suggests a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 infections and an increased risk of new-onset Alzheimer's disease, especially in older female adults. However, further research with longer follow-up periods is needed to validate these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms. Implications for COVID-19 Hospitalizations: The study's results indicate that COVID-19 hospitalizations may need to consider the potential long-term neurological impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in older female patients. The increased risk of AD could have implications for patient care and discharge planning, as well as highlight the need for continued neurological monitoring post-infection.
