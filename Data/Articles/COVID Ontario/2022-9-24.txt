This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 has dropped slightly to 1,141 from 1,167 last week. The number of people in intensive care due to COVID-19 has remained relatively stable at 129. Test positivity has climbed slightly to 13.1% from 12.2% last week. Vaccination rates for children under the age of 5 are lower than expected, with only about 6% having received their first dose. Experts are concerned about the low vaccination rate, citing misinformation and complacency as contributing factors. There has been a notable increase in hospitalizations for infants under 1 year old, with 17 children hospitalized for the week of Sept. 4-10 compared to 8 the week prior. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the current state of the pandemic, vaccination rates, and hospitalization trends. The low vaccination rate among children under 5 and the increase in hospitalizations for infants under 1 year old are particularly concerning and may indicate a potential increase in hospitalizations in the coming weeks.

TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study focuses on wastewater surveillance (WWS) of Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 in Ottawa, Ontario, and explores its potential as an early warning system for public health. The key findings include: 1. WWS detected IAV in Ottawa 17 days before the first clinical detection. 2. The study found a moderate correlation between WWS IAV concentrations and weekly IAV clinical positivity rates (Pearson's r = 0.50, p < 0.05, n = 14). 3. Time-step correlation analysis revealed that shifting the IAV wastewater signal 17 days forward increased the correlation coefficient to 0.97 (p < 0.05, n = 14). 4. The lead time of WWS over clinical testing ranged from 15 to 21 days. 5. The study suggests that WWS can provide an early warning system for public health, allowing for timely implementation of mitigation measures and confirmation of outbreak resolution. These findings have implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as WWS can potentially serve as a complementary tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 transmission and predicting hospitalization rates. By analyzing wastewater data, public health officials may be able to identify trends and patterns that can inform decision-making and resource allocation.
