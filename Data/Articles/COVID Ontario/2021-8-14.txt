Trusted: True
Posted: Today
The article is a handout for pharmacies in Canada, informing them about the availability of COVID-19 rapid tests for distribution to small and medium-sized businesses and non-profit organizations. The goal is to help these organizations implement workplace screening to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks and maintain safe working environments. Here are the key points: COVID-19 rapid tests are now accessible at participating pharmacies for distribution to eligible businesses and organizations. Workplace screening using rapid tests is easy to set up and requires few resources. Rapid tests are nasal swabs that are safe and simple to use, delivering results in 15 minutes. They should be administered twice weekly. Regular testing can help identify asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19, protecting workers, customers, and the broader community while also limiting the virus's spread and keeping businesses operational. Small and medium-sized enterprises can obtain rapid tests by directly contacting participating pharmacies. This initiative is intended to assist companies in establishing early warning systems to detect COVID-19 cases and prevent outbreaks. By identifying asymptomatic individuals, rapid testing can play a crucial role in breaking the chain of transmission. This, combined with other public health measures, can help forecast and reduce hospitalizations due to COVID-19, as early detection and isolation can prevent the disease from spreading and reaching severe stages.

Publisher: USask News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The University of Saskatchewan (USask) is implementing stronger vaccination and health safety measures to protect its campuses and the wider community from COVID-19 and its variants. From this, we can infer that COVID-19 hospitalizations may increase if safety measures are not taken, especially with the emergence of new variants and low vaccination rates among those under 30 in Saskatchewan. By September 7, individuals must provide proof of their first vaccination dose, and by October 18, they must provide proof of their second dose. Those who are unwilling or unable to get vaccinated will need to undergo regular COVID-19 testing and submit daily symptom checklists to access USask campuses. These measures are based on recommendations from the university's Pandemic Response and Recovery Team and consultations with other experts and institutions. The university president, Peter Stoicheff, emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and testing to ensure a safe return to in-person activities by January. Additionally, vaccinations will be mandatory for individuals involved in higher-risk activities, such as living in residence or participating in Huskie Athletics. Exemptions will be considered in alignment with The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. Current COVID-19 health and safety measures, such as indoor mask requirements and enhanced cleaning, will remain in place. The university is also reviewing other areas of programming with elevated transmission risks. The university's leadership and Board of Governors endorse these new measures to protect the health and safety of the university community and beyond. Details on providing proof of vaccination and frequently asked questions about the new measures are available on the USask website.

Title: Fourth wave of COVID-19 now underway in Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam says - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Canada's top health official, Dr. Theresa Tam, announced that the country is experiencing a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Delta variant. Active cases have doubled in the last two weeks, with an average of 1,500 new cases reported daily, mainly in the 20-39 age group. Hospitalizations are also increasing, with an average of 511 people being treated daily, a 12% increase from last week. While deaths remain low, at about 7 per day, the Delta variant is highly contagious, and the majority of cases and hospitalizations are in those not fully vaccinated. Canada's vaccination rate is currently at 82% partially vaccinated and 71% fully vaccinated. Dr. Tam urged unvaccinated Canadians, especially young adults, to get vaccinated to reduce the impact of the fourth wave on the healthcare system. Health officials are also monitoring the potential need for booster shots for certain populations. Canada has also donated 10 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to low and middle-income countries through the COVAX sharing program.

Title: What will it be like when COVID-19 becomes endemic?
Publisher: HSPH News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the likelihood of COVID-19 becoming an endemic disease and how our understanding of respiratory viruses and pandemic history can inform our expectations and actions. According to Yonatan Grad, an associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases, several factors will shape the future of COVID-19, including natural infection immunity, vaccination, social contact patterns, and virus transmissibility. Regarding endemicity, the article explains that the pandemic is unlikely to end with the virus disappearing entirely. Instead, a combination of vaccination and natural infection is expected to reduce transmission and hospitalizations. However, SARS-CoV-2 will likely continue to circulate, unlike the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, which were contained through public health measures. The transition to endemicity depends on factors such as immune protection strength and duration, patterns of social contact, and virus transmissibility. The global response to COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, with varying vaccine availability and uptake, further complicating the timeline. Historical examples of deadly viruses becoming manageable threats include the 1918 flu pandemic and more recent influenza pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. These pandemics typically started with higher infection fatality rates, which declined over time, possibly due to the protective effects of initial exposure or vaccination. The need for annual COVID-19 booster shots is uncertain and depends on biological and policy considerations. Biologically, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and its ability to evade the immune system will influence the need for boosters. Additionally, the duration and nature of immune protection, as well as the impact of vaccination on infection, disease severity, and transmission, are key factors. On the policy side, the acceptable burden of disease in the population needs to be determined. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of investing in global public health infrastructure and surveillance systems to prepare for future potential pandemic viruses. It also emphasizes the value of applying lessons learned from COVID-19, such as ventilation and masking, to reduce the impact of other respiratory viruses and infectious diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. Finally, it notes that past pandemics have led to significant long-term improvements in individual and global health, and COVID-19 may have similar positive outcomes. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, factors to consider include vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, the availability and effectiveness of treatments, and the overall strength of healthcare systems in different regions. These factors will influence the trajectory of the pandemic and the burden on healthcare resources.

Title: 'No doubt' Canada now in 4th wave of COVID-19 as cases spike across much of the country
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Canada is facing a potential fourth wave of COVID-19, with cases rising across several provinces. While the country's vaccination rate of 60% fully vaccinated individuals has lessened the impact, experts warn that precautions such as mask-wearing and social distancing must be maintained to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system. The highly contagious Delta variant is driving the increase in cases, predominantly among unvaccinated individuals. To protect those who are unable to get vaccinated, such as children under 12, it is crucial to encourage more Canadians to get vaccinated and maintain public health measures.

Title: Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy and public health measures. It summarizes the current knowledge about four variants of concern (VOCs) designated by the WHO: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). These variants have undergone mutations, particularly in the S gene, which have raised concerns about their impact on infection rates and vaccine effectiveness. In vitro studies and clinical trials have shown that while vaccine efficacy may be slightly reduced against these VOCs, the vaccines still offer good protection against severe disease. The Novavax vaccine showed 86% efficacy against the Alpha variant and 49% against the Beta variant in clinical trials. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine had lower efficacy in Latin America and South Africa, possibly due to the higher prevalence of the Beta variant. The AZD1222 vaccine did not demonstrate protection against mild to moderate disease caused by the Beta variant. For the Delta variant, the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines showed 88% and 67% effectiveness, respectively, against symptomatic disease. The article concludes that while new VOCs will continue to emerge, the current vaccines remain highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. It discusses the suggestion of developing new vaccines targeting specific variants but highlights potential drawbacks, such as manufacturing capacity and the 'original antigenic sin' phenomenon. Instead, boosting immunity with a third dose of the original vaccine may be a more effective strategy, although further studies are needed to determine the impact on immunity and considerations about equity in vaccine distribution.

Title: Was COVID-19 research funding well spent? — University Affairs
Publisher: University Affairs
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) provided significant funding to support COVID-19 research, distributing more than $236 million to various projects. Some academics questioned the creation of specific funding for COVID-19 research, suggesting that the money could have been added to regular open competitions to boost grant success rates and potentially yield discoveries relevant to the pandemic and future diseases. However, others argued that directed funding was necessary due to the urgent need to respond to the pandemic and the lack of sufficient funding in Canadian labs. The CIHR accepted a wide range of project applications but asked reviewers to prioritize those with potential for immediate aid in the pandemic response. In retrospect, some suggested that the early competitions should have been more focused on specific topics like virus transmission, basic biology, and surveillance capacity. As the pandemic situation eases, researchers hope that the value of basic research has been highlighted, and they will advocate for greater investment in both pandemic-specific and fundamental science.
