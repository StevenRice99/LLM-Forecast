Title: Universities, colleges taking varied approaches to COVID-19 as students set to return to campus
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
As the new academic term approaches, Canadian post-secondary institutions are adopting varied approaches to managing COVID-19, ranging from booster shot mandates to simply encouraging students to get vaccinated and wear masks. Western University in London, Ontario, has faced a backlash from students for its decision to mandate a primary series of shots and one booster for all returning students, with some criticizing the timing and consistency of the announcement. However, Western University maintains that its decision aligns with policies at several prominent North American universities. A similar mandate has been implemented by Huron University College, affiliated with Western University, and the University of Toronto for students living in residences. Meanwhile, other universities, such as Dalhousie University, the University of New Brunswick, and Memorial University, are focusing on reintroducing indoor masking requirements. The majority of schools are encouraging COVID-19 boosters and practices such as masking and staying home when ill, but the specific rules vary within regions and even between neighboring institutions. This inconsistency has left some students, like Madelyn Mackintosh of McGill University, feeling uneasy about the lack of standardized pandemic protocols across campuses. Experts in infectious diseases offer differing opinions on the effectiveness of vaccine mandates. Dr. Zain Chagla emphasizes the importance of encouraging positive public health behaviors, improving ventilation, providing accessible testing, and establishing safe isolation spaces. He questions the value of booster mandates given the varying immunity levels across the population and the waning efficacy of boosters. Dr. Lisa Barrett echoes similar sentiments, suggesting that practical access to tests, masks, and on-campus vaccination are more effective measures than booster mandates for preventing infections and transmissions. On the other hand, Dr. Samir Gupta acknowledges that while boosters may not prevent infections or transmissions with the latest variants, they can provide protection against severe disease. Dr. Allison McGeer strongly supports vaccine mandates, stating that they will undoubtedly reduce illness and transmission within the mandated population. As Canadian universities navigate the upcoming term, the varying approaches to COVID-19 management highlight the ongoing challenges and uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. While some students and experts criticize vaccine and booster mandates, others emphasize their potential benefits in ensuring a safe return to in-person learning and maintaining the quality of education.

Title: Coming to France? Your Covid-19 questions answered
Publisher: France Diplomatie
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
As of March 14, 2022, the French government has lifted the "vaccine pass" and COVID certificate requirements for entry into most venues and establishments. The health check system at borders has also been removed, and travelers to France are no longer required to complete any formalities or provide proof of vaccination, a negative test, or recovery. However, the government maintains the option to reinstate certain measures, such as requiring a negative virological test for travelers from countries with dangerous variants. Mask-wearing is also no longer mandatory in public establishments or transport but is still recommended in enclosed spaces and for vulnerable individuals. These changes suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in France are expected to remain stable or decrease, as the government relaxes restrictions.

Title: Working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic: How rates in Canada and the United States compare
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article compares work-from-home rates in Canada and the United States from May 2020 to December 2021 to analyze trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, about 37% of Canadian employees and 35% of American employees worked from home, with similar rates for men and women. Throughout 2021, Canada maintained more stringent COVID-19 restrictions than the United States, which may have influenced work-from-home rates. Women had higher work-from-home rates than men in both countries, with Canadian women having the highest rate at 43% in May 2020. Core-age employees (25-54) were more likely to work from home, with 43% in Canada and 39% in the US in May 2020. Full-time employees worked from home more than part-time employees in both countries, with similar rates early in the pandemic (39% in Canada, 38% in the US). Educational attainment influenced work arrangements, with higher-educated employees more likely to work from home, especially in Canada. Industries with the highest work-from-home rates included educational services, professional services, and financial activities. The percentage of employees working from home declined across all industries in both countries, with faster declines in the US. By December 2021, work-from-home rates had fallen to about 22% in Canada and 11% in the United States. The article provides insights into how COVID-19 restrictions and other factors influenced work-from-home trends in Canada and the United States during the pandemic. The data can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by indicating the potential impact of work-from-home policies on virus transmission and community spread.

Title: How to get rid of Paxlovid mouth: COVID-19 experts share tips
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
In December 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid, an antiviral medication for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (aged 12 and above) who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Paxlovid, manufactured by Pfizer, combines two drugs: nirmatrelvir, which stops the SARS-CoV-2 virus from replicating, and ritonavir, which slows the breakdown of nirmatrelvir in the body. One potential side effect of Paxlovid is dysgeusia, commonly known as "Paxlovid mouth," which causes a constant bad taste (metallic, bitter, salty, or rancid) in the mouth and can alter the taste of food and beverages. Approximately 6% of patients in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial experienced this side effect. While "Paxlovid mouth" is not considered a direct threat to overall health, the unpleasant taste may lead some patients to discontinue their treatment prematurely. This early discontinuation of Paxlovid could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, hospitalization, and death for those at high risk, according to medical experts. It is important for patients to complete the full course of Paxlovid treatment, despite the unpleasant side effect of dysgeusia, to effectively eradicate the virus and reduce the chances of mutation and more severe problems.

Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Laurier University is preparing for the fall term while prioritizing the health and safety of its community. From September 8, face coverings will be mandatory in instructional spaces, including indoor gatherings related to academic courses. This measure aims to limit the spread of COVID-19, especially in close-proximity and higher-capacity settings. Mask-wearing is optional elsewhere, but designated mask-only study spaces will be available. The university's COVID-19 vaccination policy is currently paused, but boosters are encouraged to prevent disruptions. Daily symptom screening is no longer required, but self-monitoring is advised, and those who are ill should stay away from campus. The university plans to provide free masks and is reviewing opportunities for on-campus vaccination clinics. While the current pandemic wave may have plateaued, an increase in cases is expected in the fall as people gather indoors. Implementing measures like masking, enhanced ventilation, and vaccinations can reduce transmission and severe illness, ensuring a safe and healthy environment for all.

Here is a summary of the article: As children return to school for the fourth academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic, parents and experts are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. While vaccines have provided a high level of population immunity, new variants and the upcoming respiratory virus season create uncertainty. Dr. Manish Sadarangani, a pediatrics professor and father of three, offers advice and insights for parents. According to Dr. Sadarangani, vaccination is the safest way to build immunity, and he encourages parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible. He notes that while higher levels of immunity reduce the need for extra precautions in schools, finding the right balance between risks and benefits is crucial, especially for children at high risk. He suggests that parents consider their family's unique situation and consult healthcare professionals for advice on mask-wearing and other precautions. When talking to children about COVID-19 and the new school year, Dr. Sadarangani recommends using language that they understand and tailoring the level of information to their needs. He emphasizes the importance of keeping the conversation open and ongoing, checking in with children regularly to gauge their feelings and concerns. He also advises parents to reassure their children that they are safe, regardless of their choice to wear a mask or not. Finally, Dr. Sadarangani directs parents to resources from the Government of British Columbia and the BC Centre for Disease Control for the latest information on COVID-19 and schools. He reminds parents to stay up-to-date with local health authorities, school districts, and their child's school, as guidance may change depending on community transmission rates and local contexts. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered: Vaccination rates: High vaccination rates in the eligible population can help reduce the severity of the disease and lower hospitalization rates. New variants: The emergence of new variants can impact the effectiveness of vaccines and previous immunity, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations. Community transmission: Higher community transmission rates can result in a greater number of infections and subsequently higher hospitalization rates. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of the healthcare system to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients can impact hospitalization rates and outcomes. Adherence to precautions: The extent to which individuals follow public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, can influence hospitalization rates. By considering these factors and monitoring local data and guidelines, parents and public health officials can make informed decisions to help forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Mental health and COVID-19: Here’s why the pandemic was harder on struggling Canadians - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Canadians with pre-existing mental health struggles, according to a recent report from Statistics Canada. Those with mental health difficulties were more likely to experience emotional distress, financial problems, and loneliness or isolation. The report classified individuals into three mental health profiles and found that over 25% had low-to-moderate mental health difficulties, while nearly 9% had severe difficulties. Since the pandemic began, suicide ideation has increased among those with mental health difficulties, with one in five of those with severe difficulties contemplating suicide. Income, work, and poverty are "social determinants" that contribute to the vulnerability of this population. Canadians who are visible minorities or living in northern, Indigenous, or poverty-stricken communities may have limited access to mental health support, exacerbating the problem. To improve their mental well-being, Canadians are encouraged to practice self-care and utilize online and local mental health resources. Waitlists for professional help can be long, so maintaining healthy routines and natural antidepressants like regular sleep, physical activity, and positive socialization are important. Loneliness and excessive screen time are also factors that can impact mental health.
