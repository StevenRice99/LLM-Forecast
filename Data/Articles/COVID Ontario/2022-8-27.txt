Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the upcoming rollout of new COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses in Canada, which is relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting include: The expected availability of bivalent vaccines targeting both the original strain and Omicron variants in Canada this fall. Mixed messaging on booster doses across the country, which may lead to "vaccine fatigue" and impact booster uptake. Data showing that a third dose offers significant protection against infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, but the benefit of a fourth dose is less clear for those under 60. The importance of clear messaging on vaccine protection and ease of access to booster shots to increase vaccination rates. Varying opinions on booster doses among Canadians, with some believing there is no immediate urgency and others thinking there is no need to expand booster eligibility. The potential for an uptick in cases this fall to drive people to get a booster dose, but this depends on the vaccine's effectiveness against emerging strains.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Oakville and across the province have decreased, with the province's chief doctor announcing that the seventh wave has peaked. Vaccination rates in Halton Region and Ontario are high, with 95% of Halton residents and 90.19% of eligible Ontarians having received at least one dose. The number of people in ICU and hospitals with COVID-19 has decreased, with 137 people in ICU and 1,328 people in hospitals with COVID-19. Test positivity is 14.7%, up slightly from last week's rate of 13.4%. The total number of cases in Ontario is 1.4 million, with 13,872 deaths reported. These values suggest that the current trend of decreasing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths may continue, and that vaccination rates are high, which could help mitigate the spread of the virus and reduce hospitalizations. However, the slight increase in test positivity rate may indicate a potential for future increases in cases and hospitalizations.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it provides real-world evidence of the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine in preventing severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalizations. The study found that: Primary series vaccination with BBIBP-CorV was 89% effective against serious or critical COVID-19 hospitalization among all age groups. Among working-age adults, 2-dose VE against serious/critical COVID-19 hospitalization was 96%. Among older adults, 2-dose VE was 53%. Adjusted VE was slightly higher among females than males. There were no serious/critical COVID-19 hospitalizations for any booster-dose recipients, regardless of age. These findings can inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly with regards to the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing severe outcomes. The study's results can also inform decision-making around vaccination strategies, including the importance of booster doses, especially for older adults.
