Title: Real-world study of the effectiveness of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) COVID-19 vaccine in the Kingdom of Morocco - BMC Public Health
Publisher: BMC Public Health

2-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious or critical COVID-19 hospitalization was 96% among working-age adults and 53% among older adults.
The Alpha variant was prevalent during the study period.
VE against severe disease varied by age group and vaccine type: 96.4% for individuals < 60 years, 53.3% for individuals 60 years and older (for BBIBP-CorV), and 70-90% among older adults (for Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines).
Waning protection requires booster vaccination to sustain protection.
The study has limitations: no analyses of virus strains, lack of data on comorbidities and other characteristics of the study population, and inability to distinguish hospitalization caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection from hospitalization coincidental to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
