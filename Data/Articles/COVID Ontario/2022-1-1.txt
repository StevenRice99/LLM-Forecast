This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: A study by Public Health Ontario found that the risk of hospitalization or death from Omicron is 54% lower compared to Delta, after adjusting for vaccination status and region. Despite this, the agency warns that the absolute number of hospitalizations and impact on the healthcare system is likely to be significant due to Omicron's higher transmissibility. Ontario reported 13,807 new COVID-19 cases, a record high. Quebec's research institute predicts significant growth in new hospitalizations and ICU occupancy over the next three weeks, with a potential 1,600-2,100 COVID-19 patients outside ICU and 300-375 ICU patients. The Public Health Agency of Canada reports an average of 1,892 people with COVID-19 being treated in Canadian hospitals each day, a 23% increase from the previous week. Ontario's chief medical officer of health announced changes to PCR testing and isolation periods, which may impact hospitalization rates. These values suggest that while the severity of Omicron may be lower, its high transmissibility and the resulting surge in cases could still lead to significant hospitalizations and healthcare system strain in Ontario.
