The article discusses how a group of international medical researchers is investigating the role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) in causing severe cases of COVID-19. NETs are web-like structures released by white blood cells called neutrophils to trap and kill bacteria, but they can also cause damage to the lungs and other organs in cases of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is a late and difficult-to-manage stage of COVID-19 infection. The consortium of researchers, called the NETwork, proposes that excess NETs may play a significant role in the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. If this hypothesis is confirmed through further studies, it could lead to new treatment avenues for COVID-19 patients using existing treatments for other NET and neutrophil-driven diseases. This may reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and improve patient outcomes. The article also highlights the institutions involved in the NETwork and provides an overview of their respective contributions to biomedical research.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic: School closures and the online preparedness of children
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article from Statistics Canada examines the potential impact of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic on children's academic progress, focusing on online learning and the preparedness of students. While only a small percentage of households with children (1.2%) lack internet access, there are disparities across income levels, with 4.2% of households in the bottom 25% of income distribution without internet compared to 0.2% in the top 25%. The number and type of internet-enabled devices in a household can also impact learning, as increased demand for devices among family members may limit access. Overall, 58.4% of households with internet access have less than one device per member. Income disparities exist here as well, with 63.0% of the lowest-income households having less than one device per member compared to 56.2% of the highest-income households. The quality of online learning is influenced by the types of devices available. Mobile devices like smartphones are more commonly used for receiving information, and 24.1% of the lowest-income households rely solely on these devices for internet access, compared to 8.0% of the highest-income households. School closures may result in reduced instructional time for students, which, according to a previous Statistics Canada study, can negatively impact academic performance. The study found that students who received one less year of instruction performed about 5% worse on standardized tests. The impact was more significant for youth from lower-income families. In conclusion, while online learning resources can help mitigate the effects of school closures, disparities in internet access and device availability across income levels may exacerbate existing inequalities. These factors could impact the quality and quantity of instruction, particularly affecting students from lower-income households. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is essential to consider the indirect consequences of school closures and the potential strain on healthcare systems resulting from the disrupted education and development of children.

Title: Changing travel trends during COVID-19
Publisher: City of Calgary Newsroom
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Calgary activated its Municipal Emergency Plan and began collecting travel data to understand the impact of physical distancing and closures on transportation. The data reveals a decrease in traffic, particularly on roads leading to downtown Calgary, with a 60% decline. However, roads serving industrial areas have seen a lesser decrease, highlighting the continued operation of essential businesses. Interestingly, the number of heavy trucks has remained consistent, emphasizing the importance of supply chains. To accommodate Calgarians' outdoor activities while maintaining physical distance, The City's Transportation Department closed lanes on select roadways, creating "adaptive roadways." Ekke Kok, Manager of Transportation Data and Forecasting, emphasizes the importance of monitoring the transportation system to ensure its effectiveness and to identify future travel behavior trends post-pandemic. The City of Calgary will continue to collect and analyze travel data to support essential services and provide a safe transportation network. The historical traffic data is available through the CalTRACS online tool, with a detailed report on March travel trends accessible at Calgary.ca/transportationdata. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the consistent flow of heavy trucking traffic indicates that supply chains are intact, which can help ensure access to essential medical supplies and equipment. However, the increase in pathway network usage and "adaptive roadways" may impact hospitalization rates if physical distancing measures are not effectively maintained.

Title: WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 13 April 2020
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The WHO is advising countries to consider six criteria before lifting social and economic restrictions put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic. These criteria are: 1. Evidence that COVID-19 transmission is controlled 2. Health system capacity to detect, test, isolate, and treat every case, and trace every contact 3. Minimized outbreak risks in special settings like health facilities and nursing homes 4. Implementation of preventive measures in workplaces, schools, and essential places 5. Managed importation risks 6. Educated, engaged, and empowered communities to adjust to the "new norm". The WHO emphasizes that control measures must be lifted slowly and with caution, as the way down in terms of case numbers is much slower than the way up. They also highlight the importance of protecting human rights and assessing each country's unique situation while prioritizing the most vulnerable populations. Some key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations include: COVID-19 spreads rapidly and is 10 times deadlier than the 2009 flu pandemic. The virus spreads more easily in crowded environments like nursing homes. Cases are doubling every 3 to 4 days in some countries. While COVID-19 accelerates quickly, it decelerates slowly, hence the need for gradual easing of restrictions. Preventive measures and contact tracing capacity are crucial for managing the pandemic. The development and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine will ultimately be necessary to fully interrupt transmission. In the meantime, a balanced approach is needed, addressing mortality caused by COVID-19, the impact on health systems, and socioeconomic consequences.

Title: COVID-19 in Quebec: A timeline of key dates and events
Publisher: CTV News Montreal
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Quebec's COVID-19 timeline began on February 27, 2020, with its first presumptive case, and the province quickly took action to combat the spread. By March, quarantine units were set up, and screening clinics opened as cases rose. The province advised travelers to self-isolate and canceled large events, while schools, daycares, and universities closed for 14 days. The focus was also on public transit, with Air Canada canceling flights and Montreal enhancing cleaning protocols. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, and Quebec's cases reached triple digits by March 25, with the first death in Montreal. The city declared a state of emergency to aid the homeless population. Checkpoints were installed, and non-essential travel was discouraged. By the end of March, Quebec cases surpassed 2,800, and there was a rise in racism toward Asian-Quebecers. The first COVID-19-related death was recorded on March 18. The month ended with a focus on seniors' residences and long-term care facilities, with the government announcing testing for staff and deploying additional medical personnel. In early April, the province passed 4,600 cases, and deaths surpassed 100. The month saw a crackdown on gatherings, with police issuing fines. Deaths and cases continued to rise, with a significant jump in deaths on April 3, including the first person under 40. Summer events were canceled, and the Canadian Armed Forces were called in to assist in long-term care facilities. Montreal announced a mobile medical clinic for the vulnerable population. By April 21, Quebec passed 1,000 deaths and 20,000 cases, with over 100 inmates and 90 employees testing positive in federal prisons. In late April, a patients' group filed a complaint regarding long-term care centers, alleging discrimination and exploitation of the elderly. The province's confirmed cases surpassed 21,000, with over 1,200 deaths. Quebec held its first-ever virtual parliamentary session. By April 26, COVID-19 deaths exceeded 1,500, and the health ministry recommended face coverings in public places. On April 27, the province announced a gradual reopening plan for daycares and elementary schools starting on May 11. Quebec also outlined a strategy to restart the economy, with construction, retail, and manufacturing resuming in May with restrictions. By the end of April, former Montreal Canadien Georges Laraque shared his COVID-19 diagnosis, and the death toll surpassed 2,000. In early May, the focus shifted to Montreal, with the city closing parking lots and parks as cases surpassed 30,000. The first outbreak in a daycare was reported in Mascouche, and a report warned of potential spikes in deaths if physical distancing measures were lifted. An outbreak at a meat processing plant in Chambly caused temporary closure, mirroring an incident at an Alberta plant. As of May 11, Quebec schools began to reopen, marking a significant milestone in the province's COVID-19 timeline. The province's proactive measures, including quarantines, screening clinics, and gradual reopening, aimed to curb the spread and protect its citizens.

Title: How the Spanish flu compares to COVID-19: Lessons learned, answers still being pursued
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn comparisons to the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. While there are similarities in the public health response to both outbreaks, there are also significant differences. Here are some key facts and forecasts related to COVID-19 hospitalizations: COVID-19 and the Spanish flu were both caused by novel viruses, meaning there were no treatments, vaccines, or prior exposure, resulting in no immunity. In both pandemics, there was confusion and mixed messaging about the effectiveness of masks and other preventive measures. The Spanish flu arrived in Canada on troop ships returning from Europe and spread across the country by rail. COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread globally, with the first death in Canada reported on March 9, 2020. Similar broad measures were implemented in both outbreaks, including bans on gatherings, closures of schools, churches, and non-essential businesses, and limits on public transportation. A significant difference is the closure of workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not occur during the Spanish flu. Governments have also provided economic support to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was not the case in 1918-1919. The global health system, including the World Health Organization, plays a crucial role in the COVID-19 response, which did not exist during the Spanish flu pandemic. Maintaining strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 as isolation measures drag on is a challenge, as was the case during the Spanish flu. The Spanish flu pandemic occurred in three waves: a mild first wave in spring 1918, a highly contagious and deadly second wave in fall 1918, and a more lethal third wave in winter 1919. As of April 10, 2020, there were over 1.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 98,000 deaths. In Canada, there were over 21,000 confirmed cases and over 540 deaths. The public health response to COVID-19 is evolving as more is learned about the disease, and officials are preparing for potential future waves.
