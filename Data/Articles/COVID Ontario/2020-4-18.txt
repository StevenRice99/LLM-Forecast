Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it highlights the importance of collecting race-based data to understand the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations, such as Indigenous communities, racialized populations, and those with low income. The article notes that these populations are more likely to have chronic diseases, which can increase their risk of severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Marginalized populations, such as Indigenous communities, racialized populations, and those with low income, are more likely to have chronic diseases and be at higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19. The lack of race-based data collection in Canada makes it difficult to understand the impact of COVID-19 on these populations and to develop targeted interventions. In the US, data has shown that black and Latino residents are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with higher rates of hospitalization and death. Ontario's chief medical officer of health has stated that the province does not plan to collect race-based data, citing privacy concerns. Health-care advocates and professionals are calling for the collection of race-based data to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations and to develop targeted interventions. Overall, this article highlights the need for more nuanced data collection and analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different populations in Ontario, Canada, and to develop effective strategies to mitigate these impacts.
