Title: Why the delta variant is spreading COVID-19 so quickly — and what that means for Canada
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The highly contagious Delta variant, first discovered in India in late 2020, has become the dominant strain in Canada and other countries, causing a rapid increase in infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has labeled Delta a "variant of concern," with an estimated 50% higher transmission rate than the Alpha variant, which was already 50% more contagious than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. This means each infected person can infect more people, causing the variant to spread quickly, especially among those with naive immune systems. While the exact mechanism behind its increased transmissibility is not fully understood, early research suggests mutations in the spike protein may evade cellular immunity and increase infectivity. Regarding vaccine efficacy, the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines have shown promising results. A recent study found that two doses of Pfizer were 88% effective against Delta, while two shots of AstraZeneca were 67% effective. Additionally, data from Israel showed that the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of severe disease by 91% and hospitalization by 88%. While breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals may occur, vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In the United States, the Delta variant accounts for over 80% of new infections, with unvaccinated individuals making up nearly 97% of severe cases. The situation in Africa is also concerning, as low vaccination rates and the spread of Delta are overwhelming hospital systems. In Canada, there are signs that Delta could lead to another surge in cases, especially in provinces like Alberta, where restrictions are being lifted despite rising infections. However, experts remain hopeful that Canada can avoid the most dire outcomes, as nearly six in 10 Canadians are fully vaccinated, and many continue to wear masks and take precautions.

Title: Public transit in a post-COVID-19 Canada
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transit ridership and how it relates to the number of people working from home in Canada. It uses data from Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Monthly Passenger Bus and Urban Transit Survey to analyze these relationships. There is a strong negative correlation between the proportion of people working from home and transit ridership, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.94. This indicates that as more people work from home, transit ridership decreases. Regional differences exist, with Atlantic Canada maintaining higher ridership levels (over 40% of pre-pandemic levels) and higher proportions of workers commuting to work. Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta had higher proportions of workers working from home and lower ridership levels. The industry also plays a role, with sectors like professional services and education having higher proportions of workers working from home, while sectors like manufacturing and accommodation have lower proportions. The future of public transit ridership is uncertain, and it may not return to pre-pandemic levels. Statistics Canada estimates that a full transition to telework could reduce commutes by public transit by up to 52%. Technology will play a dual role, encouraging working from home while also providing touchless solutions and health assurances for passengers. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not directly provide information on that. However, the data on the proportion of people working from home and transit ridership could be used as indicators or inputs in forecasting models. Higher rates of working from home may correlate with lower social contact rates and potentially lower infection rates, which could indirectly influence hospitalization forecasts.

Title: Extreme heat and COVID-19
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This document provides guidance for Canadian health authorities on protecting citizens from extreme heat while also considering the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points include: Extreme heat is a significant health risk in Canada, and climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused illnesses, deaths, and disruptions to communities. Public health authorities need to address both extreme heat and COVID-19 risks, especially for vulnerable populations. Fear of COVID-19 may cause people to avoid cooling shelters or treatment for heat-related illnesses. Proper public health and infection control measures must be implemented in cooling centers to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Extreme heat events may strain healthcare and community services already impacted by the pandemic. Relative risks from heat and COVID-19 vary locally and change over time. Health authorities should consider COVID-19's impact on extreme heat vulnerabilities. Vulnerable populations include the elderly, people with disabilities or mental illness, those in congregate settings, and those without access to temperature-controlled environments or air conditioning. Similarities between heat illness and COVID-19 symptoms can make diagnosis challenging. Health equity considerations are crucial, especially for at-risk populations, in planning and adapting public health interventions. Public health measures such as Heat Alert and Response Systems (HARS) can save lives, but the COVID-19 context may affect their effectiveness. Health authorities should review and adapt heat health programming considering health equity, air conditioning access, cooling centers, communications, healthcare delivery, and the built environment. Engagement with at-risk populations, including Indigenous communities, is essential to identify unique risks and develop appropriate solutions.

Title: WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 – 30 July 2021
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) to address it. Here is a summary: COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to climb globally, with the highly transmissible Delta variant detected in 132 countries and driving the increase in infections. WHO warns that the COVID-19 virus is constantly changing, and four variants of concern have emerged so far. The rise in cases is also attributed to increased social mixing, inconsistent public health measures, and inequitable vaccine distribution. The increased number of infections is overwhelming health systems and causing a shortage of treatments like oxygen in many countries. WHO is supporting countries with oxygen supplies and guidance to detect variants. WHO has set up a technology transfer hub for mRNA vaccines in South Africa to scale up vaccine production and achieve its goal of vaccinating 10% of each country's population by September 2021, 40% by the end of 2021, and 70% by mid-2022. However, vaccine distribution remains unjust, with less than 2% of all doses administered in Africa. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is launching the Rapid ACT-Accelerator Delta Response (RADAR) and calling for $7.7 billion for tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO emphasizes the need for stronger surveillance, strategic testing, early clinical care, well-protected health workers, and research to ensure that tools remain effective against the Delta variant. The organization also highlights the importance of its country offices in supporting health system strengthening and improving population health. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of the Delta variant, the vaccination rate, and the availability of medical resources like oxygen and protective equipment for healthcare workers. The RADAR initiative aims to address the urgent need for increased testing, treatments, and vaccines to mitigate the impact of the Delta variant and prevent further hospitalizations and deaths.

Title: Good oral health reduces risk of fatal outcomes from COVID-19
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
A recent study led by McGill University researchers has found a link between gum disease and increased complications from COVID-19, including higher rates of ICU admission, ventilator usage, and death. COVID-19 patients with gum disease were found to be 3.5 times more likely to be admitted to intensive care, 4.5 times more likely to require ventilation, and 8.8 times more likely to die compared to those without gum disease. The study, which analyzed dental and medical records of 568 patients in Qatar between February and July 2020, also revealed significantly higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with gum disease, suggesting that the inflammation caused by untreated gum disease can spread throughout the body and exacerbate the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 cases. This research highlights the importance of oral health in preventing and managing COVID-19 complications, as gum disease is a preventable condition through good oral hygiene practices and regular dental check-ups. Periodontitis, or gum disease, is a common dental problem in Canadians, affecting 70% of the population to some degree, and has been linked to various oral and systemic diseases. The study's findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the impact of periodontal health on overall health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 spreading faster in Alberta than during peak of 3rd wave
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Health experts in Alberta, Canada, are raising concerns about the alarming growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the province, outpacing the third wave of the pandemic. The R-value, indicating the number of people infected by each infected person, has doubled in recent weeks to 1.48. This means 100 infected people will spread the virus to 148 others, leading to exponential growth and the potential for a large surge in cases. The situation is made more urgent by the presence of the highly infectious Delta variant. Of particular concern is the relatively high number of unvaccinated individuals in Alberta, with 35.8% of the total population (including children under 12) unvaccinated, providing fuel for the virus to spread. Experts predict that most new cases will occur among the unvaccinated, who face a significantly higher risk of severe outcomes compared to those who are vaccinated. The lifting of public health restrictions and reduced mask-wearing are likely contributing to the increased spread. With contact tracing efforts also downsized, understanding and containing this potential new wave may become more challenging. While vaccination of older populations may help reduce mortality rates, experts are unsure how big the surge will get.

Posted: 3 days ago
University of Alberta engineering professor Rafiq Ahmad, in collaboration with a team of international researchers and students, has developed a personal protective respirator called PROPOS to protect front-line workers from COVID-19. The device combines a snorkeling mask with hoses connected to a battery-powered fan and filter system, including A95 filters provided by industry partner ACAMP. The project was led by master's student Emanuel Martínez Villanueva, who had previous experience designing air filters and fuel tanks in the automotive industry. The development of PROPOS was made possible through a partnership between the University of Alberta and Tecnológico de Monterrey (TEC) in Mexico, with the universities collaborating on research projects and student exchanges. The partnership has led to several joint research proposals in the areas of artificial intelligence and energy, with the first round of winners receiving funding to explore projects such as the role of affect in online higher education and the early detection of mental health disorders using machine learning. While the initial version of PROPOS is not yet approved for medical settings, Ahmad believes it could be useful in non-medical, essential industry, and educational settings. He is partnering with Flexcim Services, Alberta Innovates, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to mass-produce the device, with production hoped to start in September. The article also highlights the growing partnership between the University of Alberta and TEC, which serves 92,000 students across Mexico and is a strategic partner for the Canadian federal and provincial governments. The universities have collaborated on research projects, student exchanges, and public relations initiatives, with plans to expand undergraduate student mobility in the future. Regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or forecasts. However, the development of PROPOS demonstrates a proactive approach to protecting front-line workers and potentially reducing the burden on healthcare systems by preventing infections in high-risk individuals.

Title: Starting a business in a pandemic: The experiences of businesses created during COVID-19
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article examines business creation and associated employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. It finds that there were 112,764 new businesses, or "entrants," in 2020, a 5.4% decrease from the previous year. However, the majority of these businesses were created after the initial onset of the pandemic, with a 2.8% increase in entrants from June to December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Despite the increase in the number of entrants, the employment associated with these new businesses was lower than in 2019, indicating that the businesses created in 2020 were smaller on average. The article also highlights variations across industries and provinces. The largest increases in entrants were in professional services, information and cultural industries, and wholesale trade, while the number of entrants declined in industries such as accommodation and food services. At the provincial level, most provinces saw an increase in entrants, with the highest increase in British Columbia at 7.1%. However, the employment associated with these entrants was lower across all provinces and territories. The article concludes by discussing the contribution of entrants to overall employment dynamics in 2020. Entrants typically contribute about 30% of employment created, but their share declined slightly during the pandemic due to the smaller size of these businesses. The article also notes that growing businesses contributed the most to employment growth, while declining businesses led to significant job losses. Overall, the article provides insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business creation and employment in Canada, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of entrepreneurs during a challenging economic period.

Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article presents a multi-omics study of 231 hospitalized COVID-19 patients without selected comorbidities, aiming to identify biomarkers for disease severity and explore the underlying pathogenesis. The study included whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analyses. The key findings are summarized below: The study identified 14 genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity, including variants in the IFNAR2, TYK2, and OAS3 genes involved in the type I interferon pathway. Differential expression analysis of mRNA, protein, metabolite, and lipid levels revealed distinct patterns between mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that severe COVID-19 patients exhibited dysregulation in immune response, inflammation, and lipid metabolism pathways. A multi-omics integration approach identified key molecules and pathways associated with COVID-19 severity, including IL-6, TNF-, and interferon-related pathways. The study also constructed mRNA-miRNA and mRNA-lncRNA networks to explore post-transcriptional regulation in COVID-19. Overall, the study provides insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identifies potential biomarkers for disease severity, which may aid in risk stratification and targeted interventions. This study has several strengths, including the large sample size, multi-omics approach, and comprehensive data analysis. However, further validation in independent cohorts and functional studies are needed to confirm the findings.
