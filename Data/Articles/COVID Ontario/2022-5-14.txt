Title: Why COVID is a key suspect in severe hepatitis cases in kids worldwide
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The World Health Organization (WHO) is investigating at least 348 probable cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children worldwide, with more than a dozen possible cases reported in Canada alone. While the exact cause remains unknown, researchers are exploring a potential link to COVID-19. An American case study published in a pediatric journal analyzed a healthy three-year-old who developed acute liver failure after a mild COVID infection, suggesting that COVID may trigger an abnormal immune response that attacks the liver. Israeli and Indian research teams have also found COVID-19 to be a common factor among unexplained hepatitis cases in children. International health organizations are considering multiple possible causes, including adenovirus infection and co-infection or past infection with SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to determine the definitive cause and any potential links to COVID-19 or other factors. Physicians advise that parents seek medical attention if their child exhibits possible symptoms of hepatitis, including jaundice, dark urine, pale stool, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the aviation industry, particularly passenger airlines, with a 97% year-over-year decline in passengers in April 2020. Canadian Level I air carriers saw significant decreases in passengers, passenger-kilometers, and capacity, with a slow recovery throughout 2021. International flights were affected more than domestic flights due to stricter travel restrictions. Cargo transportation became more important during the pandemic, with carriers increasing fleet utilization and adding freighters to meet demand. Cargo revenue became a larger component of air carriers' revenue, with goods revenue accounting for 19%-44% of total operating revenue during the pandemic. Fixed costs, such as fuel and wages, contributed to financial losses for airlines despite reductions in passenger revenue. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered: Vaccination rates: Higher vaccination rates can reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections and lower hospitalization rates. Variants: New variants of the virus may be more transmissible or cause more severe illness, leading to increased hospitalizations. Public health measures: The effectiveness and adherence to public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, can impact hospitalization rates. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of the healthcare system to handle a surge in cases is crucial in managing hospitalizations. Seasonality: COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have shown seasonal patterns, with potential increases during winter months. Testing and contact tracing: Effective testing and contact tracing can help identify and isolate cases, reducing the spread and hospitalizations. Therapeutic treatments: The availability and effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19 can impact hospitalization rates and durations. By analyzing these factors and incorporating data on infection rates, hospitalization rates, and healthcare system capacity, forecasts can be made to estimate the expected number of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This information can help inform public health policies, resource allocation, and healthcare system preparedness.

Title: COVID-19 infections in infants
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the incidence, transmission, and symptoms of COVID-19 in infants, as well as the potential risk factors for severe disease. Here is a summary of the key points: The incidence of COVID-19 in children is estimated at 1-13% of all reported cases, with varying rates depending on the number of tests performed. Infants may be as susceptible to infection as adults, and the transmission time between children and adults in households is similar. Most infections in children are mild or asymptomatic, but severe cases have also been reported. Boys were more commonly infected than girls, and infants with COVID-19 often had fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease and diabetes are risk factors for severe COVID-19 in adults and children. Laboratory abnormalities in infants with COVID-19 include elevated CRP, PCT, D-dimers, and IL-6 levels. Management of mild to moderate COVID-19 in children involves outpatient care, adequate hydration, and antipyretic treatment. During the second wave of the pandemic, a higher proportion of infants were infected, and their hospital stays were longer due to more severe COVID-19 courses. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts may be important: The incidence of COVID-19 in infants can be underestimated due to mild and asymptomatic cases, and they may be prone to cross-contamination within households. Infants with COVID-19 are more likely to develop dyspnea and pneumonia compared to other pediatric age groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in infants than older children and may be the only symptom of COVID-19. During the second wave, a lower number of infections was documented due to contact with infected family members, suggesting increased viral infectivity. Complications from bacterial superinfections can lead to more severe COVID-19 courses and longer hospital stays.

Title: Researchers probe COVID-19’s uneven impact on racialized and immigrant communities in Peel Region
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a new study from the University of Toronto Mississauga that aims to understand the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Peel Region, Ontario, Canada. Peel Region emerged as a nationwide pandemic hotspot last year, and the study, "Understanding the COVID-19 Journeys and Vaccine Experiences of Racialized and Immigrant Communities in the Greater Toronto Area," seeks to illuminate why racialized populations in the region experienced relatively higher rates of virus exposure. The study consists of interviews with 69 community members from across Peel Region, asking about their experiences and how families and communities supported each other during the crisis. The research team, led by associate professor Tracey Galloway, is analyzing the data to identify themes that explain the pandemic's disproportionate burden on racialized communities. They also hope to learn about the roles of young adults in immigrant families in interpreting public health information and the sources of information people used to determine risky or safe behaviors related to COVID-19, particularly regarding vaccines. PhD student Amanda Norton used geospatial analysis to identify patterns of infection rates and their relationship to the racial and socio-economic makeup of affected communities. The overall goal of the study is to increase the efficacy of health messaging and care for racialized urban communities within Canada, with a focus on understanding how marginalized populations navigate life and informing community health programming, public health messaging, and addressing health inequities.

Title: Quebec using McGill lab to test wastewater for COVID-19
Publisher: McGill Reporter
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: McGill University's McConnell Engineering Building has been at the forefront of COVID-19 wastewater testing since the pandemic's onset. Led by Professor Dominic Frigon, the lab has been analyzing sewage water for traces of the coronavirus, providing a cost-effective way to detect infected individuals, including asymptomatic ones. The Quebec government has recognized the value of this initiative and will utilize the laboratory to conduct widespread wastewater testing in several regions over the next year. Wastewater testing for COVID-19 offers a rapid snapshot of viral circulation among the population, including those with intestinal problems associated with the virus. The project received initial funding from McGill and later secured additional support from the FRQNT and family foundations. The data provided valuable insights into the trajectory of the Omicron variant, influencing McGill's COVID-19 strategy. The demand for PCR tests during the Omicron wave overwhelmed testing centers, and daily case counts skyrocketed. As a result, the Health Ministry restricted PCR tests to priority populations, rendering daily case numbers less reliable. Journalists advocated for wastewater testing as a solution, and the Ministry partnered with Frigon's lab and l'Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) to enhance their testing capabilities. Federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos visited the lab, acknowledging the importance of their "lifesaving work" in the ongoing battle against COVID-19 and future pandemics. The Public Health Agency of Canada is also establishing a pan-Canadian wastewater testing network, creating committees to discuss sampling, analysis, variant detection, and epidemiology. Frigon's lab aims to expand wastewater testing for other purposes, such as antimicrobial resistance surveillance and seasonal flu monitoring.
