This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 trends are mostly stable or rising, with moderate to high levels of respiratory illnesses expected in the fall. Wastewater data shows a slow rise in coronavirus levels over the past two months, considered high by Ottawa Public Health (OPH). The average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 is stable at 27, with one patient in an ICU. The city's weekly average test positivity rate is about 19%, considered high by OPH. There are 26 active COVID outbreaks, mostly in care homes, and 163 new COVID cases reported in the last week. Eight more COVID deaths were reported, all among people aged 80 and above. Only 30% of Ottawa residents aged five and up have had a COVID vaccine in the last year. Updated booster doses are expected in early autumn. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa, and potentially in other parts of Ontario, may increase in the fall due to rising respiratory illnesses, high wastewater levels, and low vaccination rates.

Title: Covid is on the rise again, but it’s different now

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased in the US, from a low of 6,000 a week in early July to about 17,000 a week currently. Wastewater levels of SARS-CoV-2 have also increased steadily since mid-July. The Pirola variant, which was initially concerning due to its high number of mutations, has been found to be less transmissible and less susceptible to vaccine-induced protection than initially thought. The dominant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the US are currently related to the omicron variant, specifically the XBB branch, which is not associated with big waves of severe illness. The new COVID-19 vaccine expected to roll out in mid-September is well-positioned to target the XBB variants causing hospitalizations. COVID-19 transmission is constantly ebbing and flowing, with cases rising and falling every few months, likely due to population immunity rather than environmental factors or human behavior. Experts recommend getting vaccinated with the newly formulated COVID-19 vaccine, advocating for early treatment with antiviral medications like Paxlovid, and taking precautions such as wearing a mask in public to protect oneself and others from unnecessary illness. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Hospitalization rates Wastewater levels of SARS-CoV-2 Dominant strains of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine effectiveness against dominant strains Population immunity Transmission trends over time Note: While the article focuses on the US, the information on COVID-19 transmission trends, vaccine effectiveness, and dominant strains can be applied to Ontario, Canada, to inform forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Key points relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: The article mentions that COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising again across Canada. The hospital on Vancouver Island has seen 18 patients test positive for COVID-19, occupying nearly 30% of beds, with most patients being over 75 years old and vulnerable to COVID-19. The article highlights the concerns of healthcare workers about the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals and the need for enhanced measures to control the spread. The article mentions that Ontario reports 101 ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks as of August 26, which is relevant for forecasting hospitalizations in the province. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the current situation of COVID-19 spread in hospitals and the concerns of healthcare workers, which can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.

Title: Early lab tests suggest new COVID-19 variant BA.2.86 may be less contagious and less immune-evasive than feared
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the emergence of the BA.2.86 variant of the virus that causes COVID-19, which has spread to at least 11 countries, including the United States. The variant has more than 30 changes to its spike protein, making it significantly different from previous variants. However, early studies from China and Sweden suggest that the variant may not be as severe as initially thought, with a twofold drop in the ability of immunity from vaccination and recent infection to neutralize the virus, and a 60% lower infectiousness compared to XBB.1.5 viruses. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: BA.2.86 variant has spread to at least 11 countries, including the United States Early studies suggest a twofold drop in the ability of immunity from vaccination and recent infection to neutralize the virus BA.2.86 virus is about 60% less infectious than XBB.1.5 viruses Experts believe the variant will slowly circulate in the population and not compete with other fast-prevailing variants These values can inform forecasting models and help predict the potential impact of the BA.2.86 variant on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: More COVID cases are coming. Here's what you need to know
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
TRUE. This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Key indicators suggest Canadians may be entering a fall COVID-19 wave, with an increase in positive test cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and rising virus levels in wastewater across the country. The highly mutated new variant BA.2.86 has been detected in Canada for the first time. Health experts attribute the recent rise in infections to the spread of Omicron subvariant EG.5, which has been circulating in Canada since at least May and accounts for about 60% of current positive cases. Experts expect the return to school to bring an increase in viral spread, but do not anticipate mask mandates or lockdowns. The current increase in COVID-19 cases does not yet indicate a severe wave, but experts advise continued vaccination and masking to reduce the spread of the virus. New vaccines specifically designed to target the subvariant XBB.1.5 are expected mid-fall, and experts recommend waiting for these new vaccines before getting a booster. The wastewater monitoring project in Ottawa has seen a gradual increase in most variants over the past four weeks, with EG.5 outpacing the other variants. The increase in COVID-19 viruses in Ottawa's wastewater indicates the beginning of another wave, which is expected to continue for at least the next couple of months. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: The spread of Omicron subvariant EG.5 The detection of the highly mutated new variant BA.2.86 The increase in COVID-19 viruses in Ottawa's wastewater The expected return to school and increased viral spread The availability of new vaccines specifically designed to target the subvariant XBB.1.5 The continued importance of vaccination and masking to reduce the spread of the virus.
