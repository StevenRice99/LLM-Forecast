Title: Covid is on the rise again, but it’s different now
Publisher: Vox.com
Trusted: False

The article discusses the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 transmission, which is unlike other respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV that have seasonal patterns. Experts suggest that population immunity may be driving changes in COVID-19 transmission rather than weather or human behavior.
Some key points from the article include:
COVID-19 transmission rates seem to oscillate constantly, without a clear seasonal pattern.
Experts believe that population immunity is waning during periods of low transmission, leading to subsequent upticks in cases.
Human behavior, such as wearing masks and social distancing, may not be entirely responsible for the timing of these reoccurring upticks.
The article suggests that it's still important to protect oneself and others from unnecessary illness, especially for people at high risk of severe illness.
The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 when a new vaccine becomes available and advocating for early treatment with antiviral medications like Paxlovid.

The article discusses the current COVID-19 situation in Canada, where there has been a recent increase in cases due to the emergence of new variants such as EG.5 and XBB.1.2. Experts agree that this is not necessarily another wave of the pandemic, but rather an ongoing challenge.
Here are some key takeaways from the article:
Health experts do not expect mask mandates or lockdowns to be reinstated in response to the current COVID-19 situation.
The new vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax are expected to be more effective against the EG.5 variant and will likely become available mid-fall.
It is recommended to wait for these new vaccines before getting a booster shot, unless you have a substantial risk factor.
Continued vaccination is still important to prevent severe infections, even if current vaccines may not provide optimal protection against new variants.
Experts expect an increase in viral spread as children return to school, but this can also lead to increased circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and influenza.
Overall, the article suggests that while COVID-19 is still a concern, it is not expected to be as severe as previous waves.
