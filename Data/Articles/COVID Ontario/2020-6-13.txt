Trusted: False

Experts agree that hugs can spread COVID-19 through droplets or physical contact.
The risk of transmission increases when hugging people outside of one's immediate household or those at high-risk (e.g., older adults, grandparents).
Wearing masks, keeping the hug brief, facing away from each other, and holding your breath can reduce the risk of transmission.
However, not all experts agree on the safety of hugs, with some recommending avoiding them altogether.

Title: Survivors who missed out on polio vaccine hope for breakthrough against COVID-19

Trusted: False

Estimated 11,000 people in Canada were left paralyzed by polio between 1949 and 1954 (relevant for understanding population health trends).
Provincial public health officials closed some schools and restricted children from leaving their homes during polio epidemics (similar to measures taken during COVID-19 outbreaks).
Polio was transmitted primarily through ingestion of contaminated food or water, affecting breathing muscles in severe cases (relevance to respiratory transmission of COVID-19).
Ventilators used for COVID-19 patients remind Miki Boleen of mechanical respirators (iron lungs) used during polio epidemics (highlighting similarities between medical responses).
