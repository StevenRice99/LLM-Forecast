Title: One country, two pandemics: what COVID-19 reveals about inequality in Canada
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities in Canadian society, particularly among low-income and marginalized communities. Here are the key points: Data analyses from Montreal and Toronto showed strong correlations between higher rates of COVID-19 infections and low-income, predominantly Black, and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Public health officials in Ontario reported that infection and death rates from COVID-19 were disproportionately higher in diverse neighbourhoods, with hospitalization and death rates being four and two times higher, respectively. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist, attributed these disparities to working conditions that expose individuals to the virus and living situations with more people in smaller dwellings. The federal government's modelling highlighted vulnerabilities in long-term care centres and other "congregate settings" like prisons and shelters, where outbreaks have occurred. The pandemic has also brought to light the unequal suffering of marginalized communities, as seen in the record-high drug overdose deaths in British Columbia in May. The economic impact has disproportionately affected younger, low-wage, non-unionized, and female workers, particularly in public-facing sectors like retail and restaurants. The reopening of the economy risks exacerbating inequalities, as some workers return to vulnerable jobs or are unable to work due to childcare responsibilities. The sense of solidarity in the crisis is waning, with critics accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of hypocrisy for attending a large protest against anti-Black racism while advocating for physical distancing. The pandemic has exposed weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Canadian society, and the fight against COVID-19 underscores the message that a society is only as strong as its weakest link. The risks moving forward include squandering the progress made in suppressing the virus and forgetting the inequalities exposed during the crisis, requiring both immediate action and long-term systemic changes.

Title: The Best Global Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic, 1 Year Later
Publisher: TIME
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic response of several countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia, and highlights their successful strategies. Taiwan's early actions, aggressive monitoring, and use of technology like SIM-tracking contributed to its low case numbers. However, its success has led to a reduced sense of urgency around vaccination. Singapore's early and aggressive measures, including strict monitoring and the use of technology, have kept transmission rates low. The country has successfully reopened universities but faces criticism for inequality in its response, with most cases found in the migrant population. South Korea's proactive approach to small outbreaks and its population's compliance with testing, tracing, and quarantining measures have kept cases and fatalities low. However, South Korea's gamble on monoclonal antibody drugs over immediate vaccinations has been a significant misstep. New Zealand's quick and aggressive lockdown measures, consistent messaging, and strong political leadership have resulted in low COVID-19 numbers. Its vaccination rate, however, is a cause for concern. Australia's early measures to limit transmission and quick response to new cases have been effective. While its neighbor New Zealand has lower case numbers, Australia's response has been decent, and it is not falling too far behind in vaccination efforts. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts and strategies can be considered: Early and aggressive actions: Countries that responded early and aggressively, such as Taiwan, Singapore, and New Zealand, have been successful in keeping cases and hospitalizations low. Implementing measures like lockdowns, border controls, and strict monitoring can help reduce the spread and prevent hospitalizations. Testing, tracing, and quarantining: South Korea and New Zealand's emphasis on extensive testing, contact tracing, and isolation of confirmed cases have been key to their success. This strategy helps identify and contain outbreaks, reducing the strain on healthcare systems. Vaccination efforts: While low case numbers in some countries may have reduced the sense of urgency around vaccination, it is important to prioritize vaccination drives. As demonstrated by South Korea's misstep with monoclonal antibody drugs, relying solely on other treatments can be risky. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations. Addressing inequality: Singapore's experience highlights the importance of ensuring an equitable response. Targeted measures and support for vulnerable populations, such as migrant workers, are crucial to preventing outbreaks and reducing hospitalizations in these communities. Political leadership and coordination: Strong and coordinated political leadership, as seen in New Zealand and Australia, can play a crucial role in effective pandemic response. Clear and consistent messaging, along with trust in the government's handling of the crisis, can facilitate public compliance with health measures and vaccination efforts. By learning from the successes and challenges of these countries, policymakers can adapt their strategies and make informed decisions to forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations in their respective contexts.

Title: How class and race are playing into COVID-19 restrictions and access to leisure
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized communities in Canada, particularly the closure of recreational facilities and the policing of sports fields and courts. The loss of access to leisure activities has had a significant impact on the mental health and sense of community for many people, especially those without alternative options such as backyards or club memberships. The article also highlights the racial and social inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, as activities like golf and tennis, which are predominantly enjoyed by upper-class white individuals, were prioritized in the reopening plan over activities popular among marginalized communities, such as cricket and basketball. The closure of community centers and youth programs has also disrupted vital support systems for at-risk youth, potentially impacting their health and well-being. Some important facts to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include: COVID-19 has disproportionately affected marginalized populations in Canada, including immigrants, racialized communities, and low-income earners. The closing of recreational facilities and policing of sports fields have prevented people from engaging in leisure activities, impacting their mental and emotional health. Fines for contravening COVID-19 rules have been issued, with half of the fines in Toronto given for the use of park amenities such as sports fields and courts. The reopening of recreational facilities has prioritized activities enjoyed by upper-class and white individuals, while activities popular among marginalized communities have been restricted. Community centers and youth programs provide essential support for at-risk youth, and their closure can have negative consequences for the health and well-being of these individuals. Marginalized communities may face greater challenges in accessing healthcare and adhering to public health measures, potentially impacting hospitalization rates. These factors should be considered when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as they may influence the rate of infection and the ability of marginalized communities to access healthcare services.

Title: Our COVID-19 response: Keeping markets liquid
Publisher: Bank of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article discusses the concept of market liquidity, which refers to the ease and speed of buying and selling assets. Liquidity can be assessed by considering the necessary discount on an asset's price to facilitate a quick sale. Illiquid assets, like houses, incur higher transaction costs and may take longer to sell, requiring a significant price reduction for a faster sale. On the other hand, financial assets like Government of Canada bonds are highly liquid and considered safe investments that influence lending rates. This concept of liquidity is essential for understanding the efficiency and stability of financial markets and the broader economy.

Title: COVID-19 and job displacement: Thinking about the longer term
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on job displacement and losses in Canada. While it is too early to know the exact number of job losses, the article presents some facts and trends from past recessions to provide context. Since February 2020, the average monthly layoff rate in Canada has been 12.4%, much higher than the 2.5-3.5% range during the first two months of previous downturns. Young workers, less educated workers, and recently hired workers have been more likely to be laid off during past recessions, and this trend appears to be continuing. During the last three recessions in 1981-1982, 1990-1992, and 2008-2009, about 45% of laid-off workers were permanently laid off, while the rest experienced temporary layoffs. However, many of those temporarily laid off also lost their jobs in the following year. Job loss can have long-term earnings impacts, with at least one in five permanently laid-off workers experiencing a decline in real earnings even five years after job loss. The article also highlights several factors that could influence the longer-term impact of the pandemic on Canadian workers, such as consumption expenditures, exports, investment, firm entry and closure, automation, telework, and online sales capacity. It is currently unknown how many job losses will occur and how displaced workers will fare financially in the long term. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the potential scale of permanent layoffs resulting from the pandemic to anticipate its longer-term effects on Canadian workers.

Title: Systemic Inequities Increase Covid-19 Risk for Indigenous People in Canada
Publisher: Human Rights Watch
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Canada's public health officials are cautiously optimistic about containing Covid-19, but they recognize the heightened risk for Indigenous communities due to systemic inequities and discrimination. These communities face challenges such as limited access to clean water, overcrowded housing, and higher rates of underlying health conditions, making social distancing and handwashing difficult and putting them at increased risk of infection. Indigenous people also face discrimination in healthcare access, especially in remote Northern communities with ill-equipped and understaffed nursing stations. The government has taken steps to address concerns but deeper reforms are needed to dismantle barriers to healthcare and ensure equitable distribution of supplies like PPE. Involving Indigenous people in creating solutions that respect their rights is crucial to reducing the pandemic's impact and ensuring healthier futures for these communities. Climate change, which impacts access to food in remote Indigenous communities, and food insecurity exacerbated by Covid-19 are additional concerns.

Title: A GBA+ case for understanding the impact of COVID-19
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article argues that Canada needs to better understand the relationship between identity and health in the COVID-19 era, and that intersectional analysis and the use of the Gender-Based Analysis plus (GBA+) tool can help achieve this. GBA+ is an approach that considers sex, gender, race, ability, and age to assess how policies impact different groups, with the goal of creating equitable policies. While there is no set formula for GBA+, it relies on disaggregated data to identify patterns of discrimination and guide policy change. The authors argue that GBA+ should have been applied to the government's COVID-19 response to ensure equitable outcomes for all identity groups. They highlight that several Western countries have found links between social determinants of health (race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status) and infection, hospitalization, and death rates, but Canada has not collected data on these factors. This gap in data collection will hinder the country's ability to control the spread of the virus and understand its long-term impacts. The article also discusses the importance of considering racial discrimination as a determinant of chronic diseases and the need to distinguish between Canadian-born visible minorities and those who are immigrants in health data. By embracing GBA+ and intersectional analysis, policymakers can better assess the toll of the pandemic and create more equitable policies.

Title: Reimagining the office and work life after COVID-19
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to adapt to remote work, and employees have enjoyed the flexibility and lack of commute. Organizations are now reconsidering the role of the office and how to balance remote work with in-person collaboration. Four steps are recommended for reimagining work and workplaces: reconstructing how work is done, deciding between "people to work" or "work to people," redesigning the workplace to support organizational priorities, and resizing the office footprint creatively. The article suggests that organizations should take a transformational approach to reinventing offices and question long-held assumptions about the role of the office. The goal is to create a safe, productive, and enjoyable work environment that leverages the benefits of both in-person and remote work. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction. However, it does mention that organizations will need to manage employee safety in the office, including physical distancing, mask-wearing, and airflow considerations, until a vaccine becomes widely available. This suggests that COVID-19 hospitalizations will continue to be a factor in workplace decision-making for the foreseeable future.

Title: Asian communities across Canada report rising racist behaviour during COVID-19 crisis - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the increase in acts of racism against Asian communities in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization believes COVID-19 originated in China, and the disease has affected more than six million people worldwide, with nearly 400,000 deaths. Asian individuals in Canada, regardless of their specific ethnic background, have faced discrimination and even hate crimes as a result of the pandemic. Trixie Ling, a resident of Vancouver, shared her experience of being verbally assaulted and spat on by a young white man, showcasing the blatant racism that has emerged. The Vancouver Police Department has reported a 600% increase in hate crimes targeting the Asian community. While some organizations, like British Columbia's Anti-Racism Network, believe that racism has always been prevalent and that people are now more open about expressing their racist views, others, like Sandra Hyde, a professor at McGill University, attribute it to people's fear and desire to place blame during a pandemic with no cure or vaccine. Hyde's research highlights how the "yellow peril" trope has been used to target Chinese immigrants in Canada during health scares, such as the 2003 SARS crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated reference to COVID-19 as the "China Virus" has also normalized racist discourse. In response to the rising racism, B.C.'s Lt.-Gov. Janet Austin has launched an anti-racism campaign on Twitter called "Different Together," which aims to celebrate diversity and quell hate. Anti-racism advocates support the initiative but call for mandatory anti-racism workshops in schools and workplaces. Individuals like Ling and Andy Sue, a flower shop owner in Toronto, are determined to speak out against systemic racism and turn the pandemic into a cultural war.
