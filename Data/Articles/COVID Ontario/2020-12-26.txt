Here is a brief summary of the key points: Hospitalizations in Ontario have increased by 74% and ICU admissions have increased by 80% in recent weeks. COVID-19-related hospitalizations have increased by 74% in the last four weeks, and ICU admissions for virus-related complications have more than doubled in that time. The health system is nearing capacity, with thousands of elective surgeries already backlogged and the possibility of canceling more. The province is implementing a shutdown, with restrictions on gatherings, businesses, and schools, in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. The shutdown will last for 14 days in northern Ontario and 28 days in southern Ontario. The premier is also calling on the federal government to close borders to mitigate the spread of the virus from travelers.

Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here's a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: A COVID-19 outbreak occurred at a dentist's office in Pembroke, Renfrew County, with 3 staff members testing positive. The outbreak is attributed to a visitor from a locked-down part of Ontario (Grey-Lockdown zone), highlighting the risk of travel-related transmission. The Renfrew County and District Health Unit (RCDHU) is currently in the "Green-Prevent" zone, the lowest level of restrictions, but surrounding health units are in higher restriction levels (Yellow-Protect or Orange-Restrict). The article mentions specific regions in Ontario that are in the "Grey-Lockdown" zone (Toronto, York Region, Peel Region, and Windsor-Essex) and Hamilton will be moving to lockdown on Monday. These points are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as they indicate: 1. The potential for outbreaks in areas with lower restriction levels (Green-Prevent) due to travel-related transmission. 2. The need to monitor areas with higher restriction levels (Yellow-Protect, Orange-Restrict, and Grey-Lockdown) for potential increases in hospitalizations. 3. The importance of tracking movement and travel patterns within the province to anticipate potential hotspots and outbreaks.

Title: COVID-19 vaccines are an 'astonishing' feat, but they won't end pandemic overnight
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions across Canada have risen higher this month than at any point in the pandemic, with Ontario hitting a trend of more than 2,000 cases per day for the first time. Quebec has almost 1,000 COVID-19 patients in hospital, and Alberta reported its highest number of deaths in a single day. Despite the arrival of vaccines, politicians and public health officials are pleading with Canadians to continue to follow guidelines and avoid gathering during the holiday season, as it could be many months before the impact of the vaccines is felt. The initial vaccine doses may not put an immediate stop to the virus, and it may take until the second wave of vaccinations (April, May, June) to see a significant impact on hospitalization and death rates. Canada will receive a combined total of six million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, which will be distributed to a total of three million Canadians. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada are likely to remain high in the short term, despite the arrival of vaccines, and that continued public health measures and caution are necessary to slow the spread of the virus.
