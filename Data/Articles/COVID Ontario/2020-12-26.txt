It seems like you're providing an article about the current situation with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada. Here are some key points summarized from the text:
The provincial government has announced a lockdown effective December 26, but many health officials and hospital associations are calling for stricter measures to be implemented sooner.
Hospitals in regions such as Peel and Brampton are facing unsustainable pressures on front-line staff and capacity issues due to rising COVID-19 admissions.
Dr. Naveed Mohammad, CEO of the William Osler Health System, urged people to act as if the lockdown started immediately, noting that hospitals are already at capacity and can't handle a surge in cases.
The Ontario Hospital Association (OHA) expressed disappointment with the delay in implementing new measures, citing concerns about confusing messages and increased risks for residents.
As of December 21, there were over 19,000 confirmed active cases of COVID-19 in Ontario, a record high. The province reported 17 more deaths related to the virus, bringing the total toll to 4,167.
The test positivity rate was 4.7 per cent, and nearly half of ICU beds at one Scarborough hospital were taken up by COVID-19 patients last week.
The Ministry of Education reported 154 new school-related cases, with over 20% of Ontario's schools having at least one case of COVID-19.
The article also mentions a joint statement from hospitals in the GTA and the OHA, expressing concerns about the strain on health-care workers and the need for stricter measures to prevent further transmission. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) is calling on the government to consider tightening restrictions on elementary schools when they reopen.

Title: COVID-19 vaccines are an 'astonishing' feat, but they won't end pandemic overnight
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article highlights several points relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Ontario has hit a trend of more than 2,000 cases per day, which could lead to increased hospitalizations.
The province is experiencing a surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions across the country, with numbers higher than at any point in the pandemic.
Deaths haven't been this high since May, indicating a concerning trend.
The arrival of two COVID-19 vaccines may provide hope for an end to the pandemic, but it could take many months before their impact is felt.
To slow down the spread, a significant number of Canadians (about 20 million) need to be vaccinated with two doses each, which is a massive task.
