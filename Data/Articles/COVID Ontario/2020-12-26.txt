Title: COVID-19 The Science of Testing
Publisher: Alberta Health Services
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Alberta's COVID-19 testing program is crucial for tracking and preventing the spread of the virus. Alberta Precision Laboratories (APL) leads the testing efforts and processes thousands of tests daily. The primary testing methods are Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing and rapid point-of-care testing. PCR testing is highly sensitive and detects tiny amounts of the virus's genetic material. It involves sample collection, an extraction process, amplification, and result notification. Rapid point-of-care testing provides faster results, reducing transmission in communities and is useful in rural and remote areas. Rapid antigen and molecular tests are simple tests that provide results within hours. APL also conducts genetic sequencing and variant screening to monitor the evolution of the virus and identify Variants of Concern, such as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. All COVID-19 testing methods can detect known strains, but additional testing is needed to identify specific variants. Serology testing, which detects antibodies in the blood, is used for surveillance and research to assess exposure and inform medical treatment decisions. It is not available to the general public and must be approved by provincial experts. Regarding forecasting hospitalizations, while the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction, the availability and accuracy of testing play a crucial role in understanding the spread of the virus and guiding public health measures. The early and accurate detection of infections through testing can help identify those who need medical care and support contact tracing efforts. Additionally, genetic sequencing and variant screening provide valuable information on the evolution of the virus and the emergence of new variants, which can impact the severity of infections and hospitalizations.

Posted: 3 days ago
CUPE, a union representing workers in various sectors across Canada, has released a guide to address the COVID-19 immunization program and its impact on members' rights and health and safety. The pandemic has affected CUPE members significantly, with many deaths and infections among them. With the arrival of vaccines, CUPE is negotiating language in collective agreements to protect members' rights and ensure safe working conditions. Over 100 CUPE collective agreements include vaccine-related language, and the union has historically promoted vaccines as a control measure for disease spread while respecting individual medical decisions. The recommended language about COVID-19 vaccination covers no-cost access, paid time for vaccination, and the right to refuse with potential consequences outlined. Employers' responsibilities and processes for vaccine refusal are also addressed, with job protection emphasized. Members refusing the vaccine due to medical or religious reasons should be accommodated, while those refusing for personal reasons should have redeployment or leave options. The trigger for vaccine requirements should be determined by public health officials, not employers. Paid leave and benefits should be provided for those suffering illness from vaccination, and COVID-19 safety procedures should continue until public health officials declare the pandemic over. CUPE recognizes that members have the right to refuse vaccination, but employers may remove them from the workplace to protect others' health. Refusing members should still have job protection and access to lieu time, vacation, and sick leave. CUPE encourages members to follow public health directives and recommends getting vaccinated, consulting healthcare professionals for personalized advice. This article emphasizes the role of unions in protecting workers' rights and health during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the need for clear language in collective agreements regarding vaccination policies and their potential consequences. By negotiating these agreements, CUPE aims to balance individual rights with public health interests, ensuring a safe work environment for all members.

Title: Doug Ford says international travellers pose 'extreme risk' for COVID-19 spread. Here are the facts
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario Premier Doug Ford has criticized the federal government for not doing enough to protect the province from international travelers, who he believes are a significant source of COVID-19 spread. However, statistics show that travel-related COVID-19 cases represent a small number of infections in Ontario. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert, confirms that travel is not the main driver of the epidemic in the province at this time. Ford has specifically called for COVID-19 testing at Toronto's Pearson International Airport and claimed that a quarter of arriving travelers are not following quarantine rules. Federal officials, including Public Safety Minister Bill Blair and Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo, have defended Canada's border restrictions, which are among the strongest in the world. They include screening for symptoms, mandatory 14-day quarantine, and restrictions on non-essential travel. According to Ontario's COVID-19 case data for December 20, the majority of recorded infections were due to close contact with an infected person, unknown sources, or outbreaks in specific settings. Only two cases were attributed to travel. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu also noted that only 1.3% of Ontario's COVID-19 cases have originated from international travel. While travel-related cases are a small fraction, experts caution that they are not negligible. Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases physician, emphasizes that even one infected person on a flight can pose a risk. He and Professor Vivek Goel from the University of Toronto suggest that a combination of reduced quarantine and testing may be a better strategy to improve compliance and manage the risk of travel-related cases.

Title: The COVID-19 pandemic and life satisfaction in Canada
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the life satisfaction of Canadians, using data from the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and the June 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). Key findings include: In June 2020, the average life satisfaction of Canadians was 6.71 out of 10, a significant decline from the 2018 average of 8.09. This is the lowest level of life satisfaction observed in Canada in the past decade. The decline in life satisfaction was accompanied by an increase in inequality in its distribution, with a larger decrease in satisfaction among those who were previously highly satisfied. There was no significant difference in life satisfaction between men and women, either before or during the pandemic. The largest decline in life satisfaction was among young Canadians aged 15 to 29, while the smallest decline was among seniors over 60. The well-documented U-shaped relationship between age and life satisfaction was no longer evident in June 2020. Immigrant status was another factor impacting life satisfaction, with larger declines among immigrants from Asia and other regions compared to Canadian-born individuals. Labor market experiences and social factors may have contributed to these differences. Life satisfaction declined in all parts of Canada, with variations across provinces and regions. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, additional data and factors would be necessary, such as infection rates, hospitalization rates, and healthcare system capacity. However, life satisfaction data can provide insights into the overall well-being of Canadians and help identify areas or groups that may be disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Title: Celebrating Christmas during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: First Nations Health Authority
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Dr. Shannon McDonald, Acting Chief Medical Officer, advises people to stay at home, stick to their core bubble, and visit virtually during the Christmas season to reduce the spread of COVID-19. All events and gatherings are suspended until at least January 8th, and people are only allowed to interact with their "core bubble," which includes immediate household members. Those living alone can form a bubble with one or two others, and grandparents providing childcare can visit their grandchildren's bubble. COVID-19 spreads through gatherings, and holidays are a particularly vulnerable time, so it is important to resist the temptation to leave your bubble. To have a safe "COVID Christmas," people are encouraged to use technology for virtual parties and gift-opening, help others while maintaining physical distancing, shop online or use curbside pickup, practice moderation with treats and cocktails, find positive coping mechanisms like exercise and connecting with bubble members, focus on gratitude, and reach out for help if needed. These sacrifices are necessary to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities, with the goal of ensuring we can celebrate together again in the future. It is crucial to stay informed about and adhere to public health orders and recommendations.

Title: COVID-19 Impact Analysis and 2020 Outlook: The Retail Services Price Index
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Retail Services Price Index (RSPI) measures the change in the price of retail services or the margin price, which is the difference between the purchase price and selling price of a product. Despite a decrease in retail trade sales during the 2008-2009 recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, the RSPI remained positive during both periods. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, store closures led to a 13.6% drop in retail sales in Q2 2020, but the RSPI rose 1.2% as retailers moved online. During the pandemic's early stages, social distancing measures and store closures reduced household demand, but this was partially offset by increased online purchases and higher disposable income due to government support programs. The RSPI grew positively in Q2 2020 due to similar growth rates in retail purchase and selling price indexes, with gasoline stations, furniture, sporting goods, and electronics stores contributing the most. In contrast, the RSPI declined sharply during the 2008-2009 recession. The RSPI increased slightly more during the 2008-2009 recession (+2.0%) than during the COVID-19 pandemic (+1.4%) up to Q2 2020. The pandemic's impact on specific subsectors varied, with electronics and appliance stores (+4.6%) and sporting goods stores (+3.0%) experiencing significant increases in the RSPI, while motor vehicle and parts dealers, clothing stores, and general merchandise stores saw margin decreases. Gasoline stations were the only subsector with negative growth during the 2008-2009 recession. Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, retail stores have gradually reopened, leading to increased economic activity. However, the RSPI is not expected to increase significantly as selling prices are likely to remain low. The performance of subsectors in the latter half of 2020 is challenging to predict due to varying local economies and new measures related to the second wave of COVID-19. Nonetheless, general merchandise stores, clothing stores, health and personal care stores, and electronics and appliance stores are expected to post positive RSPI growth. In contrast, motor vehicle and parts dealers may continue to face challenges due to the reduced need for commuting. This article provides insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous recession affected the RSPI and its components. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and forecasts for the remaining quarters of 2020. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, while the article does not directly provide data or models for that purpose, the information presented can offer insights into the impact of the pandemic on the economy and retail sector, which could indirectly affect hospitalization rates. For example, the increase in online shopping and the shift to working from home may reduce hospitalizations by decreasing physical interactions and the spread of the virus.
