This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The article discusses a study that analyzed cannabis-related hospitalization rates in Canada before and after cannabis legalization. The study found a significant increase in hospitalizations due to cannabis-induced psychosis, particularly in provinces with rapid commercialization and increased access to cannabis products. Ontario, which is one of the provinces studied, showed a 20% increase in hospitalizations after complete legalization and commercialization compared to pre-legalization rates. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 20% increase in hospitalizations due to cannabis in Ontario after complete legalization and commercialization Significant increase in hospitalizations due to cannabis-induced psychosis Rapid commercialization and increased access to cannabis products associated with increased hospitalizations Note: The study's findings are relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to an increase in cannabis-related hospitalizations, particularly in provinces with rapid commercialization and increased access to cannabis products. However, the study's limitations, including the confounding bias of the COVID-19 pandemic, should be taken into account when interpreting the results.

The article highlights the following values important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 1. Availability of COVID-19 vaccines: Updated COVID-19 vaccines are rolling out in Ontario, targeting the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant. 2. Vaccine uptake: Physicians warn that staggered rollouts, patchwork approaches among provinces, and high costs for certain shots could hinder vaccine uptake among seniors. 3. Respiratory virus season: The article mentions that RSV and influenza vaccines will be available this fall, which could impact COVID-19 hospitalizations. 4. Vulnerable populations: Seniors, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, are more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19, RSV, and influenza. 5.
