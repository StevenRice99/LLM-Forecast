Title: What if your COVID tests are expired?
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: With COVID-19 cases rising, people in Montreal are concerned about the availability and expiry of rapid tests. Rapid tests are still available at government vaccination centres, and some individuals can still access them at pharmacies. Health Canada and the FDA have extended the expiry dates of rapid tests to two years from the manufacturing date. The article explains that expiration dates are not always accurate, especially for products with a shelf life over 90 days, and that many medications may still be effective past their expiry dates. In the case of COVID-19 rapid tests, the concern is mainly about inaccurate results, especially false negatives, due to potential degradation of the antibodies in the test kit. The article concludes by advising people to get new rapid tests at vaccination centres if they have any doubts about the validity of their current tests, especially before getting flu/COVID boosters this fall. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models. However, the concern about rising cases and the emphasis on testing suggest that hospitalizations could increase if people do not take preventive measures and get updated on their vaccinations. The availability of rapid tests and the extension of their expiry dates can help identify infections and prevent further spread, potentially reducing the strain on healthcare systems.

Title: Supporting women’s recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, livelihoods and health

The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on women's access to healthcare and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas. Social distancing and income loss due to job losses have made it difficult for women to access essential health services, leading to increased susceptibility to infections, unplanned pregnancies, and worsening health conditions. However, some rural women in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, have adapted by taking up subsistence farming to address food insecurity. The pandemic has also had cascading effects on women due to reverse migration, drug use, rising crime, gender-based violence, and reduced service delivery. To "rebuild better," a project aims to empower local women and stakeholders to find solutions, especially in public health and livelihood spheres. In Kenya, the Chamas for Change project studies the impact of a community health volunteer-led program that engages women during pregnancy and their children's first 1,000 days. The project aims to institutionalize inclusive approaches in COVID-19 responses and is supported by a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to ensure community engagement and perspective inclusion. The CAB in Kenya comprises various community representatives and has empowered its members as change agents. It has also facilitated collaboration with the education sector to reenroll teenage mothers in school or vocational training. The project's inclusive approach has increased understanding of the importance of gender dimensions in designing effective pandemic responses. These initiatives aim to build resilience and improve health outcomes for women and their communities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 confinement worsened older Canadians’ feelings of loneliness, according to new Concordia research
Publisher: Concordia University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article identifies three distinct loneliness trajectories that individuals may fall into during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can help forecast hospitalizations. The first group experienced stable and low levels of loneliness, despite confinement measures, while the second group reported fluctuating moderate loneliness that increased with stricter confinement. The third group had sustained-elevated levels of loneliness throughout. Those with moderate or elevated loneliness were more likely to be female, live alone, have health issues, and face psychological distress. They also had fewer face-to-face interactions and perceived COVID-19 as a greater threat. As social isolation continues, feelings of distress and loneliness are likely to increase, leading to a self-reinforcing pattern of social withdrawal. This could result in more hospitalizations as individuals may be less likely to seek help or connect with others, impacting both their mental and physical health.

The article discusses the distribution of flu and COVID-19 vaccines in Ottawa to specific groups at high risk of health complications. Ottawa Public Health received a vaccine shipment and started distributing them to healthcare workers, first responders, residents of congregate living settings, pregnant individuals, seniors, and others. The upcoming respiratory season is expected to be atypical, with flu, RSV, and COVID-19 circulating simultaneously. It is recommended that everyone 6 months and older get the flu vaccine and the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The Ministry of Health advises individuals to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine if it has been six months since their last dose or known infection. Appointments for vaccines can be booked through OPH Community Clinics, pharmacies, or healthcare providers. The latest data shows low flu levels, moderate RSV levels, and high COVID-19 levels in Ottawa, with new hospitalizations and deaths reported.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccines and People with Cancer

Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: Cancer patients and their caregivers are urged to get COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters by the CDC, NCCN, and other organizations. COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, including most people with underlying conditions like cancer, according to the CDC. Patients who have recently undergone a stem cell transplant or received CAR T-cell therapy should delay vaccination until at least 3 months after completing treatment due to potential limited efficacy. Cancer treatment will not be affected by the COVID-19 vaccine, and cancer survivors with weakened immune systems should get vaccinated. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, recurrence, or progression, and they do not alter DNA. Lymph node swelling may occur after vaccination, particularly in the armpit of the vaccinated arm, indicating a positive immune response. Researchers are studying vaccine efficacy in people with various types of cancer, and data suggest additional vaccine doses may improve immune responses in some cancer patients. COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in people with blood cancers or those on aggressive chemotherapy, but any amount of protection is beneficial. Family members and caregivers of cancer patients should also get vaccinated and take precautions to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. Yearly boosters may be needed due to waning immunity and emerging variants, and research is ongoing to determine the frequency and timing of additional boosters.

The article outlines the billing codes and fees for physicians in British Columbia, Canada, related to respiratory illness assessments and immunizations for the 2023-2024 season, with a focus on COVID-19. Here's a summary: Assessment for COVID-19 Therapeutics (Fee Code 10046): This fee is billable by any family physician or specialist for assessing a patient's eligibility for COVID-19 treatments, prescribing therapeutics, and arranging for treatment. It is billed per 15-minute interval, up to a maximum of 60 minutes per patient per day. Respiratory Immunization Fee Codes: For patients 19 years or older (with an office visit): Fee code 10040 with a value of $5.82 is payable for influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis, and COVID-19 immunizations. For patients 19 years or older (without an office visit): Fee code B10041 with a value of $14.00 is payable when the primary purpose of the visit is respiratory immunization. Pediatric COVID-19 Immunization (for patients 18 years or younger): Fee code 10047 with a value of $5.82 is payable for COVID-19 immunization for patients under 18 years of age and is billed with an office visit. Temporary Code for LFP Payment Model: Physicians can bill for respiratory immunizations (influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis, and COVID-19) provided by allied care providers using the temporary code 98101. This code is applicable when the allied care provider is paid out of practice earnings and works directly within the practice team. These billing codes and fees are important for physicians to accurately bill for their services related to respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Accurate billing data can also help public health officials forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by understanding the demand for assessments and immunizations.

Title: Quebecers can now get a new COVID-19 shot. What you need to know about the virus and vaccines
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are rising in Quebec, with 4,091 new infections and 57 deaths in the week of September 24-30. As of October 3, 1,493 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, including 36 in intensive care. Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious diseases specialist, estimates that the case numbers are actually much higher, with 20,000 to 30,000 new cases per day in Quebec. In response, the province is offering updated COVID-19 vaccines and flu shots to all residents starting Tuesday. People in long-term care homes and private seniors' residences have been eligible for the updated COVID-19 vaccine since October 2, while everyone else can get it starting October 10. Appointments can be booked through the Clic Santé website or by calling 1-877-644-4545. Both the COVID-19 and flu shots can be administered during the same appointment, although children under 11 will have to wait for the online booking system to catch up. The updated COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for those who are at high risk of suffering complications from the virus, including those living in long-term care homes, people over 60, those with compromised immune systems, pregnant women, and healthcare workers. The vaccines target the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant and are considered more tailored to the currently circulating strains. There may be delays in receiving the updated COVID-19 vaccine as some pharmacies and service centres taking appointments don't have the new shots yet. However, the Quebec Health Ministry assures that they are doing everything possible to ensure that institutions and pharmacies receive the necessary doses as soon as possible.
