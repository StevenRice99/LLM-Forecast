Title: ICU doctor sounds note of optimism amid worrying surge in COVID-19 cases
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: 313 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Ontario on Monday, with 61 in Ottawa, the largest one-day increase since May. Despite the increase in cases, hospitalizations remain low, with only 9 patients being treated for COVID-19 in hospital on Tuesday, none in intensive care. The demographics of hospitalizations have not changed significantly since the pandemic began, with older patients with comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity) being the typical patients. Younger people are unlikely to translate into increased hospitalizations or mortality, but still pose a risk if they pass the virus to more vulnerable individuals. Public health measures such as hand washing, physical distancing, and mask-wearing have kept the pressure off local hospitals. Medical professionals have noticed a significant change in attitude, with a sense that they can handle what's in front of them and have created the infrastructure and capacity to increase ICU beds if needed. These values suggest that while cases are increasing, hospitalizations remain low, and the demographics of hospitalizations have not changed significantly. However, continued public health measures are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus to more vulnerable individuals.

Title: Ontario being warned that COVID-19 progress is 'slipping away'
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of COVID-19 patients in University Health Network (UHN) hospitals has increased from 0 to 7, with most in intensive care. Ontario-wide hospitalizations have increased from 35 in August to at least 77, with a discrepancy between Ministry of Health reports (47) and actual numbers. The increase in hospitalizations is reminiscent of the early days of the first wave, according to Dr. Kevin Smith, UHN President and CEO. The healthcare sector is better prepared for a potential second wave, but there are concerns about hospitals being overwhelmed if cases spike again. The Ontario Hospital Association warns that progress in limiting the spread of the virus is "slipping away" and transmission is "accelerating". Key metrics: + Current hospitalizations: at least 77 (higher than Ministry of Health reports) + Increase in hospitalizations: from 35 in August + ICU cases: majority of the 7 cases in UHN hospitals + New cases: 313 (highest daily count since June 5) + Active cases: above 2,000 These values suggest an increasing trend in hospitalizations, which is a critical metric for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
