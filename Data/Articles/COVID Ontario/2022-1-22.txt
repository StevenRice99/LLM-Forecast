Title: Some patients go in for COVID-19, others are infected alongside another issue. In hospitals, those lines blur
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the challenges of distinguishing between patients admitted directly for COVID-19 and those admitted for other health issues who also test positive. It notes that the Omicron variant is infecting a wide assortment of patients, and that even incidental COVID-19 infections can have a significant impact on patient outcomes and hospital capacity. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: The high number of infected patients admitted to hospitals is putting strain on the healthcare system, regardless of how patients are classified. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 while in hospital for another issue often have poorer outcomes than those who are not battling a coronavirus infection. The Omicron surge is expected to continue to put pressure on hospitals in the coming weeks, with "several weeks of very intense activity expected to come." The breakdown of hospital data into patients admitted for COVID-19 and those with incidental infections may not capture the full nuance of patient experiences and care in a system under strain during a pandemic. These points suggest that forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario should take into account not only the number of patients admitted directly for COVID-19, but also the impact of incidental infections on patient outcomes and hospital capacity.
