Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Relevant values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Admissions due to COVID-19 vs. incidental infections: distinguishing between patients admitted directly for COVID-19 and those admitted for other health issues who also test positive
Severity of illness: Omicron variant often causing less severe illness than Delta, but still resulting in higher hospitalization rates
Vaccination status: millions of Canadians are now protected from dire health impacts due to vaccinations
Increased length of stay and mortality for incidental COVID-19 cases: patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, heart inflammation, and other complications have poorer outcomes when infected with COVID-19
Ripple effect on the healthcare system: cancelled and delayed surgeries, increased risk of complications during surgery, and strain on hospital resources due to repeated exposures and virus transmission within hospitals.
