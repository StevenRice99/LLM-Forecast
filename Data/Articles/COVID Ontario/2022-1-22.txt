Title: How mRNA Vaccines Might Help Treat Cancer
Publisher: National Cancer Institute (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the potential of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in treating cancer, highlighting the success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Here are the key points and important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: mRNA vaccines provide powerful protection against severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers have hoped to use mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment, with small trials showing promising early results. Dozens of clinical trials are testing mRNA cancer vaccines for various cancer types, including pancreatic, colorectal, and melanoma. No mRNA cancer vaccine has been approved by the US FDA yet, but the success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may accelerate research. mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells to produce proteins that stimulate an immune response against viruses or tumor cells. Dendritic cells present the proteins to immune cells like T cells, educating them to recognize and kill cancer or virus-infected cells. The speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic demonstrated the flexibility and scalability of mRNA vaccine technology. Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines are designed based on individual tumor characteristics, aiming to elicit an immune response against abnormal proteins (neoantigens) produced by cancer cells. Early results from a clinical trial combining a personalized mRNA vaccine with an immune checkpoint inhibitor showed positive outcomes for patients with head and neck cancer. Further research is needed to optimize the identification of neoantigens for personalized mRNA cancer vaccines and their combination with other treatments. Insights gained from the widespread use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may inform and accelerate the development of mRNA cancer vaccines.

Title: What It’s Like to Have a Mild COVID-19 Case
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: With the rollout of vaccines and the emergence of the Omicron variant, most vaccinated and boosted individuals who contract COVID-19 will likely experience mild symptoms. Symptoms associated with the Omicron variant tend to be milder and primarily affect the upper respiratory system, such as a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and sore throat. Mild COVID-19 refers to symptomatic cases that do not require hospitalization. However, "mild" can encompass a range of symptoms, from headaches and congestion to loss of taste and smell, and some people may even be bedridden with fever for an extended period. The severity of infection depends on various factors, including vaccination status, the variant contracted, viral load, overall health, and immune response. The article includes personal accounts of mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the varying symptoms and duration of the illness. It also emphasizes that even with milder variants like Omicron, COVID-19 can still overwhelm hospitals due to the sheer number of cases. According to experts, immunity is the most critical factor in determining the severity of infection. Vaccination and prior illness contribute to immunity, while factors like age, underlying health conditions, and nutritional status can influence immune function and impact the severity of COVID-19. The article also addresses the connection between mild COVID-19 and long COVID, a condition where symptoms persist or develop after the initial infection has cleared. Vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing long COVID, and fully vaccinated individuals are no more likely to experience long-haul symptoms than those who have never been infected. While mild COVID-19 may not require hospitalization, the article cautions that it can still have serious long-term impacts, and more research is needed to understand the full scope of the virus's long-term effects.

In their Viewpoint article published in Science, Avindra Nath, M.D., and Serena Spudich, M.D., emphasize the importance of understanding the neurological impacts of COVID-19 and the need for comprehensive research on Long Covid. They outline the current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2's effects on the brain and nervous system, including acute symptoms like loss of taste and smell, headaches, stroke, delirium, and brain inflammation. These symptoms can sometimes persist and develop into Long Covid, along with other issues like impaired concentration, fatigue, pain, sleep disorders, and psychological effects. Given the variability of symptoms and the fact that many Long Covid patients were previously healthy, the authors stress the urgency of extensive research to identify the full scope of Long Covid complications and their causes. This research is vital for developing diagnostic and treatment tools to address the growing public health concern of Long Covid. The NIH RECOVER COVID initiative is one such ambitious program aimed at achieving these research goals.

Title: What doctors wish patients knew about breakthrough COVID infections
Publisher: American Medical Association
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: What to Know About COVID-19 Vaccination, Boosters and Breakthrough Infections COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson are effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, but breakthrough infections can still occur, especially with the highly transmissible Omicron variant. A breakthrough infection is defined as a detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in a fully vaccinated person, occurring at least 14 days after receiving the final recommended dose of one of the three vaccines. Booster breakthroughs can also occur, where a boosted individual tests positive for COVID-19 at least 14 days after receiving the booster shot. While breakthrough infections were uncommon with the Delta variant, they are more frequent with Omicron due to waning immunity over time and the emergence of new variants. Most breakthrough infections are mild or asymptomatic, with 90% of cases resulting in mild illness. However, 10% of cases may still require hospitalization, and 1-2% of hospitalized patients may unfortunately die. Unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of severe disease and transmission, with 80% of Omicron hospitalizations occurring in unvaccinated people. Breakthrough infections are not unique to COVID-19 vaccines and have been observed with other vaccines as well. No vaccine is 100% effective, and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines varies depending on the patient's characteristics and the virus variant. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible, and infected individuals, regardless of vaccination status, can spread the virus to others. Therefore, it is crucial to get tested, quarantine, isolate, and wear masks to protect vulnerable individuals. Individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19, such as those with transplants or immunosuppression, should be vigilant about monitoring symptoms and seek testing if exposed to COVID-19. Getting vaccinated and boosted remains crucial to preventing severe disease and reducing the impact of future variants.

Title: Understanding COVID-19 PCR Testing
Publisher: National Human Genome Research Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article explains the meaning of positive and negative results on a COVID-19 PCR test, which can be useful for forecasting hospitalizations. A positive result indicates the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample, suggesting the individual is infected. On the other hand, a negative result means that the virus was not detected in the sample. It is important to note that false negatives can occur if the amount of virus in the sample is too low, which is more likely early in the infection or if the test is not conducted properly. False positives, though unlikely, are also possible but less frequent. Understanding these test results is crucial for individuals to make informed decisions about isolation and treatment and for public health officials to forecast the impact on hospitalizations and plan accordingly.

Title: Airlines seek end to mandatory COVID-19 testing of vaccinated passengers on arrival
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Canada's major airlines and busiest airport have requested that the federal government eliminate the requirement for vaccinated travelers to undergo COVID-19 testing upon arrival. They argue that testing resources could be better utilized in the community, especially in critical areas like schools, hospitals, and long-term care facilities. This request comes as COVID-19 cases surge and provinces prioritize molecular testing for individuals at higher risk of hospitalization or in high-spread settings. The airlines and airport highlight that the positivity rate among fully vaccinated air travelers is significantly lower than the national average, and advocate for a return to random arrival testing and isolation only for symptomatic or positive overseas arrivals. Experts support this approach, questioning the added value of mandatory airport testing in preventing Omicron spread. They suggest that tracking every case is unnecessary, especially when Omicron is already widespread globally. Dr. Lynora Saxinger emphasizes the value of testing travelers for monitoring new variants, but acknowledges its limited immediate impact on Omicron. The Canadian Travel and Tourism Roundtable urges the government to redeploy testing capacity and reduce the burden on travelers, as processing times exceed the standard delivery period.

Title: With COVID-19, Air Is Both the Problem and the Solution
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Introduction: In March 2020, the WHO tweeted that COVID-19 was not airborne, which puzzled and angered aerosol scientists. Over time, the WHO and other organizations changed their stance and acknowledged that the virus could spread via respiratory droplets and also stay airborne. The History of Disease Understanding: For most of human history, diseases were attributed to "foul air" or "bad air." From the 4th century BCE to 1880, the West believed in the miasma theory of disease transmission through bad air. However, evidence began to accumulate that invisible germs were the true cause of diseases. Charles Chapin, a physician, rejected the idea of bad air and believed that droplets full of microbes were responsible for contagious diseases. The Emergence of Airborne Pathogens: In the 20th century, it was discovered that diseases like tuberculosis, measles, and chickenpox could spread through airborne transmission. Despite this, major public health agencies were reluctant to accept that COVID-19 was airborne, considering it an extraordinary claim. Assessing and Improving Ventilation: To assess ventilation in a room, an NDIR CO2 sensor can be used; levels above 1,000 ppm indicate insufficient ventilation. Improving ventilation can be as simple as opening windows, especially in older buildings without HVAC systems. For newer buildings, adjusting HVAC parameters and schedules can enhance air circulation. Air Filtration Solutions: Air filtration devices, often called "air purifiers," use fans and filters to remove particles from the air, including the coronavirus. HEPA filters are effective but can be expensive and require proper sizing for the room. Homemade air cleaners, such as Corsi-Rosenthal boxes, are a cost-effective alternative and have been shown to work surprisingly well. Filters are rated based on their ability to capture 0.3-micron particles, which are the most difficult to capture. Avoid air cleaners that use ions, plasma, or release substances like ozone or hypochlorous acid, as they may be ineffective or harmful. Placement and Maintenance of Air Cleaners: Air cleaners should be placed away from walls and corners for optimal airflow. It is recommended to change the filter every six months, or as usage dictates, while wearing a mask and gloves and disposing of the filter outside. Expert Recommendations: Priority solutions include moving activities outdoors, wearing N95 masks or their equivalent, and improving room ventilation and air filtration. Resistance to the idea of airborne disease may be due to fear of causing panic among the public. Simple solutions like improving ventilation, using air filtration devices, and wearing better masks can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, can spread through tiny aerosols that remain airborne. Good ventilation and air filtration are crucial to reducing indoor transmission. CO2 sensors and air filtration devices, including homemade options, are effective tools to mitigate the spread.
