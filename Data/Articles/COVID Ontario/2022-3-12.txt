Title: 2 years into the pandemic, Canada's mental-health system is at a crisis point
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the deteriorating mental health of Canadians over the past two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began. A survey revealed that 54% of Canadians reported worsened mental health, with women being significantly more affected than men. Concerns about future pandemic developments, such as new variants, were prevalent among respondents. The prolonged stress, grief, and trauma from the pandemic are expected to have long-term mental health implications. The mental health crisis is not unique to Canada, as global research by the World Health Organization showed a 25% increase in anxiety and depression worldwide during the first year of the pandemic. The existing mental health-care system in Canada, described as fragmented and underfunded, is struggling to meet the increased demand for services. Experts emphasize the need for a comprehensive restructuring of the mental health-care system rather than just increased funding. Efforts to break down barriers to access and provide early interventions are crucial. The federal government has allocated $4.5 billion for mental health over five years, aiming to improve treatment availability. However, more focus on universal mental health care and addressing systemic issues is needed. Despite the challenges, experts believe in the resilience of individuals and the collective ability to bounce back from the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Building healthy relationships, seeking support, and reducing stressors are highlighted as ways to maintain mental well-being during these challenging times.

Title: What doctors wish patients knew about long COVID
Publisher: American Medical Association
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 hospitalizations and long-term effects: Most people with COVID-19 will not become severely ill and often recover within weeks. Staying up-to-date with vaccinations, including boosters, dramatically lowers the chances of hospitalization. However, even a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to long COVID, a range of new or ongoing health problems lasting more than four weeks after the initial infection. Long COVID can be categorized into three types: direct cell damage caused by the virus, symptoms related to prolonged hospitalization (such as muscle weakness, cognitive dysfunction, and psychosocial stress), and symptoms appearing after recovery due to the interplay between the immune system and inflammatory markers. Long COVID affects all organ systems and can include fatigue, post-exertional malaise, anxiety, depression, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, loss of taste and smell, cardiac issues (tachycardia and bradycardia), respiratory problems (shortness of breath), gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, diarrhea), kidney damage, blood clots, skin conditions (hair loss, rashes), and endocrine issues (sick euthyroid syndrome). Initial data suggested that children were less likely to experience long COVID, but recent evidence indicates that they can also develop similar symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia, which tend to disappear within a few months. Studies show that middle-aged women are more likely to experience long COVID than men, emphasizing the need for further research to understand this disparity. Patients with long COVID symptoms should seek clinical care, as the condition often presents as a cluster of symptoms. Multidisciplinary clinics and a holistic approach are recommended to address the multitiered and multifaceted nature of the condition. COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against long COVID, even in rare cases of breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals are 50% less likely to develop long COVID. In addition to vaccination, following preventive measures like wearing masks, handwashing, and physical distancing can help end the pandemic and reduce the incidence of long COVID. Overall, while most COVID-19 cases may not require hospitalization, the potential for long COVID underscores the importance of vaccination and preventive measures to minimize the risk of infection and its long-term consequences.

Title: COVID at Two: Vast majorities say the pandemic has pulled Canadians apart, brought out the worst in people -
Publisher: Angus Reid Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
It has been over two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and a new study reveals how Canadians have been affected and their outlook for the future. While most Canadians are grateful to live in Canada during this time, there is also a sense of darkness and pessimism about the impact of the pandemic and the country's ability to handle future health crises. Here are the key findings: 82% believe the pandemic has divided people, and 79% say it has brought out the worst in people. 70% believe Canada will struggle in the next pandemic, and only 30% think the country is well-prepared. 54% know a close friend or family member who was infected, and 36% had an infection in their household. 11% describe the disruption to their lives as severe, and 47% as significant. Younger people are more likely to report higher levels of disruption. 72% postponed travel, 48% delayed medical appointments, and 26% postponed serious procedures or surgery. 11% moved to a different community, and B.C. residents were the most likely to relocate. Younger Canadians are more likely to have been personally infected and less likely to follow protocols, partly due to working in public-facing jobs. Two-thirds of Canadians aged 18-34 felt their lives were significantly or severely impacted, while half of those over 54 felt minor alterations. Western Canadians are more likely to view the last two years positively, and higher-income households also report more positives than negatives. Half of Canadians feel the last two years were more bad than good, and this sentiment is stronger among lower-income individuals. 38% had difficulty caring for loved ones during the pandemic, particularly women under 55. These findings highlight the challenges Canadians have faced during the pandemic and their concerns about the country's ability to handle future health crises.

Title: COVID-19 immune response improves for months after vaccination
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses research that suggests the COVID-19 immune response improves for months after vaccination. This has important implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it suggests that vaccinated individuals may continue to develop stronger protection against the virus over time, reducing the likelihood of severe disease requiring hospitalization. Key facts from the article include: B cells, which produce antibodies to fight off SARS-CoV-2, evolve and improve their ability to protect against the virus for months after vaccination. The study found that both antibodies and memory B cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were present in all participants six months after receiving two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The B cells in the lymph nodes persisted and changed significantly over the six-month period, resulting in antibodies that were better at binding to and neutralizing the virus. The improved B cells in the bone marrow samples suggested that they were derived from the lymph node B cells. The refinement of the antibody response over time results in higher quality antibodies that are better at protecting against the virus, even if the quantity of antibodies decreases. This study provides valuable insight into how the immune system responds to COVID-19 vaccination and has implications for the development of more effective and longer-lasting vaccination strategies, including the optimization of booster shots. Understanding the duration and evolution of immunity after vaccination can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by providing a more accurate assessment of the level of protection offered by vaccines over time.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic Disproportionately Affected Women in the Americas
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The PAHO report reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected women in the Americas, exacerbating gender inequality in health and negatively impacting women's development and well-being. Women, who make up the majority of healthcare workers, were at increased risk of COVID-19 infection due to their caregiver roles, accounting for 72% of cases among healthcare professionals in the region. The pandemic also took a toll on their mental health, with female healthcare workers more susceptible to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and burnout. Lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus's spread trapped many women in unsafe home environments, as evidenced by the surge in domestic violence hotline calls in some countries. Additionally, the refocusing of healthcare services on COVID-19 emergencies left many women and girls without adequate support for their health needs, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, where one in four adolescents lacked access to family planning services. The report also highlights the pandemic's impact on maternal health, with over 365,000 COVID-19 cases reported in pregnant women in the region and more than 3,000 deaths. The fear of COVID-19 and the uncertainty of safe delivery in health facilities added to the challenges faced by expectant mothers. A critical shortfall in the pandemic response has been the lack of a gender-based approach, as gender is often absent from analyses of the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19. This omission hinders the understanding of the differing consequences of the disease on men and women. To address these inequalities and build a better future for women and girls in the region, PAHO emphasizes the crucial need for disaggregated data to identify health inequities and inform effective responses.
