Title: Who Killed Granny? Pandemic Death Protocols in Canada’s Long-term Care Facilities
Publisher: C2C Journal
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the challenges faced by long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Ontario and Quebec during the early stages of the pandemic, including lack of trained staff, misuse of narcotics, shortage of supplies, and inadequate nutrition and hydration of residents. The military reports and journalist investigations revealed grim conditions in these facilities, which may have contributed to the high death rate among elderly patients. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 1. LTCFs were under lockdown, and residents were not being properly cared for, leading to potential malnourishment and dehydration. 2. The lack of reliable data on cause of death in LTCFs hinders attempts to understand the true impact of the pandemic on this population. 3. The concept of population triage, or disaster triage, was employed to prioritize hospital capacity over individual patient outcomes, potentially leading to decisions that put vulnerable LTCF residents at risk. 4. Directives were issued in Quebec and other jurisdictions to discourage transferring sick patients from LTCFs to hospitals, which may have contributed to the high death rate in these facilities. These points highlight the need to consider the impact of LTCF conditions and population triage decisions on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly among the elderly population.
