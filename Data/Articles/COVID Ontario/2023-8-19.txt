TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Early signals of a fall COVID-19 wave in Canada, with fluctuations in virus activity and an increase in positive test results (9% as of the latest data). Hospitalizations increased in August, with an 11% jump in one week, and over 1,700 hospital beds occupied by COVID patients as of August 15. Wastewater signals are rising, with at least 13 of 39 sites tracked by federal officials reporting an increase. Ontario's wastewater is showing an increase in virus samples, according to Western University microbiologist Eric Arts. Experts say the level of population immunity and the timing of fall booster shots will largely determine the size of Canada's fall surge. Waning immunity and the emergence of a new subvariant (EG.5) could contribute to a larger wave. Booster shots are not yet approved in Canada or the US, and distribution is expected to be delayed until mid-to-late October or later. Experts recommend getting an updated dose once fresh vaccines arrive, particularly for high-risk individuals, and suggest waiting roughly six months after a previous vaccine dose or known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Basic precautions such as avoiding crowded indoor locations, wearing a mask, and staying away from others when sick can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Title: COVID-19 activity in Canada showing early signs that it may be increasing: data

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: COVID-19 infections may be slowly rising again in Canada, with signs of continued fluctuations in some activity indicators after a long period of decline. Wastewater surveillance and COVID-19 test positivity rates are being used to determine the level of COVID-19 activity. Factors contributing to the potential rise in cases include waning immunity, new subvariants (XBB and EG.5), and people moving indoors in the fall. The EG.5 subvariant is expected to dominate in the coming weeks and appears to have more immunity-evading properties, making it more contagious. Seniors and immunocompromised individuals will be most affected by an increase in COVID-19 cases. Updated vaccines targeting the XBB subvariant family are expected to be effective in preventing severe infection and reducing the risk of symptomatic disease. Public health agencies advise staying home when feeling sick and getting vaccinated when available to protect against spreading COVID-19. These points suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may increase in the coming weeks, particularly among seniors and immunocompromised individuals, due to the spread of new subvariants and waning immunity.

Title: More people than expected are dying in Canada in 2023 for reasons that are not yet clear

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 case counts are down dramatically from a year ago, but hospitalizations are higher than during the first two pandemic summers and are hovering around their lowest point since December 2021. There are now fewer than 30 COVID-19 deaths reported across the country per week, but the real toll COVID-19 continues to take on Canadians is not yet known due to limited testing and undetected or unreported deaths. Excess mortality, which is a calculation of how many more deaths occur than are predicted based on demographic factors, is about 15-20% higher than it was in 2020 and 2021, with an estimated 90,500 excess deaths in Canada since the start of the pandemic. The total number of COVID-19 deaths recorded since the start of the pandemic stands at 53,216, according to Public Health Agency of Canada data. In Canada, provinces lag in their reporting to the official Canadian Vital Statistics Database, which collects information, including cause of death, for all deaths in the country, making it difficult to determine the true number of COVID-19 deaths. Experts believe that excess mortality is an indication that something is happening that is worth investigating, but it doesn't indicate what is actually happening or what to do about it. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the current state of the pandemic, including case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as the challenges in accurately tracking and reporting COVID-19-related data.
