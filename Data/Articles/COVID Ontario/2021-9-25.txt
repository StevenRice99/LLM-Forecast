Title: A Canadian COVID-19 study that turned out to be wrong has spread like wildfire among anti-vaxxers
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
An inaccurate Canadian study claiming an inflated rate of heart inflammation as a side effect of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines has been retracted due to a mathematical error. The study, which has not undergone peer review, identified 32 patients with rare side effects out of 32,379 mRNA vaccine doses administered in Ottawa from June to July, suggesting a rate of almost 1 in 1,000. However, the actual number of doses administered during that period was over 800,000, resulting in a corrected side effect rate of approximately 1 in 25,000. The error was acknowledged by the authors, who retracted the study, emphasizing that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. While mild cases of heart inflammation have been observed in a small number of vaccinated individuals, experts emphasize that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the low risk of this treatable side effect. The incident highlights the challenges posed by preprints, which can be quickly disseminated and exploited by anti-vaccination activists, underscoring the importance of scientific rigor and responsible communication.

Tingting Yan, a University of Toronto master's student, and Rahul Arora, a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, co-created SeroTracker, an online tool that tracks serology test data to estimate global COVID-19 infections more accurately. Serology tests identify COVID-19 antibodies in an individual's blood, indicating prior infection or vaccination. SeroTracker addresses the limitation of confirmed cases, which only represent a fraction of total infections. The dashboard visualizes and compares antibody prevalence across countries, demographic groups, and occupations, utilizing data from governments and research organizations. With a diverse team, SeroTracker has analyzed nearly 3,000 serosurveys from 116 countries, aiding organizations like the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization in modeling disease spread and guiding pandemic responses. The tool has also shed light on disproportionately affected communities and informed investment decisions in serosurveys in lowand middle-income countries. Yan and her team plan to expand the platform's utility beyond COVID-19, utilizing machine learning to predict abstract inclusion for efficient data analysis in various disease scenarios. SeroTracker is funded by multiple organizations, including the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization.

Title: Alberta asks Ottawa for help to airlift COVID-19 patients out of the province
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

Alberta's government has requested federal assistance to alleviate the strain on its healthcare system due to an influx of COVID-19 patients. The province's ICU capacity is at 87%, and without additional surge beds, it would exceed its baseline capacity. There are currently 222 COVID-19 patients in ICUs, nearly 1000 hospitalized, and over 20,900 active cases. Surgeries have been canceled, and Health Minister Tyler Shandro has been replaced. The request for aid comes after Premier Jason Kenney reintroduced restrictions and a vaccine passport, admitting the system was at risk of collapse. The timing of the request, however, has been questioned, as federal help was offered before the election. Health workers and opposition critics argue that the delay was a political strategy and that the situation could have been avoided with earlier government action. Alberta's current spike has been attributed to the early lifting of restrictions, and the government's inaction during the summer. With triage protocols looming, healthcare workers express frustration and heartbreak over the government's incompetence and the avoidable loss of life.

Title: Covid-19: How Much Herd Immunity is Enough?
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the question of what percentage of a population needs to be immune to COVID-19, either through infection or vaccination, for herd immunity to be achieved and the pandemic to end. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that herd immunity is achieved when 60-70% of a population is immune, a range still widely cited. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading infectious disease expert and advisor to the US government, has recently suggested that the herd immunity threshold may be higher than initially thought. This highlights the complexity of predicting COVID-19 hospitalizations and the end of the pandemic, as the situation is constantly evolving with new scientific and medical developments.

Title: Undergraduate research results in COVID-19 provincial report
Publisher: University of Winnipeg News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Sidney Leggett, a Métis computer science student at the University of Winnipeg, made a significant contribution to COVID-19 research by automating the COVID-19 Unintended Outcomes Report for the Government of Manitoba. This report focuses on the unintentional outcomes of the pandemic and the public health measures put in place to contain the virus. By automating the data cleaning, analysis, formatting, and report writing processes, Leggett improved the efficiency and accuracy of the report, making it easier to reproduce regular, useful reports that can inform public health decision-making and ameliorate public health measures. Leggett's work is crucial for understanding the broader impacts of COVID-19 and could help forecast hospitalizations by identifying trends and patterns in the data. Her work with the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit of the provincial government, where they monitor and analyze communicable and non-communicable diseases, further underscores the importance of her contributions to public health decision-making during the pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 patients in B.C.'s north being flown elsewhere for care as local hospitals hit limits
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

The article highlights the strain that COVID-19 is placing on healthcare resources in British Columbia, particularly in the Northern Health region. Due to a high rate of positive cases and a shortage of healthcare staff, critically ill patients are being transferred to other regions, including Vancouver Island. The Health Minister, Adrian Dix, stated that the Northern Health region is "overstretched" and that the pressure on critical care will continue until vaccination rates increase and hospitalizations decrease. Northern Health is facing a severe staffing shortage, with only 5 out of 20 permanent registered nursing positions filled in Fort St. John. The province is working to hire new nurses and has allocated funding to address the issue, but retention of nurses in the region remains a challenge. The article also mentions that a new notification system will be implemented by the end of the week to inform families when their children have been exposed to COVID-19 in a school setting. Dr. Bonnie Henry, the Provincial Health Officer, emphasized the importance of vaccination for pregnant people and those looking to get pregnant, as well as individuals who have previously had COVID-19. She noted that antibody levels after infection can vary and may not provide long-term immunity. Over the weekend, British Columbia confirmed 1,692 new cases of COVID-19 and 11 deaths. There were 307 people hospitalized, with 156 in intensive care, and the majority of those in the ICU were unvaccinated. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vaccination rate, the number of new cases, and the availability of healthcare resources. In the case of Northern Health, the region has the highest number of COVID-19 cases per capita in the province and is struggling to retain healthcare staff. This combination of factors is likely to result in an increase in hospitalizations and further strain on ICU capacity. The low vaccination rate in Northern Health, as mentioned by Dix, is also a cause for concern and could contribute to higher hospitalization rates.

Title: Covid-19 overtakes 1918 Spanish flu as deadliest disease in American history
Publisher: STAT
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
As of the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has become the deadliest disease event in American history, surpassing the death toll of the previously deadliest event, the 1918 Spanish Flu. The high number of deaths in the US is attributed to the country's inadequate early response to the pandemic. However, it is challenging to make direct comparisons between the two events due to differences in population size and life expectancy between 1918 and today. While modern medicine and vaccines have helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the death toll continues to climb, and the true number of deaths from COVID-19 is likely higher than the reported figures. According to research by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak, the actual COVID-19 death toll in the US is estimated to be approximately 10% higher than the declared number, placing the estimated death toll at around 741,000. This pandemic has provided a new lesson for medical historians, highlighting the need to adapt our response to disease outbreaks to the present and future contexts rather than relying solely on past precedents.

Title: Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19: Spotlight on Income, Employment, Access
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The Leger poll conducted by the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction reveals that COVID-19 has negatively affected the mental health and substance use levels of Canadians, particularly those with low incomes or who are unemployed. People in these vulnerable groups have reported increased substance use and higher rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The survey also found that one in four individuals in these groups cited finances as a significant pandemic stressor and that they faced more barriers in accessing treatment services for their mental health and substance use. These barriers include financial constraints, a lack of accessible or available help, and long wait lists. These findings suggest that the pandemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable Canadians, and highlights the need for accessible and affordable mental health and substance use treatment services. It also indicates that financial stress is a significant factor in the mental health of individuals during the pandemic. This information can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying at-risk groups and the potential long-term impacts on their physical and mental health.

Title: Why did Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines get new names after approval? Experts explain - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the recent full approval of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines by Health Canada, along with the renaming of the vaccines to "Comirnaty" and "Spikevax" respectively. The article emphasizes that these are just name changes and there are no alterations to the vaccines themselves. The renaming was a branding exercise decided by the vaccine makers and not Health Canada. The full approval allows children aged 12 and up to receive the vaccines. Experts mentioned in the article suggest that the renaming is part of the normal regulatory process and that the old names of the vaccines are likely to stick in the long run. The article also highlights that the new brand names may not significantly impact the public's perception of the vaccines or influence people's decision to get vaccinated. Some experts and doctors still prefer to use the old names like Pfizer and Moderna due to the complexity of the new names. Overall, the article indicates that the renaming of the vaccines is not expected to have a major impact on vaccine uptake or discussions surrounding the vaccines.
