The article also includes interviews with current and former inmates, as well as a prison guard, who describe the lack of protective equipment, physical distancing, and access to water and soap in jails. They also highlight the use of isolation as a preventive measure, which has been criticized by the Correctional Investigator of Canada as a form of torture. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for more comprehensive data and testing in correctional institutions to prevent future outbreaks and protect the health and rights of inmates and staff. It also raises concerns about the inhumane conditions and lack of precautions in these facilities, which may have contributed to the spread of the virus.

Title: COVID-19 and gender equality: Countering the regressive effects
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a regressive effect on gender equality, with women's jobs being 1.8 times more vulnerable than men's. Women account for 54% of overall job losses globally, despite making up only 39% of the workforce. The pandemic is increasing the burden of unpaid care, which falls disproportionately on women, and is one of the reasons for the higher impact on women's employment. According to the article, the global GDP growth could be $1 trillion lower by 2030 if no action is taken to address the gender gap caused by the pandemic. However, taking action now to advance gender equality could add $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030. The article also highlights the uneven progress towards gender equality before the pandemic, with the global Gender Parity Score (GPS) only increasing slightly from 0.60 in 2014 to 0.61 today. The article analyzes the impact of the pandemic on women's employment in six countries: France, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, and the United States. It finds that the gendered nature of work across industries explains one-fourth of the difference in job loss rates between men and women. The remaining three-fourths are attributed to societal barriers and the increased burden of unpaid care work during the pandemic. The article also discusses the potential impact of COVID-19 on female entrepreneurship and the role of traditional societal mindsets about women's roles. It highlights the need for action to address the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women, arguing that it will improve social and economic outcomes for women and boost economic growth. Finally, the article presents three scenarios for GDP in 2030, emphasizing the value of greater gender equality. The "do nothing" scenario assumes no action is taken, leading to a regressive impact on women's employment and a potential loss of $1 trillion in GDP. The "take action now" scenario improves gender parity and adds $13 trillion to GDP. The "wait to take action" scenario assumes delayed action and results in a reduction of potential gains by more than $5 trillion.

Title: The Pandemic’s Toll on Women
Publisher: Foreign Affairs Magazine
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women, highlighting how it has affected them differently from men and exacerbated existing inequalities. The pandemic has had significant health, economic, and social consequences for women worldwide. Health: The article mentions the case of Sierra Leone, where the Ebola outbreak in 2014 led to a collapse of the health system, resulting in a sharp increase in maternal deaths. It warns that the COVID-19 pandemic could have a similar impact, particularly in lowand middle-income countries. Early data suggest that disruptions to maternal and reproductive health services during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to up to 113,000 maternal deaths in lowand middle-income countries. The article emphasizes the need to classify sexual and reproductive health care as "essential" services and protect the contraceptive supply chain to prevent unintended pregnancies. It also highlights the importance of ensuring personal protective equipment (PPE) that fits female health workers, as they make up 70% of the global health workforce. Economic Impact: The article references a study by Oxfam International and UN Women, which found that the Ebola epidemic had a disproportionate economic impact on women in affected regions. Women's incomes took much longer to recover compared to men's. Early estimates suggest that women's jobs are 1.8 times more likely to be cut during the COVID-19 recession than jobs held by men. The pandemic has also increased women's unpaid care work, as they bear a disproportionate burden of caring for children and family members while schools and care facilities remain closed. The article argues that the economic impact on women could stall progress toward gender equality, with significant economic costs. Policy Recommendations: The article calls for policymakers to recognize the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women and take targeted measures to address it. It recommends integrating women's health care services, ensuring that sexual and reproductive health care is classified as "essential," and protecting the contraceptive supply chain. To support women economically, the article suggests designing emergency cash transfers and stimulus packages that take into account the specific needs and realities of women, especially those who are economically marginalized. It also emphasizes the importance of reaching women through mobile phones, as they are often excluded from digital access and services. The article calls for recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work, arguing that it disempowers women and hurts economies. Inclusion of Women in Decision-making: The article highlights the underrepresentation of women in positions of power, such as heads of state and national lawmakers, and calls for their inclusion in decision-making processes related to the COVID-19 response. It argues that diverse women's perspectives are crucial in shaping policies and programs that effectively address the multifaceted impacts of the pandemic. The article gives examples of grassroots women's organizations in India that have played a crucial role in responding to the pandemic by manufacturing masks, PPE kits, and hand sanitizers. In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the gender dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic. By prioritizing women's health, economic empowerment, and inclusion in decision-making, societies can build a more prosperous, prepared, and equal future as they recover from the crisis.

Title: Coronavirus, Social and Physical Distancing and Self-Quarantine
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and "flatten the curve," the article recommends social and physical distancing, self-quarantine, and isolation for those infected. Social distancing means staying home and avoiding in-person contact as much as possible, while physical distancing refers to maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others and wearing face masks when outside the home. Self-quarantine is recommended for those exposed to the virus for 14 days to monitor for symptoms and prevent spreading the virus to others. Isolation is for those confirmed infected, and it involves separating the infected from the uninfected, either at home or in a healthcare facility. "Flattening the curve" aims to slow the infection rate so hospitals can manage patient numbers, beds, equipment, and healthcare providers. These practices, along with proper hygiene, can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the impact on healthcare facilities. Regarding forecasting hospitalizations, the article emphasizes that physical distancing, self-quarantine, and proper hygiene can help lower the number of severe cases that require hospitalization. By reducing the rate of infection, hospitals can better manage patient numbers and resources, preventing a sudden surge that could overwhelm their capacity. Thus, these preventive measures are crucial in forecasting and managing COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Economic impact of COVID-19 among Indigenous people
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indigenous people in Canada, particularly their employment, financial situation, and trust in government decisions. The data is derived from a crowdsourcing initiative and provides insights into the economic challenges faced by Indigenous communities during the pandemic. Key findings include: Indigenous participants were more likely than non-Indigenous participants to report a strong or moderate impact of COVID-19 on their ability to meet financial obligations or essential needs (36% vs. 25%). Among those employed before the pandemic, 37% of Indigenous participants experienced job loss or reduced work hours, similar to the rate among non-Indigenous participants (35%). Employment disruptions had a larger financial impact on Indigenous participants due to pre-existing vulnerabilities such as lower income and higher poverty rates. 44% of Indigenous participants who experienced a strong or moderate financial impact applied for federal income support, compared to 50% of non-Indigenous participants. Indigenous participants reported lower levels of trust in federal, provincial, and municipal governments and health authorities regarding reopening decisions. For example, 50% of Indigenous participants trusted the federal government's reopening decisions, compared to 62% of non-Indigenous participants. These findings highlight the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic on Indigenous communities and their lower trust in government decisions. The article is part of a series by Statistics Canada aimed at understanding the health, social, and economic challenges faced by Indigenous people during COVID-19. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, additional data on infection rates, severity of cases, and healthcare capacity in Indigenous communities would be necessary. However, the article provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic vulnerabilities of Indigenous people, which could impact their access to healthcare and their ability to manage the disease.

Title: COVID-19 Update: Residents Urged To Take Precautions As New Cases Emerge In Southwest And West-Central Saskatchewan
Publisher: Government of Saskatchewan
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: As of July 13, Saskatchewan reported 31 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 871. The regional breakdown of new cases includes 27 in the Central region, two in the Regina area, one in Saskatoon, and one in the South. Previously reported infections in the Southwest have spread to nearby areas, with cases identified in several Rural Municipalities. The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority are working with the Hutterian Safety Council to increase testing and contact tracing in these areas. Currently, there are 90 active cases in the province, with three people hospitalized, including two in intensive care. Of the total cases, 174 are travelers, 487 are community contacts, and 128 have no known exposures. The majority of cases are in adults, with 121 cases in individuals 19 years of age and under. Saskatchewan has conducted 75,161 COVID-19 tests, with a per capita testing rate lower than the national average. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, residents are urged to follow public health measures and safety precautions, including physical distancing, proper hygiene, and complying with health orders. Testing for COVID-19 will be available to anyone who requests it starting July 14, regardless of symptoms. With a capacity of 1,800 tests per day, the increased testing can help identify and contain new cases promptly. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the current active cases, the rate of transmission, and the effectiveness of public health measures and safety precautions. The number of hospitalizations (three) and intensive care patients (two) provides a snapshot of the current situation, but the trend in new cases and active cases will influence future hospitalization rates. The cooperation between health authorities and local communities is a positive step in managing the outbreak.

Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the potential long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of children and adolescents, especially those from vulnerable communities. While children have been less directly affected by the disease itself, the public health response and resulting social and economic impacts can increase stressors for young people. These stressors, such as family income loss, food insecurity, and parental stress, can have negative and lasting impacts on children's brain development, immune systems, and overall well-being. The authors highlight the importance of early life experiences in shaping adult health and the potential for biological embedding of these stressors through epigenetics. They call for immediate action to support children and families, including reopening schools safely, prioritizing child welfare in policy decisions, and advocating for investments in child health and education to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. The presence of supportive adults and the involvement of young people in decision-making are also emphasized as protective factors for children's development and resilience. Overall, the article underscores the urgency of addressing the basic needs and well-being of children and adolescents during the pandemic to prevent long-term harm and ensure a healthy future for the next generation.
