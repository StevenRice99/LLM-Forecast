There are currently seven long-term care facilities in New Brunswick, Canada, dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks, just weeks after the province lifted masking requirements for employees in these settings. The total number of outbreaks, the number of infections, and the breakdown of cases among residents and staff are unclear, as the province is no longer requiring homes with 10 or fewer residents to report outbreaks. One of the affected facilities, Carleton-Kirk Lodge in Saint John, has decided to close its doors to visitors to try and stop the spread. A concerned citizen, Jon Osborne, whose parents live in a nursing home, is calling for the return of the mask mandate to protect vulnerable individuals from severe COVID-19 outcomes. He argues that the province needs to be proactive rather than reactive in dealing with the airborne virus. The Coalition for Seniors and Nursing Home Residents' Rights also urges the government to reconsider its decision, emphasizing the need to protect those with low immune systems. The Department of Social Development did not respond to requests for an interview, but a spokesperson stated that masks remain available for those who wish to continue masking. The monitoring of outbreaks and the potential reimposition of the mask mandate are ongoing.

Title: Coupling wastewater surveillance and modelling of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, CCDR 49(5)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) is a valuable tool for monitoring the prevalence of COVID-19, particularly during the Omicron wave when clinical testing capacities were overwhelmed. WBS involves analyzing the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to estimate community infection rates, capturing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This method is not limited by underdiagnosis or testing capacity and can provide early indications of COVID-19 presence. Canada has implemented a national WBS program, with a focus on five major cities, that utilizes mathematical modeling to interpret WBS data and forecast case numbers. The process involves collaboration between multiple government divisions, agencies, and laboratories. However, WBS data can be influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, laboratory protocols, and wastewater treatment plant engineering, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols to ensure accuracy. Overall, WBS offers a complementary, non-invasive, and low-cost method to enhance COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health strategies.

The summary of the article is that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 is no longer a global health emergency as of May 5, 2023, signifying the end of the pandemic's emergency phase. To discuss this milestone, the Institute for Pandemics is organizing an online webinar featuring Fahad Razak, past Scientific Director of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, and a panel of the Institute's leaders. The panel will reflect on the lessons learned during the pandemic, the future evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and how to enhance pandemic preparedness. This event aims to provide valuable insights and guidance for the post-pandemic era. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to recognize that the pandemic's impact on healthcare systems is expected to decrease significantly now that the WHO has lifted the global health emergency. However, it doesn't mean that all hospitals will be free from COVID-19 patients. Here are some key points to consider: 1. Ongoing Surveillance and Monitoring: Even though the pandemic's acute phase is over, health authorities will continue surveillance and monitoring for COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. This data will help identify any potential new waves or outbreaks. 2. Local Variations: The incidence of COVID-19 hospitalizations can vary by region and even within different areas of the same country. Local factors such as vaccination rates, previous infection rates, and the prevalence of new variants can influence hospitalization rates. 3. Impact of Variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can impact hospitalization forecasts. Some variants may be more transmissible or cause more severe disease, leading to an increase in hospitalizations. Conversely, if a new variant is less severe, hospitalizations may decrease. 4. Healthcare System Capacity: The capacity and resilience of healthcare systems vary globally and even within a country. Regions with limited healthcare resources may experience higher hospitalization rates or struggle to manage even a small surge in cases. 5. Seasonal Variations: COVID-19 hospitalizations may exhibit seasonal patterns, with potential increases during winter months or periods of indoor gatherings. 6. Vaccination and Booster Campaigns: Vaccination rates and booster campaigns can significantly influence hospitalization forecasts. High vaccination coverage generally results in lower hospitalization rates. 7. Preparedness and Response Plans: Healthcare systems should continue to maintain preparedness plans, including surge capacity, to manage potential future waves or outbreaks effectively. 8. Impact of Co-circulation with Other Respiratory Viruses: COVID-19 may co-circulate with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, which could impact hospitalization rates during certain seasons. 9. Long COVID Considerations: The impact of Long COVID, where symptoms persist for months, should also be considered in forecasting healthcare needs, as it may lead to ongoing hospitalizations or the need for specialized care. 10. Healthcare Seeking Behavior: The behavior of individuals, such as their willingness to seek medical care for COVID-19 symptoms, can also influence hospitalization rates. In conclusion, while the lifting of the global health emergency signifies a positive step forward, it is important to remain vigilant and continue monitoring COVID-19 hospitalizations. Accurate forecasting will depend on a combination of factors, including local dynamics, variant behavior, healthcare system capacity, and the effectiveness of ongoing public health measures and vaccination campaigns.

Title: Robust and prototypical immune responses toward COVID-19 vaccine in First Nations peoples are impacted by comorbidities
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article investigates the immune response to the mRNA vaccine in Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous (NI) individuals. The study found that both groups had robust antibody and neutralizing responses after vaccination, but Indigenous Australians had slightly lower antibody levels and higher levels of a pro-inflammatory type of antibody. The presence of chronic medical conditions (CMs) such as diabetes and renal disease was associated with reduced vaccine-induced antibody responses and increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in both Indigenous and NI individuals. The frequency of spike-specific memory B cells was also lower in individuals with CMs. Overall, the study suggests that CMs may impact the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in Indigenous populations. This could have implications for hospitalization rates and the need for additional vaccine doses or boosters in these communities.

Title: Covid: Top Chinese scientist says don’t rule out lab leak
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 virus and the possibility of a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. Prof George Gao, a former top Chinese government scientist, suggests that the lab leak theory should not be ruled out completely, contradicting the official stance of the Chinese government. Prof Gao also reveals that some kind of formal investigation into the WIV was conducted by the Chinese government, though he has not seen the results. Prof Wang Linfa, a Singapore-based scientist and collaborator of Prof Shi Zhengli from the WIV, provides insight into the early days of the outbreak. He shares that Prof Shi briefly worried about the possibility of a lab leak but found no evidence of the COVID-19 virus or any similar virus in her samples. Prof Wang also mentions that Prof Shi and her team showed no signs of hiding anything and that blood samples taken in January 2020 showed no COVID-19 antibodies. The article also highlights the conflicting views of scientists on the origin of the virus. Some believe that the evidence points to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source, while others, like Prof Ian Lipkin, suggest that the market may have amplified the spread but was not necessarily the origin. Prof Lipkin proposes another Wuhan laboratory, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, as a possible source due to its close proximity to the market and involvement in bat sample collection. While Prof Gao's comments seem to contradict China's official position, they share the idea that there is a lack of evidence to determine the origin definitively. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of finding the true origins of COVID-19 and the need for more transparency and cooperation from China in the investigation.

The article discusses the criticism and potential legal consequences faced by French researcher Didier Raoult and his team for their controversial use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. Raoult, a respected tropical disease specialist, endorsed the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early days of the pandemic, which gained traction due to support from former US President Donald Trump and Brazil's then-leader Jair Bolsonaro. However, multiple medical bodies in France have accused Raoult and his subordinates of engaging in an unauthorized clinical trial, prescribing hydroxychloroquine, zinc, ivermectin, and azithromycin to COVID-19 patients without solid evidence of their effectiveness. The medications were continued even after their ineffectiveness was demonstrated, raising concerns about patient safety and the credibility of French medical research. The French government has requested an investigation into the conduct of the IHU Mediterranee research hospital, where Raoult was formerly the head. Health Minister Francois Braun has confirmed that Raoult's recent study on treating over 30,000 COVID-19 patients will be included in the probe. As a result, all clinical trials at the IHU Mediterranee have been suspended, and the hospital is awaiting approval from the drug regulator before resuming trials. This situation highlights the importance of scientific peer review and evidence-based medicine in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases, especially when it comes to forecasting hospitalizations and determining the most effective treatments.
