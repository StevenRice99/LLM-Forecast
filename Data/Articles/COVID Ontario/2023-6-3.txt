TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Ottawa's medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, states that COVID-19 has not disappeared and is still present in the community, but the situation is more stable with fewer serious outcomes. The current wastewater signal in Ottawa is fairly flat, hospitalizations are down, and the number of deaths from COVID-19 is the lowest it's been since last June. Epidemiologists Raywat Deonandan and Dr. Fahad Razak suggest that COVID-19 may be entering a "hyper-endemic phase" or an "adaptive phase", where a large number of cases are expected to occur consistently. Razak recommends resuming COVID-19 modeling to prepare for potential future surges and focusing on protecting high-risk individuals, such as the immunocompromised, disabled, and elderly. Deonandan emphasizes the importance of continued mask-wearing in crowded spaces and staying home when sick to protect high-risk individuals. The article highlights the need for public health officials to focus on protecting high-risk individuals, particularly those who have not received their second booster shot (fourth dose). The article also mentions that Ontario recommends high-risk people receive a booster shot if it's been six months since their last dose or last confirmed case of COVID-19. These points suggest that while the pandemic may be in a more stable phase, there is still a need for continued vigilance and precautions to protect high-risk individuals and prepare for potential future surges.
