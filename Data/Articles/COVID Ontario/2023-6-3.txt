Title: Antipsychotic drugs use increased in Canadian long-term care homes, pointing to possible quality-of-care issues: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Summary: The study found an increase in antipsychotic drug use in long-term care homes across Canada, including Ontario, between 2019/2020 and 2020/2021. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada from this article include:
Antipsychotic drug usage rates in Ontario (18.3% in 2019/2020 to 19.3% in 2020/2021)
Risk-adjusted odds of potentially inappropriate antipsychotic drug use in Ontario (10% increase compared to the pre-pandemic period)

The study compared Canada's COVID-19 response with that of other countries (US, UK, Australia, and France) using data from March 1, 2020 to May 1, 2022. Here are the key findings:
Methodology: 
The researchers used a model-based approach to estimate outcomes averted due to different pandemic responses.
They employed the Oxford Pandemic Stringency Index (PSI) to quantify the stringency of pandemic control measures in each country.
Key Findings: 
1. Canada vs US and UK: Canada's response was more effective than that of the US and UK, resulting in a larger number of deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions averted.
2. Canada vs France: While Canada outperformed France, the difference was less pronounced compared to the other two countries (US and UK).
3. Australia's elimination strategy: The study suggests that Australia's disease control stance focused on elimination rather than mitigation would have resulted in further health and economic benefits.
Limitations: 
The analysis relies on estimates of outcomes averted, which represent lower bounds for all countries.
The researchers used Ontario-specific data to estimate national outcomes, assuming similar epidemiology across Canada.
Attribution of COVID-19 deaths may have been more accurate in the UK than in Canada, and underreported in Australia.
Funding: 
The research was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
Overall, the study highlights the importance of effective pandemic response strategies and suggests that Canada's approach was relatively successful compared to other developed countries.

Title: National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) statement: Seasonal influenza vaccine for 2023-2024

Trusted: True

Based on the provided text, here are some key points related to the recommendation for pregnant individuals:
1. Pregnant individuals should receive IIV or RIV: The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that any age-appropriate Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) or Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV), but not Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), should be offered to pregnant individuals.
2. No specific guidelines for trimester: The text does not specify different recommendations based on the stage of pregnancy (first, second, or third trimester).
3. Safety data available for IIV during pregnancy: Although limited published clinical data were initially mentioned regarding safety of vaccination with RIV4 during pregnancy, it is noted that active studies of influenza vaccination during pregnancy have shown no evidence of harm to the pregnant individual or fetus associated with influenza vaccination.
4. No recommendation against vaccination due to theoretical risk: Unlike LAIV, IIV does not pose a significant theoretical risk to the fetus; hence, vaccination is recommended despite limited data on RIV4's safety.
5. All individuals who are pregnant are particularly recommended for vaccination: NACI recommends that all individuals who are pregnant, at any stage of pregnancy, should receive IIV or RIV as they are particularly recommended recipients due to their increased risk of influenza-related morbidity and complications during pregnancy.
