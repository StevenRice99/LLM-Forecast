Title: COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan 2022: Global Monitoring and Evaluation Framework
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The SPRP 2022 Global Monitoring and Evaluation Framework provides a structure for monitoring and evaluating the global response to COVID-19, including the implementation of the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) by Member States with WHO support. The goal is to provide timely information and analysis to inform strategic decision-making and course correction. By tracking and evaluating the response progress and the evolving COVID-19 situation, this framework aims to support countries, partners, and the WHO in making evidence-based decisions to strengthen and sustain the response to the pandemic. This includes forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, which is a critical aspect of healthcare capacity planning and ensuring that healthcare systems are prepared to handle surges in COVID-19 cases. The framework emphasizes the importance of accountability, transparency, and operational tracking to inform strategic adjustments and ensure an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Ontario reports 72 new COVID-19 deaths as wastewater signals climb once again
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario reported 72 new COVID-19-related deaths and an increase in hospitalizations due to the virus, indicating a potential upward trend in cases. The test positivity rate dropped slightly, but wastewater signals, which can predict virus trends, are rising again. The increase in hospitalizations and wastewater signals suggest a potential rise in COVID-19 cases in Ontario, with the Central East and West regions seeing the steepest climbs. This comes as vaccine bookings for the Omicron variant open to all adults, with lower-than-expected uptake among the youngest age groups. The current wave, fueled by the Omicron BA.5 variant, has experts concerned about the accuracy of reported case counts. Ontario's removal of COVID-19 isolation requirements has also faced criticism from experts.

Title: NWT Chief Public Health Officer to expand ways to detect COVID-19 in population
Publisher: Government of Northwest Territories
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The GNWT plans to test blood samples from NWT residents for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, to understand the extent of COVID-19 spread and population immunity in the territory. The samples will be collected from April 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, and will be anonymous to protect residents' privacy. This is an important initiative to help forecast and plan for future waves of COVID-19 and its impact on the health system. As of August 31, 2022, there have been a total of 35 hospitalizations, 4 ICU admissions, and 4 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the NWT since April 1, 2022. There have been no hospitalizations for children under five in this period. The NWT is also monitoring wastewater for COVID-19 activity and has expanded this monitoring to include Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The GNWT takes the privacy of its residents seriously and has completed a legal and privacy review of the blood sample testing initiative. The results of the seroprevalence surveys will be made available to the public to help understand the impact of COVID-19 and optimize health system planning.

Title: Canada to end COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements
Publisher: Dentons
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Sure! Here is a summary of the article: Canada will lift all COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements as of October 1st, 2022, which includes: No need for travellers to submit quarantine and vaccination information through ArriveCAN. No need to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination. No need for pre-or post-arrival COVID-19 testing. No need to self-quarantine or self-isolate after arriving in Canada. Monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19 after arrival in Canada is no longer required. Transport Canada's COVID-19 measures will also end, meaning travellers don't need to provide proof of vaccination for air and water travel, undergo health checks for plane and train travel, or wear masks on planes and trains (although it is still recommended). However, travellers should still follow provincial or territorial COVID-19 requirements and meet entry requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Those with COVID-19 symptoms should avoid travelling and inform relevant staff if symptoms develop during travel. This relaxation of restrictions is due to several factors, including passing the peak of the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 wave, high vaccination rates, lower hospitalization and death rates, and the availability of vaccine boosters. As for forecasting hospitalizations, the article doesn't provide specific data or models. However, the Canadian government's decision to lift restrictions suggests they anticipate a continued decline in hospitalizations and severe cases, given the factors mentioned above.

Title: Rapid tests available to McMaster community ahead of reading week
Publisher: McMaster COVID-19
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: In an effort to promote the well-being of the McMaster community, COVID-19 rapid antigen test kits will be distributed before the fall reading week, with each kit containing five individual tests. The distribution will take place on a first-come, first-served basis at the McMaster University Student Centre on October 5, 2022, from 9 am to 4 pm, or until supplies last. The test kits are limited to one per person and are available to McMaster students, faculty, and staff. This initiative aims to help individuals monitor their health status and take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of staying home and using the Ontario COVID-19 self-assessment tool if one feels unwell or exhibits any COVID-19 symptoms. It also outlines the reporting protocols for positive cases among employees and students in health professional programs. Employees who test positive and have been on campus in the past 14 days are required to complete the COVID-19 Positive Case Reporting Tool in Mosaic. While students are no longer required to report cases, those in health professional programs may have separate instructions from their program offices for reporting to placement locations. By providing rapid tests and encouraging self-assessment and reporting, McMaster University is taking proactive measures to manage COVID-19 cases and support the health and safety of its community. These efforts can help identify potential outbreaks and inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations, particularly as individuals return to campus after the reading week.

Title: Study confirms link between COVID-19 vaccination and temporary increase in menstrual cycle length
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The study found that COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a temporary increase in menstrual cycle length of less than one day on average. This change is considered within the normal range of variation and was not associated with any changes in the number of days of bleeding. The study included data from nearly 20,000 people worldwide who received various COVID-19 vaccines, and the increase in cycle length was similar regardless of the type of vaccine used. Most participants' cycles returned to normal in the month after vaccination. While small changes in the menstrual cycle may not be concerning to healthcare professionals, understanding these changes can help address concerns and reduce vaccine hesitancy. The study did not find any significant increases in hospitalization due to COVID-19, but it focused primarily on menstrual cycle changes.

Title: Global study finds COVID-19 vaccination can affect menstrual cycle
Publisher: OHSU News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The study, published in the journal BMJ Medicine, found that some people may experience a slight and temporary change in their menstrual cycle length after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. The research was led by Alison Edelman, a clinician-scientist at Oregon Health & Science University, and built on her team's previous work that identified an association between COVID-19 vaccines and menstrual cycle changes. The study analyzed data from an international cohort of nearly 20,000 individuals using a menstrual cycle tracking application. The findings showed that vaccinated individuals experienced an average increase in cycle length of less than one day per cycle in which they received a dose, while those who received two doses in a single cycle had an average increase of 3.7 days compared to the unvaccinated group. The study also found that a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals (13.5%) experienced an increase in cycle length of more than eight days, compared to 5% in the unvaccinated group. Changes in cycle length were similar across different vaccine types. Edelman emphasized that the menstrual cycle changes are small at the population level and typically resolve in the cycle after vaccination. The research was important in validating the experiences of many individuals and providing better care and clinical recommendations. While the study did not investigate the biological mechanism behind these changes, researchers believe it is likely due to a temporary immune response activation. Understanding COVID-19-related menstrual cycle changes can help forecast hospitalizations by providing insight into the vaccine's temporary side effects.

Title: Did COVID-19 Trigger a “New Normal” in Trade Policy?
Publisher: IISD Reporting Services
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade policy decisions and commercial policy interventions. Here is a summary, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article examines if there have been any structural changes in commercial policy decisions two and a half years after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. It questions if the pandemic has led to any long-term shifts in the extent of state discrimination against foreign-supplied goods and services, or if it has only caused temporary changes in the amount of policy intervention. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat distinguishes between COVID-19 related measures and other policy interventions in its reports, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the findings due to the dependence on WTO members' self-reporting. The overall finding of the WTO Secretariat's report is that COVID-19 was a shock that is now abating in trade policy terms, but not in health terms. The author uses the independent Global Trade Alert (GTA) database to analyze commercial policy interventions, without attributing specific actions to the pandemic. The GTA database records information on various state acts and policy interventions that can affect cross-border commercial flows, including subsidies, import restrictions, and export controls. The pandemic has increased the number of commercial policy interventions, with a total of 5,885 state acts in 2020 and 4,016 recorded so far for 2021. However, the share of interventions favoring national firms over foreign competitors has remained stable since 2009, with only one-fifth of interventions liberalizing cross-border commerce. The pandemic has led to a greater use of corporate subsidy awards and export curbs, with export bans in 2020 being 50 times higher than the average in the previous five years. The harm caused by export curbs on medical equipment and vaccine distribution during the pandemic may have longer-term consequences on the willingness of governments to source medical items from abroad. The author concludes that the pandemic has affected the quantity but not the quality of commercial policy interventions, and that there is a need for aggressive monitoring of state actions to build and retain confidence in international supply chains. The article provides an analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade policies and commercial interventions, suggesting that while the quantity of interventions has increased, the overall trajectory towards a distorted world trading system has not changed significantly. The export curbs on medical supplies and vaccines during the pandemic may have eroded trust in international supply chains, potentially leading to longer-term consequences.
