This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of COVID-19 positive patients in Ontario hospitals has increased by 11% week-over-week, from 1,141 to 1,265. The number of patients in intensive care has also risen, from 129 to 133. Wastewater surveillance data from Public Health Ontario suggests an increase in active infections in most parts of the province. The positivity rate on PCR testing has increased from 11.98% to 12.42%. The number of new cases detected through PCR testing has risen for the third week in a row, to 8,627.

Title: Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 antivirals are sitting on shelves across Canada

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Paxlovid, an antiviral medication, has been shown to significantly reduce hospitalizations and deaths among people most at risk from COVID-19, such as seniors and people with compromised immune systems. Despite Health Canada distributing enough Paxlovid to treat over 700,000 people, provinces have dispensed less than 15% of their supply, leaving hundreds of thousands of treatment courses unused. Medical professionals are concerned that many Canadians who could benefit from Paxlovid are unaware of its availability, and that the medication is not being used effectively to prevent hospitalizations. Ontario's health ministry did not provide data on Paxlovid usage, but other provinces reported low uptake, ranging from 12% to 76%. The article highlights the importance of making people aware of Paxlovid and its benefits, particularly for seniors and those with compromised immune systems, to prevent hospitalizations and reduce the strain on the healthcare system. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of Paxlovid treatment courses distributed to Ontario and the percentage of those dispensed to patients. The eligibility criteria for Paxlovid in Ontario and any changes to those criteria. The awareness and knowledge of Paxlovid among healthcare providers and the general public in Ontario. The potential impact of increased Paxlovid usage on hospitalization rates in Ontario, particularly among seniors and those with compromised immune systems.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The availability of bivalent COVID-19 vaccine boosters to anyone in Ontario 18 or older may lead to an increase in vaccination rates, which could help reduce hospitalizations. The recommended interval for the bivalent booster is 168 days since a previous dose, and the minimum interval is 84 days. According to Ottawa Public Health (OPH) data, just over 207,000 residents of Ottawa have had at least four doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, with most people with a fourth dose being 60 or older. The new paediatric Pfizer vaccine is available for children aged between six months to under five years old, which may lead to an increase in vaccination rates among this age group. Vaccination rates among children six months to four years in Ottawa are currently low, with 16% having had one dose and 1% having had at least two doses. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide information on vaccination rates, booster shot availability, and vaccination rates among specific age groups, which can help inform predictions of future hospitalization rates.
