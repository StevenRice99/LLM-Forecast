Publisher: CTV News

Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: The Region of Peel in Ontario has a high positivity rate of 18.5%, nearly three times higher than the province as a whole. The region's high case counts are attributed to the types of industries located there, such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distributing, which cannot be done from home and have not been affected by provincial closures and shutdowns. Many workers in these industries come from racialized or new immigrant communities and are precariously employed, making them less likely to miss work if they're feeling unwell. The region has implemented strict measures, including bans on large gatherings, shutting down non-essential businesses, and temporarily closing an Amazon warehouse. The region has also focused on delivering vaccines, with all Peel adults over 18 able to book a vaccine appointment and a goal of administering 18,000 doses per day. The medical officer of health, Dr. Lawrence Loh, is cautiously optimistic about the situation improving but emphasizes the need for a gradual reopening to avoid another surge in cases. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as they provide insight into the region's high case counts, the effectiveness of strict measures, and the progress of vaccination efforts.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The weight of the pandemic is shifting to younger people, with hospitalizations and ICU admissions increasing among people under 60, particularly in those under 50. The number of people over 70 who died from COVID-19 decreased by 77% between March 26 and April 23, while hospitalizations and ICU admissions also decreased. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions increased among people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, with hospitalizations growing by 40%, 40%, and 65%, respectively, and ICU admissions growing by 57%, 57%, and 60%, respectively. The third wave is outpacing previous waves, with record-high daily case loads and hospitalizations in Ontario, Alberta, and B.C. More than 1,400 people are currently in intensive care with COVID-19 in Canada, with a higher proportion of them under the age of 70. These values suggest that forecasting models should take into account the shifting demographics of COVID-19 hospitalizations, with a focus on younger age groups, and the increasing severity of the third wave.
