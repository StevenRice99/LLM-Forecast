Title: Addressing vaccine hesitancy in the context of COVID-19: A primer for health care providers
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This article is a guide for healthcare providers in Canada to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among their patients and the general public. It defines vaccine hesitancy as a reluctance or refusal to vaccinate, despite the availability of vaccines, and acknowledges that it is a significant barrier to ending the pandemic. Most Canadians intend to get vaccinated, but a portion of the population remains hesitant, including some healthcare providers. The article identifies specific subgroups, such as Black Canadians, Indigenous peoples, newcomers, and younger adults, who are more likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. It also outlines a '5C' model summarizing key factors influencing vaccine hesitancy: Confidence, Complacency, Convenience, Calculation, and Collective Responsibility. The article provides strategies for healthcare providers to build vaccine confidence, including using presumptive statements, cultivating a safe space for discussions, activating positive emotions, and avoiding judgment.

Title: Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) Following Adenovirus Vector COVID-19 Vaccination
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article provides information for healthcare professionals about Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), a rare adverse reaction to adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson. VITT is characterized by blood clots in the brain and other vital organs, occurring 4 to 28 days post-vaccination, and associated with a low platelet count. Published estimates suggest that VITT affects 1 in 26,000 to 1 in 127,000 individuals vaccinated with AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, with rates varying by country. As of April 28, 2021, Canada reported a rate of approximately 1 per 100,000 doses. For the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the incidence is approximately 1 case per 500,000 doses. While it is unclear if specific individuals are more prone to VITT, those with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) and low platelet counts are advised to opt for mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna). Symptoms indicative of VITT include persistent severe headaches, seizure, vision problems, difficulty speaking or moving body parts, shortness of breath, severe chest/abdominal pain, unusual bleeding, and severe swelling or pain in the limbs. VITT can be successfully treated if recognized early, and guidelines have been published to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment. Despite the rare risk of VITT, Health Canada and other regulatory agencies continue to recommend adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines due to their effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations, severe illness, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Title: Remdesivir for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that may reduce mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate illness who require supplemental low-flow oxygen. The benefits of remdesivir for critically ill patients on high-flow nasal cannula, mask, or non-invasive mechanical ventilation are uncertain. Remdesivir does not benefit and may harm critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and provides no substantial benefit to hospitalized patients who don't require supplemental oxygen. Remdesivir has comparable effects when used for 5 or 10 days and is not associated with significant adverse effects. The recommendation is to use remdesivir for moderately ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen and consider it for patients on high-flow nasal cannula, mask, or non-invasive ventilation. Remdesivir is not advised for the critically ill or those not needing supplemental oxygen. Remdesivir's effectiveness was analyzed in four worldwide randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared it to a placebo or standard care. Two trials were extensive. When analyzed together, the trials indicated that remdesivir might reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation need and speed up recovery in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate illness. The supply of remdesivir in Ontario is limited, so doctors should be selective about its use. The recommendation is to administer remdesivir to hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate illness requiring supplemental oxygen. It may be considered for patients needing more oxygen support but not mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir is not advised for mildly or critically ill patients. This information can assist in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying which patient groups may benefit from remdesivir treatment, thereby reducing the need for hospitalization or intensive care.

Title: Paisley Sim: COVID-19 Policy Stringency across Provinces
Publisher: McGill University
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the varying levels of COVID-19 restrictions in different Canadian provinces and territories, with a focus on Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. The COVID-19 Stringency Index, developed by the Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP), measures the relative stringency of policies in place and models policy change over time. The index captures 12 different measures enacted by provincial governments, including gathering sizes, masks, school closures, and travel restrictions. Alberta declared a public health emergency on March 17, 2020, and its response has been characterized by a reluctance to introduce restrictions, focusing more on personal accountability and reopening the economy. The province has consistently allowed larger gathering sizes than elsewhere in Canada and has recommended but not required residents to stay at home and limit travel. Alberta has also been slow to adopt mask mandates, with Calgary and Edmonton implementing their own mandates in August 2020, while the province did not extend a province-wide mandate until December. Schools reopened in early September, with mask requirements for students in grades four and above. Alberta faced rising variant cases in April 2021 and had the highest cases per capita in Canada at the end of that month. Ontario, with a population of over 14.5 million, had the largest number of confirmed cases in Canada as of May 7, 2021. The province's response has been incremental and slower relative to other provinces, with a complex command structure that has led to delays and confusion. Ontario introduced a reopening framework in November 2020 with five levels of restrictions based on transmission rates. A report by the Ontario Auditor General characterized the province's response as slower than other provinces, with a cumbersome command structure that was not led by public health expertise. Ontario transitioned to appointment-based testing in October 2020 and implemented a province-wide shutdown on December 26, 2020. The province projected the B.1.1.7 variant to become dominant in March 2021 and closed schools for remote learning in April. Ontario has not restricted intra-provincial travel but closed borders with Manitoba and Quebec to travellers in April 2021. Quebec was the first province to declare a public health emergency on March 14, 2020, due to high early viral transmission and limited preparedness. The province's response has been quicker to introduce restrictions, with a strict lockdown in the spring of 2020 and a nightly curfew beginning in January 2021. Quebec students went on spring break a week earlier than other provinces, which researchers linked to the rise in early case numbers. Schools closed on March 13, 2020, and the province announced that according to a Google study, it was the first jurisdiction in North America to enter confinement. Nova Scotia, along with Newfoundland and Labrador, is focused on controlling transmission and permits gatherings of up to 100 people indoors. The article concludes that the varied approach to introducing public health restrictions and the subjective definitions of "strong" restrictions have led to confusion and questioning among Canadians. The COVID-19 Stringency Index provides a basis for objective analysis and a better understanding of the relative stringency of COVID-19 policies in different provinces.

Title: Why Ontario had to transfer thousands of Toronto COVID-19 patients to other cities’ hospitals
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, over 2,500 patients had to be transferred from Toronto to other cities to receive critical care. The main reasons for this were a lack of hospital beds and healthcare workers in Toronto. This crisis has exposed two fallacies in the province's healthcare system: the belief that Ontario has enough hospital beds because most medical care is outpatient, and the belief that Canada has a sufficient number of healthcare workers and doctors. In reality, as medicine becomes more advanced and is offered to older and higher-risk patients, more hospital beds are needed. Pre-pandemic, Ontario's hospitals were already operating at 96% occupancy. The pandemic has simply made the lack of reserve capacity more apparent. To deal with the pandemic, Ontario Health relocated patients, canceled elective procedures, and opened new hospital beds. However, moving patients away from their families and relying on deferring elective procedures are not sustainable solutions. Canada also relies heavily on international medical graduates to meet its physician needs, as the number of Canadian-trained doctors is insufficient. This is despite a high demand for medical education in Canada, with schools receiving many more applicants than they can accept. Canada's physician-to-population ratio is low compared to other OECD nations. The cost of healthcare workers is a significant factor in this shortage, as provincial governments try to control costs by limiting the number of physicians and hospital beds. To create a more resilient healthcare system, Canada needs to invest in surge capacity by funding new beds created during the pandemic and ensuring an adequate supply of domestically trained healthcare professionals.

Title: 'The system failed the people of Brampton': How COVID-19 is taking a toll in hard-hit city
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Brampton, Ontario has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a test positivity rate more than double the provincial average. The city is home to a large number of South Asian immigrants and essential workers, many of whom live in multigenerational homes. The intersection of these factors has led to a high rate of infection and hospitalization in the region. Residents and healthcare professionals argue that the government has not done enough to protect workers, citing insufficient paid sick days and a slow vaccine rollout. Additionally, hospitals in the region have been underfunded for years, further exacerbating the issue. To address the situation, experts are calling for a multi-faceted approach that includes improved workplace safety measures, such as mandatory rapid testing and improved personal protective equipment. The Ontario government has recently increased vaccination sites and dedicated additional vaccine allocations to Peel Region, but more needs to be done to support the hard-hit community.

Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural businesses in Canada, using data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions (CSBC) for the first quarter of 2021. It compares the experiences of rural businesses with those in urban areas, covering topics such as challenges, remote work, online sales, ownership changes, operational status, and revenue changes. Challenges and Obstacles: Rising input costs, supply chain issues, fluctuating consumer demand, and skilled employee recruitment/retention are the main short-term challenges for rural businesses. 40% foresee rising input costs as a problem. Over a third of rural businesses cite supply chain challenges and consumer demand fluctuations as concerns. About 27% struggle with recruiting and retaining skilled employees. Remote Work and Online Sales: 17.5% of rural businesses offer remote work options, compared to 35.1% in urban areas. In the retail trade industry, 16.2% of rural businesses offer remote work, outpacing urban businesses at 12.8%. 6.3% of rural businesses made 30% or more sales online in 2020, while this figure was 13.2% for urban businesses. Ownership Changes: Nearly 70% of rural and urban businesses have no plans to sell, close, or transfer ownership within a year. Industries with notable differences include arts/entertainment/recreation, accommodation/food services, and real estate, with more rural businesses contemplating ownership changes. Operational Status: 47.7% of rural businesses remained fully operational during the pandemic, compared to 38.6% of urban businesses. Industries like accommodation/food services and arts/entertainment/recreation were most impacted, with few businesses remaining fully operational. Revenue Changes: 45.8% of rural businesses experienced a revenue decline of 10% or more in 2020 compared to 2019, while this figure was higher at 57.4% for urban businesses. Wholesale trade, administrative services, and retail trade showed the most significant rural-urban differences in revenue decreases. Overall, rural businesses in Canada faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic but demonstrated resilience with a higher proportion remaining operational and experiencing smaller revenue declines compared to their urban counterparts. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered, including vaccination rates, severity of infections, and healthcare capacity. However, these forecasts are complex and depend on various variables, including the prevalence of new variants and adherence to public health measures.

Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: School closures and COVID-19: Interactive Tool This interactive tool provides insights into the impact of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly on children and youth in Canada. It highlights potential challenges and vulnerabilities that may influence their learning, academic success, physical and mental health, and overall well-being. Learning and Academic Success: School closures and remote learning may negatively affect students' learning, especially those who struggle with online education. Access to the internet and suitable devices is crucial. Lower-income households face greater challenges, with 4.2% lacking internet access compared to 0.2% in the highest income quartile. Only 60% of 15-year-old students attended schools with sufficient resources for remote learning before the pandemic. Parental education influences children's academic engagement during the pandemic. 80% of participants with a bachelor's degree reported their children engaging in structured academic activities at least thrice weekly. Physical Activity and Fitness: School closures and the pandemic may reduce children's physical activity, increasing screen time. In summer 2020, 64% of parents were concerned about their children's screen time, with 90% engaging daily or almost daily. Before the pandemic, 61% of children and youth did not meet Canadian physical activity guidelines. Mental Health and Wellbeing: Remote learning and school closures can lead to feelings of isolation and learning challenges, impacting mental health. Youth aged 15-24 reported the highest negative impact on mental health (64%) and moderate to severe anxiety (41%) during the early months of the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, 17% of children and youth aged 5-17 reported poor or fair mental health, with higher rates among females. There are discrepancies between parents' and children's perceptions of mental health, with 65% of youth rating their mental health less positively than their parents. Vulnerable Populations: Children with disabilities may face more challenges with remote learning and require more parental support. Pre-pandemic, 8% of children aged 5-17 in Canada had a learning disability. Communities with lower parental education levels may be more vulnerable to the impacts of school closures. These insights can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying at-risk populations and understanding the potential long-term effects of school closures on children's health and well-being.

Title: UBC researchers unveil first molecular images of B.1.1.7 COVID-19 mutation
Publisher: UBC Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
UBC researchers have captured structural images of the N501Y mutation on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a key mutation in the B.1.1.7 variant (first detected in the UK). The images reveal that the mutation causes localized changes, affecting the portion of the spike protein that binds to human cells. Despite the increased infectivity of this variant, the research suggests that existing vaccines are likely to remain effective. This is because the N501Y mutant can still be neutralized by antibodies that block the unmutated virus, indicating that vaccines should still provide protection against mild and severe cases caused by the B.1.1.7 variant. The research team is also studying other COVID-19 variants, including the Brazilian, South African, Californian, and Indian variants, to understand how their mutations impact the interaction between the spike protein and neutralizing antibodies, as well as the binding to human cells. This work is crucial for determining the effectiveness of current treatments and vaccines against emerging variants and for developing strategies to control their spread. Key facts to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The B.1.1.7 variant is more infectious due to the N501Y mutation, leading to a higher number of cases. Existing vaccines are likely to remain effective against this variant, reducing the severity of cases and hospitalizations. Understanding the molecular structure of emerging variants is essential for predicting their impact on hospitalizations and developing effective control measures.
