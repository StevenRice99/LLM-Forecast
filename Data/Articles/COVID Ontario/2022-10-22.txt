Title: Impact of COVID-19 in adults with chronic conditions: Emergency department visits
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Overview: The article analyzes data from emergency department visits (EDVs) for adults in Canada with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 to understand the impact on those with chronic conditions. Summary of Characteristics and Outcomes: Analyzed 97,939 adult EDVs with confirmed (69.3%) or suspected (30.7%) COVID-19. 49.6% male, average age 52, 28.9% arrived by ambulance, 74.4% triaged as urgent or more serious. 22.3% had at least one of 18 chronic conditions, most commonly hypertension (11.8%), diabetes mellitus (9.4%), and ischemic heart disease (5.3%). Regarding healthcare use, 28.6% had an EDV and 7.9% had an acute care hospitalization in the past 6 months. 23.8% were admitted/transferred to acute care, 0.2% died. Characteristics of Patients with Severe Outcomes: Severe outcomes (admission, transfer to acute care, death) were more likely in males (55.6%), older adults (avg. age 67), and those with previous EDVs/hospitalizations. Severe outcomes increased with age, ranging from 5.7% in 20-34-year-olds to 69.1% in those 80+. Males had higher rates of severe outcomes across all ages. Adults with severe outcomes were more likely to have chronic conditions, especially hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The presence of multiple chronic conditions increased the likelihood of severe outcomes, ranging from 15.7% for no conditions to 71.1% for 4 or more conditions. Forecasting Hospitalizations: The presence of chronic conditions, especially multiple conditions, and increasing age were strong indicators of severe outcomes, including hospitalizations. By identifying high-risk groups, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions, public health measures and resources can be targeted to prevent infections and reduce hospitalizations. Recommendations to Reduce Infections and Severe Disease: Get vaccinated and boosted. Stay home when sick. Improve ventilation and wear masks in high-risk settings. Practice hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces.

Title: Excess Savings during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Federal Reserve
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the excess savings accumulated by U.S. households during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy. From 2020 through the summer of 2021, U.S. households accumulated approximately $2.3 trillion in excess savings due to increased government transfers and reduced spending caused by social distancing. As of mid-2022, households in the lower half of the income distribution still held about $350 billion in excess savings, while those in the top half held about $1.35 trillion. The increase in savings for lower-income households has improved their net wealth and strengthened their balance sheets, supporting spending and credit performance. Excess savings among higher-income households have contributed to their high levels of spending as social distancing measures eased. The authors decompose excess savings across income quartiles using data on personal income, fiscal support, and outlays. They find that fiscal transfers and reduced spending were the primary drivers of excess savings for lower-income households, while foregone consumption was the main factor for higher-income households. The article acknowledges the uncertainty in the estimates and compares them to other data sets, such as the JPMorganChase Institute's checking account balance data and the Distributional Financial Accounts. While excess savings may have provided a buffer for lower-income households, they are expected to diminish as fiscal support ends and spending returns to pre-pandemic trends. The impact of excess savings on the economy is complex, as it may have contributed to both increased household resilience and persistently high inflation. While this article focuses on excess savings and their economic implications, other factors are also crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. These include vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, public health measures, and the capacity of healthcare systems. Additionally, the relationship between excess savings and COVID-19 hospitalizations may be indirect, as economic conditions can influence mobility, behavior, and access to healthcare, which in turn affect hospitalization rates.

Title: Covid-19 Vaccinations: County and State Tracker
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article provides an overview of COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States as of December 2021, with a focus on how these rates vary across different states, age groups, and vulnerable counties. Here are the key points: As of December 9, 2021, about 265.6 million people in the U.S. had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with about 226.6 million people fully vaccinated. About 111.4 million fully vaccinated people have received an additional or booster dose, and approximately 19.4 million have received the updated bivalent booster, offering the highest protection against the virus. Vaccination and booster coverage vary significantly by age, with older adults having higher coverage due to earlier eligibility. The speed of vaccination varies across states, with some reaching a larger share of their population than others. More than a year into the vaccine rollout, socially vulnerable counties have lower vaccination rates than the least vulnerable counties, with a majority of the most disadvantaged counties located in the South. Everyone aged 6 months and older is now eligible for vaccination, including the Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. However, due to concerns about rare blood clotting, regulators suggest opting for mRNA vaccines instead of Johnson & Johnson. The vaccine rollout began in December 2020, initially focusing on vulnerable populations such as healthcare workers and seniors. The article also mentions that there are various reasons why eligible individuals may not be vaccinated or boosted, with surveys indicating differing attitudes and demographics between those who refuse and those who are open to vaccination but have not yet received a shot.

Title: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training: A regional analysis and international perspective
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This fact sheet examines youth transitions between education and the labor market in Canada and selected OECD countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NEET rate, which refers to individuals not in employment, education, or training, is used as an indicator to identify youth at risk of social disconnection. During the first year of the pandemic, Canada and the United States experienced larger increases in NEET rates among youth aged 18-24 compared to other OECD countries. Canada's stricter health measures in 2021, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, impacted economic and education opportunities for youth, with higher stringency scores indicating more severe restrictions. By 2021, NEET rates returned to pre-pandemic levels across all selected OECD countries due to government interventions, easing of restrictions, and economic recovery. However, variations existed within Canada, with the Atlantic "bubble" experiencing less economic impact and stable NEET rates, while Quebec and Ontario had higher stringency scores and unfavorable labor market conditions, resulting in increased NEET rates for youth aged 25-29. The prairie provinces saw the greatest sustained increase in NEET rates for youth aged 20-24, with Alberta and Saskatchewan experiencing economic downturns and disruptions. Youth aged 15-19 in Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia were most impacted by school closures, with NEET rates increasing significantly in 2020 but returning to education by 2021. Indigenous youth residing off-reserve maintained similar NEET rates during the pandemic, while non-Indigenous youth saw a significant increase. Additional impacts of public health measures included safety concerns and adverse effects on mental health, particularly for women with lower education levels and immigrants. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted youth transitions between education and employment, with varying impacts across different regions and age groups in Canada. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction. However, it is important to note that the social and economic disruptions caused by public health measures may have indirect effects on healthcare utilization, including hospitalizations.

Title: Western-led study explores COVID-19 effects on cognition
Publisher: Western News
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, reveals that people who had COVID-19 may experience short and long-term cognitive impairments, including issues with reasoning, verbal abilities, and speed of thought. The severity of these impairments is directly related to the severity of the original infection, with more severe COVID-19 symptoms resulting in worse cognitive issues. The study also found that these cognitive impairments did not improve over time, suggesting they could be long-lasting. The participants in the study also exhibited elevated levels of depression and anxiety, with 30% meeting the clinical criteria for either or both conditions. These mental health impacts were not linked to the severity of the original infection or cognitive impairments, indicating that they may be a result of the pandemic's overall impact. This research is crucial for understanding the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 and highlights the importance of monitoring and supporting individuals who have contracted the virus, even those with mild infections, as they may experience significant cognitive impairments. The study also underscores the need to address the mental health consequences of the pandemic, which appear to be widespread.

Title: Life expectancy changes since COVID-19
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article analyzes changes in life expectancy (LE) across 29 countries since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. It finds that while some countries, such as Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden, have seen significant LE bounce backs from 2020 losses, 12 countries, including Bulgaria, Chile, and the United States, have experienced further significant LE declines in 2021. The pandemic has also disrupted recent trends of a decreasing gap in LE between females and males, with the female advantage in LE increasing in 16 of the 29 countries during the pandemic. Officially registered COVID-19 deaths are found to explain most of the LE deficit in 2021 across Europe, the United States, and Chile, with the exception of the Netherlands, where other causes accounted for more than half of the deficit. The analysis also reveals that increased mortality among those aged 60 and above remained the most important contributor to LE losses compared to pre-pandemic levels. Higher vaccination uptake by October 2021 was associated with smaller LE deficits in the fourth quarter of 2021 across countries, particularly for those aged 60 and above. However, there were outliers, such as the United States, which had a higher LE deficit than countries with similar vaccination rates. To put the COVID-19 pandemic into context, the article also examines historical mortality crises over the past 120 years. It finds that while there have been significant mortality shocks during World War I, the Spanish flu epidemic, and World War II, the frequency of such crises has decreased in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in larger annual declines in LE compared to recent flu epidemics, and the bounce backs to pre-pandemic LE levels have been slower in some countries. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LE across multiple countries, highlighting the varying trends and contributing factors. The findings have important implications for understanding the pandemic's long-term effects on population health and can inform public health policies and preparedness for future crises.

Title: Canada's ERs are under intense pressure — and winter is coming
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Hospital emergency departments across Canada are overcrowded and overwhelmed even before the usual flu season begins, with concerns about the upcoming winter months. ERs in Montreal have been operating at 150% capacity, and staffing shortages due to COVID-19 have exacerbated the situation. The problem is widespread, affecting provinces like Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. Wait times in Ontario's ERs have increased significantly, and rural hospitals in British Columbia have had to scale back services or close on weekends. The lack of staff, a resurgence of COVID-19 patients, and backlogs in the healthcare system are contributing to the overload. The number of COVID-19 patients in Quebec's hospitals has climbed beyond 2,000, and the province's health minister is encouraging people to get their booster shots. Dr. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada's chief medical adviser, warns of another COVID-19 wave in Europe and the potential for a worse flu season. The complexity and age of patients are also factors in the overcrowding, as they require more specialized care. Authorities are urging residents to get their influenza and COVID-19 booster shots to reduce the strain on the healthcare system. Creative solutions, such as utilizing hotels or apartment buildings for patient care, may be necessary to address the crisis.

Title: ‘Regretfully, but necessarily’: Seneca College president says COVID-19 vaccination policy will end Dec. 31
Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Seneca College in Ontario, Canada, will rescind its COVID-19 vaccination policy as of December 31, 2022. The policy, which required students, staff, contractors, and visitors to be vaccinated to enter campus buildings, was initially implemented in July 2021, making Seneca the first college or university in Ontario to adopt such a mandate. The decision to end the policy comes after the Ontario Superior Court upheld the mandate last month in response to an injunction sought by two unvaccinated students. Seneca's president, David Agnew, attributed the change to increasingly lenient federal and provincial vaccination policies, making it challenging for the college to independently verify vaccination status. He emphasized that the college had put the health and safety of its community first during the pandemic and that the current masking requirements would remain in place until the end of the year, with mandated masking in classrooms, labs, and certain other settings continuing indefinitely. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, it's important to note that the rescinding of vaccine mandates by educational institutions may impact hospitalization rates, especially if it leads to increased transmission among students and staff. However, the overall impact on hospitalizations will depend on various factors, including community vaccination rates, the prevalence of underlying health conditions, and the emergence of new variants.
