Title: New immune-evasive Omicron strains are coming. Is Canada ready?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting: 1. New Omicron subvariants (e.g., XBB, BQ.1.1) are emerging, which can evade immunity better than previous strains. 2. COVID-related hospitalizations are currently higher than any previous fall in the pandemic, nearly double last October and almost four times more than in 2020. 3. Booster uptake remains stagnant, with only 18% of the population opting for a shot in the past six months. 4. Experts are concerned that the lack of booster uptake and the emergence of new subvariants could lead to increased hospitalizations and pressure on the healthcare system. 5. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore may recommend the return of mask mandates if the province's healthcare system becomes too strained. 6. Vaccines are still considered the best line of defense against future surges, and experts recommend getting a booster dose now, especially for those at higher risk of serious illness. These points suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may increase in the coming months due to the emergence of new subvariants and low booster uptake, making it essential to monitor the situation closely and consider additional public health measures.

Title: Ontario reports 109 new COVID-19 deaths up from 67 as wastewater signals rise

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 109 new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Ontario over the past seven days, the highest weekly death count since early May. Hospitalizations increased to 1,663, up from 1,629 the previous week. Intensive care admissions rose to 158, up from 143 the previous week, with 65 patients requiring a ventilator to breathe. Test positivity rate dropped slightly to 16.4% from 17.1% the previous week, but remains higher than the 13.3% reported two weeks ago. Wastewater signal suggests the prevalence of the virus is on the rise, with extrapolations predicting a marked rise in coming weeks. These values indicate an increasing trend in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in Ontario, which is relevant for forecasting future hospitalizations. The wastewater signal and test positivity rate also suggest that the virus is still prevalent and spreading, which could lead to further increases in hospitalizations.

Title: Health Canada approves drug to treat COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, AstraZeneca says
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Health Canada has expanded the authorization of the injectable treatment Evusheld for immunocompromised individuals aged 12 and older who are unlikely to have a sufficient immune response to COVID-19 vaccination alone. The treatment contains two lab-made antibodies that can linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection. A clinical trial showed a 5% benefit from the drug compared to a placebo among high-risk individuals. Experts warn that the long-term safety of the treatment is unknown and that variants could make the drug less effective. The treatment is seen as a way to reduce "preventable hospitalizations" among high-risk individuals, especially in the context of rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Ontario. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The expansion of treatment options for immunocompromised individuals, which could lead to a reduction in hospitalizations among this group. The potential impact of variants on the effectiveness of the treatment, which could affect hospitalization rates. The rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Ontario, which could indicate a new wave of the pandemic and increased pressure on the healthcare system.

Title: Trudeau urges Canadians to get their COVID, flu shots to avoid other health measures
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Recent upward trends in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are causing concerns among health officials. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore may recommend the return of mask mandates if the province's health care system becomes too strained. COVID-19 vaccinations have stalled, with around 80% of the population having received the primary series and 49% having received one additional booster. A new Omicron-targeted vaccine dose is available, and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that everyone aged 12 and older receive a fall COVID-19 booster dose. Low flu circulation over the last two years puts children at a greater risk of catching the illness, which could further strain the healthcare system. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 80% (percentage of population that has received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine) 49% (percentage of Canadians who have received the primary series and one additional booster) 12 (age group eligible for Omicron-targeted vaccine doses) Increasing trend (recent upward trend in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations)

Title: Characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in a reference hospital in Spain
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study highlights the impact of vaccination on reducing the severity of COVID-19, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among the elderly. Key findings include: A marked decrease in disease severity, ICU admissions, and deaths among hospitalized patients during the fifth wave of the pandemic in Spain, coinciding with high vaccination rates, especially among the elderly. The importance of vaccination in reducing the risk of COVID-19 resurgence and adverse outcomes, as predicted by mathematical models and supported by data from various countries. The effectiveness of vaccines in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admissions, and mortality, particularly among nursing home residents and healthcare workers. The need to consider factors influencing vaccine effectiveness, such as immune response, previous immune status, and time elapsed since vaccination, especially among the elderly. These findings can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly in the context of vaccination efforts and the spread of new variants.

Title: The COVID emergency may be over — but when will the pandemic end?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and B.C., putting added pressure on the health-care system. New Omicron subvariants derived from previous strains like BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 are showing high levels of immune evasion, which could drive future waves of transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) is meeting to determine if COVID-19 should still be considered a global emergency, but experts warn that the pandemic is not over and that the virus will continue to mutate and spread. Vaccination plays a critical role in preventing severe illness and death, but there are still large gaps in vaccination coverage, particularly in certain parts of the world. Experts predict that COVID-19 will become endemic in many parts of the world, but that it will continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among older adults and those with underlying health conditions. The development of new vaccines, including nasal vaccines, could be a game-changer in reducing infection and transmission, but these are still in development. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Rising hospitalizations in Ontario and other provinces Emergence of new Omicron subvariants with high levels of immune evasion Continued mutation and spread of the virus Gaps in vaccination coverage Predictions of COVID-19 becoming endemic in many parts of the world Development of new vaccines, including nasal vaccines.
