Title: New immune-evasive Omicron strains are coming. Is Canada ready?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the concerns around COVID-19 and flu season in Canada, with a focus on the low uptake of booster shots and the potential for severe illness. Key points include:
Despite having access to updated bivalent vaccines that target Omicron and its variants, only 18% of Canadians have opted for a shot in the past six months.
This lack of boosters has led some experts to warn that Canada is "sleepwalking on a tightrope" and could face an overwhelmed health-care system if a severe variant takes hold.
The article quotes Dr. David Naylor, co-chair of the federal government's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, saying that the failure to impose selective mask mandates would be a major dereliction of public health and political leadership.
Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, has said he would recommend the return of mask mandates if the province's health-care system becomes too strained.
Despite the concerns, vaccines are still considered the best line of defense against future surges, and most Canadian adults should get a booster shot now, according to experts like Dr. Bonnie Henry and Dr. Allison McGeer.
Overall, the article highlights the importance of getting vaccinated and taking precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and flu in Canada, especially as we head into the fall and winter months when hospitalizations are likely to increase.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. 
Total hospitalizations: 1,663 (up from 1,629 the week before)
Hospitalization trend: increasing
ICU admissions: 158 (up from 143 the week prior)
Ventilator requirement: 65 patients require a ventilator to breathe.

Title: Health Canada approves drug to treat COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, AstraZeneca says
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False

Relevant.
Some people in Ontario who are immunocompromised may use Evusheld to prevent COVID-19 infection. The effectiveness of Evusheld varies, with a 5% benefit compared to placebo. Variants could make Evusheld less effective. Dr. Chagla suggests using Evusheld as one way to reduce "preventable hospitalizations" by making high-risk individuals aware of treatment options and how to access them.

Title: Trudeau urges Canadians to get their COVID, flu shots to avoid other health measures
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
80% of Canadians have received the primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine.
There are concerns over recent upward trends in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Ontario.
The Chief Medical Officer of Health has warned that he will recommend mask mandates if the province's healthcare system becomes too strained, possibly indicating potential for increased hospitalizations.

Title: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on community respiratory virus activity
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The text discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. The main points can be summarized as follows:
1. Rhinoviruses and Respiratory Enteroviruses: These viruses persisted during the pandemic, despite stringent social distancing measures. Their non-enveloped structure made them resistant to environmental factors, leading to prolonged shedding.
2. Seasonality: As NPIs were relaxed, typical seasonal-level changes in rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus activity resumed in some regions, such as South Korea and Australia.
3. Infection Dynamics: The sensitivity of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus to changes in NPI implementation led some researchers to propose using these viruses as a sentinel indicator of the effectiveness of NPIs.
4. Inverse Relationship with SARS-CoV-2: Studies found an inverse relationship between the levels of SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus in some locations, suggesting possible viral interference or competition for host resources.
5. Other Non-SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Viruses:
Influenza Virus and RSV: Experienced marked reductions in circulation at the onset of the pandemic but rebounded as NPIs were lifted.
Human Coronavirus, Parainfluenza Virus, and Metapneumovirus: Also showed reduced circulation at the onset of the pandemic but rebounded later due to school reopening and relaxation of NPIs.
Adenoviruses and Respiratory Enteroviruses: Persisted despite NPIs, with fewer fluctuations in case counts compared to influenza virus and RSV.
Human Bocavirus: Showed different circulation patterns, including initial decreases followed by a later resurgence.
Human Parechovirus: Had limited data on circulation patterns during the pandemic.
Overall, the text highlights the complex interplay between non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses and NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in a reference hospital in Spain
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Low hospitalization rates during the fifth wave of the pandemic were observed in patients with mild symptoms and no comorbidities.
Most patients who came to the emergency room were young and had not been vaccinated with full regimens, indicating a potential risk for future hospitalizations.
The effectiveness of vaccines against Delta variant was lower compared to Alpha variant after partial vaccination.
The article highlights the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates, particularly among young people, to achieve group immunity.
