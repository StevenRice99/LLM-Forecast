The article highlights values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
5,000 current hospitalizations (expected to rise)
No significant drop in hospital admissions since the original Omicron wave
Emergence of new variants, such as XBB.1.5, with possible rapid spread in Canada

A relevant article for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
The XBB.1.5. COVID-19 subvariant is already present in Canada and highly infectious. As of Dec. 10, 2022, it had not been identified in Ontario, but was rising rapidly south of the border. The World Health Organization is tracking its severity, with unknown effects on hospitalizations and vaccine efficacy. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include:
Presence of XBB.1.5. in neighboring regions (e.g., Michigan)
Vaccination rates in Ontario (19.9% four-dose coverage in Windsor-Essex)
Rate of cases and hospitalizations due to XBB.1.5. in other provinces (B.C.: 12 cases, NL: 1 case)

Title: What is the ‘Kraken' Variant? What We Know About the New COVID Variant So Far
Publisher: NBC Chicago
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
According to the article, here are the key points:
New COVID-19 variant (XBB.1.5) 
It's a highly immune-evading subvariant of the omicron strain
Has shown increased hospitalization rates in older adults in the Northeast US
Symptoms are similar to previous variants, with fewer severe symptoms and more cold-like symptoms in vaccinated individuals
The bivalent COVID booster appears to offer some protection against severe illness, particularly for those who have received recent boosters
Concerns about treatment options 
Recent strains of COVID-19 have made monoclonal antibodies ineffective against the new variant
This may leave immunocompromised individuals without a reliable treatment option
Monitoring and surveillance 
Experts are closely monitoring the spread of XBB.1.5 in the US, particularly in areas where hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus and flu are falling
While there is some concern about the new variant, it's still considered an "variant of interest" rather than a "variant of concern"
Vaccination and boosters 
The bivalent COVID booster remains effective against severe illness from XBB.1.5, particularly for those who have received recent boosters
However, protection is much lower for individuals without recent infections or boosters
Overall, while there are some concerns about the new variant, experts believe it's still manageable with current vaccination strategies and public health measures.

Adverse event reports: Regular reports on adverse events following immunization are published by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
Misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines: Claims about recent physician deaths, including those made by Chris Shoemaker and William Makis, have been debunked as conspiracy theories.

Title: More money is a must, but health-care delivery also needs a major rethink, doctors say
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses Canada's health-care system and the challenges it faces in delivering quality care to its citizens. The main points can be summarized as follows:
Funding: The federal government currently contributes around 22% of health-care funding, with provinces covering the rest. Some experts argue that this proportion should increase, potentially up to 38.5%, to fund essential services like mental health, home care, and long-term care.
Reform: Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos has stated that Ottawa will not boost health transfers without system reforms aimed at improving outcomes. This suggests a willingness to invest in the system but only if provinces agree to changes that enhance delivery.
Administrative burden: Doctors and administrators highlight the need for long-term, predictable funding to reduce administrative burdens on medical staff. They argue that temporary contracts and short-term solutions are no longer viable due to increased administrative requirements.
Streamlining health information: Experts advocate for faster integration of digital health records to alleviate some of the administrative load on healthcare professionals.
Addressing staffing shortages: Recognizing foreign credentials of doctors and nurses already in Canada could rapidly boost their numbers without relying on international recruitment. This would involve a three-month practice-ready assessment, which could add hundreds of doctors to the system by spring.
Changing delivery models: To alleviate hospital strain, doctors propose increasing non-hospital health services, reducing administrative burdens for family physicians, and integrating allied healthcare professionals into teams.
Overall, solving Canada's health-care crisis demands a multifaceted approach that includes increased funding, reforms aimed at improving outcomes, streamlining health information, addressing staffing shortages, and changing delivery models.
