Title: Alberta hit by far more COVID deaths this year than in the same period in previous years

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the following key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: Alberta's COVID-19 death toll in 2022 is higher than in previous years, with 1,247 deaths between January 1 and June 6, 2022. The Omicron variant, particularly the BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants, has hit Alberta hard, leading to a higher death toll than the Delta wave in 2021. Low uptake of third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Alberta, with only 38% of the population having received a third shot, is contributing to the high death toll. Death rates are higher in nearly all age groups among unvaccinated people and those who have had only two immunizations compared to those who have had three doses. Doctors are urging Albertans to get vaccinated, particularly those with significant comorbidities or over 50, and to seek treatment immediately if they have symptoms. These points suggest that: The Omicron variant is still a significant threat, particularly for those who are not fully vaccinated. Low vaccination rates, particularly for third doses, can contribute to higher death tolls. Age and comorbidities are significant risk factors for severe illness and death from COVID-19. These insights can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, highlighting the importance of vaccination rates, age, and comorbidities in predicting hospitalization rates.

Title: Ontario to end most mask mandates Saturday, including in hospitals, on public transit
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article reports on the lifting of mask mandates in Ontario, including in hospitals and on public transit, which could potentially impact COVID-19 hospitalizations. The article also mentions that some experts, such as Dr. Susy Hota and Dr. Colin Furness, believe that mask mandates should continue in high-risk settings, including hospitals, due to the presence of vulnerable and elderly individuals. Key values mentioned in the article that are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: 522 COVID-19 hospitalizations reported on Wednesday, down slightly from 526 on Tuesday and 722 on the same day last week. 41% of hospitalized individuals were admitted specifically for COVID-19, while the rest were admitted for other reasons and then tested positive. 114 individuals required intensive care, with 54 patients requiring the help of ventilators to breathe. 69% of people in intensive care units were admitted because of COVID-19, while the rest were admitted for other reasons and then tested positive. A test positivity rate of 6.4% and at least 1,013 new daily cases of COVID-19 reported on Wednesday. These values provide insight into the current state of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario and can be used to inform forecasting models.

Title: Identifying spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 transmissions and the drivers of the patterns in Toronto: a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal modelling
Publisher: Nature.com

Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of COVID-19 cases in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, using a Bayesian hierarchical space-time model. The model incorporated demographic and socioeconomic variables, such as population density, land surface temperature, and percentage of immigrants, to identify areas with high COVID-19 incidence rates. The study found that the percentage of immigrants, higher education rate, and land surface temperature were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases. The study's findings can be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of COVID-19 cases and the factors that contribute to these patterns. Specifically, the study's results suggest that areas with high population density, high percentage of immigrants, and high land surface temperature are more likely to experience high COVID-19 incidence rates. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Percentage of immigrants Higher education rate Land surface temperature Population density These values can be used to inform forecasting models and predict areas that are likely to experience high COVID-19 hospitalization rates.
