During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fraser Health, a health authority in Canada, formed a unique team called the Long-term Care Deployment Team to specifically address outbreaks in long-term care facilities and protect the vulnerable residents who lived there. This team was composed of 200 licensed practical nurses, community health workers, and healthcare assistants, and they provided crucial support to overwhelmed long-term care facilities. Cheryl Beach, the Executive Director of Integrated Community Services, led the assembly of this team, which was a proactive measure to safeguard the health and quality of care for approximately 8,600 long-term care residents in the region. The team's members worked like first responders, bravely entering facilities with COVID-19 outbreaks to care for residents and staff amid stressful and challenging conditions. During the pre-vaccination waves of COVID-19, the team supported up to 40 long-term care facilities simultaneously. With the introduction of vaccines, the occurrences of outbreaks in facilities have slowed, but the team remains active in providing support during outbreaks. Their efforts have drawn recognition and gratitude from health authorities and leadership. The Long-term Care Deployment Team's work is a testament to their commitment and courage in the face of adversity. Their contributions have been acknowledged with a special award, the Above and Beyond Best in Health Care Merit Award, for their exemplary pandemic response. The team continues to play a vital role in managing COVID-19 hospitalizations and outbreaks in long-term care homes.

Title: The Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the updated interim recommendations for the use of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine against COVID-19: The vaccine is safe and effective for individuals aged 18 and above, with priority given to older adults, health workers, and immunocompromised individuals. Pregnant women can be vaccinated if the benefits outweigh the potential risks, but there is limited data on vaccine efficacy and safety in this group. Breastfeeding women can be vaccinated, and breastfeeding doesn't need to be discontinued. The vaccine is not recommended for those under 18 or those with a history of anaphylaxis to any vaccine component. The vaccine is safe, and its efficacy is supported by a large phase 3 trial in Brazil, showing 51% efficacy against symptomatic infection, and 100% against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization. The recommended dosage is 2 doses, with a possible third dose for those 60 and above and immunocompromised individuals. A booster dose may be considered 4-6 months after the primary series, and it can be a different vaccine product. There is currently no data on the vaccine's impact on transmission, but public health measures such as mask-wearing and physical distancing should continue. The vaccine has shown effectiveness against the P.1 variant in Brazil, but data for the Omicron variant is still insufficient. Overall, the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is comparable to other vaccines in preventing severe disease and hospitalization.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted aviation, with airlines grounding fleets and laying off employees due to decreased passenger numbers and revenues. The article examines the recovery of various flying activities in Canada up to the end of 2021. Visual flight rule (VFR) movements, which include general aviation, flight training, and some air taxi operations, recovered faster than instrument flight rule (IFR) movements, which include airline and commuter flights. By December 2021, IFR movements reached 75% of 2019 levels, while VFR movements exceeded 95% in some months of 2021. Helicopter and piston airplane activity was more robust than turbine airplane activity, with turbine-engine airplanes used mostly by larger air carriers. Private aircraft movements, including corporate and general aviation, recovered faster and reached pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2020. The article also discusses the impact of airport closures and restrictions on operations. Overall, smaller flying activities and air carriers recovered faster than larger airlines, which continued to be affected by travel restrictions and low demand.

Title: New study: Montreal researchers identify three drugs that could reduce mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients
Publisher: McGill University
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Researchers from the RI-MUHC and the McGill Genome Centre conducted a study to understand the biological responses of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and identify potential drug treatments. They found that certain cellular pathways were overactivated in patients who succumbed to the disease compared to those who recovered. The researchers performed cellular and genomic analyses on ICU patients with severe COVID-19 and compared the data between deceased patients, survivors, and healthy individuals. They found significant differences in the composition of PBMCs (critical components of the immune system), with a reduction of T cells and an increase in myeloid cells in critically ill patients. Additionally, they detected overactivation of specific molecular pathways associated with epigenetic changes in monocytes, a type of white blood cell, in patients who died. To identify potential drug treatments, the team used transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to look for existing drugs that could suppress the overactivated cellular pathways. They initially found 1,500 candidate drugs, which were narrowed down to 53 used for treating cancers and inflammatory conditions. Finally, they identified three promising candidate drugs: tacrolimus, zotatifin, and nintedanib. These drugs target the specific pathways that were overactivated in the monocytes of patients who died from COVID-19. The study provides preclinical data to support the testing of these drugs in controlled clinical trials, with the hope of reducing mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients. This research helps to understand the physiology of immune cells in severe COVID-19 and identifies potential drug targets for treatment. By analyzing the differences in cellular pathways between patients who recovered and those who died, the researchers were able to identify specific drugs that can be repurposed to treat severe disease. This information can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and improve patient outcomes by providing potential therapeutic options for severe cases.

Title: Identifying spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 transmissions and the drivers of the patterns in Toronto: a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal modelling
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The study area for this research is Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with a focus on the impact of various factors on COVID-19 infection rates in different neighborhoods. The study utilized data from January 2020 to October 2, 2020, and included demographic, socioeconomic, and land surface temperature (LST) information. The study employed Bayesian spatiotemporal models, including space-time separable and inseparable models, to analyze the data. Variable selection was conducted in two steps, addressing collinearity and using a Bayesian variable selection method. Standardization was applied to variables due to their different units. Four Bayesian hierarchical space-time models were implemented using WinBUGS software, and model selection was based on Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) and probability of direction (pD) values. The selected model (Model 3) provided spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal relative risk estimates. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze the temporal patterns in relative risk, identifying significant changes in trends. The spatiotemporal risk trend analysis determined whether the relative risk in each neighborhood increased, decreased, or remained stable over time. A sensitivity analysis was performed by running additional models with different prior assumptions to ensure the robustness of the findings. The study's methodological framework is illustrated in a flow diagram, providing an overview of the process.

Title: How to Compare COVID Deaths for Vaccinated and Unvaccinated People
Publisher: Scientific American
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: While it may seem like a large number of people who have died from COVID-19 were vaccinated, it is crucial to understand the context. The CDC analyzed data from 28 states and found that, on average, 644 people died from COVID-19 each week in March, with 261 of them having received either the primary vaccination series or a booster shot. However, considering the total population sizes of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is essential to avoid the base rate fallacy. To better understand the impact of vaccination, it is useful to look at incidence rates, which standardize the denominator across groups. This provides a more accurate comparison. The CDC's Heather Scobie emphasizes the significance of boosters, stating that unvaccinated individuals aged 12 and older had 17 times higher death rates than those who received a primary series and a booster. The risk of death was eight times higher for the unvaccinated compared to those with just the primary series. Additionally, age is a critical factor, as older individuals are more likely to be vaccinated, boosted, and succumb to COVID-19 due to a weaker immune system. Therefore, analyzing data within specific age groups further highlights the reduced risk of death associated with vaccination. The waning of immune protection over time and the varying immune responses to the primary series among older adults underscore the importance of booster shots in providing additional protection. It's worth noting that as more unvaccinated individuals die from COVID-19, the unvaccinated population decreases, resulting in a relatively larger vaccinated group. This can lead to an increase in total deaths despite a lower death rate among the vaccinated. Nevertheless, vaccination significantly reduces the risk of death from COVID-19, even if no vaccine is 100% effective.

Title: Babies of COVID-19: The impact of being born during the pandemic - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on new mothers and their babies in Canada. Here are the key points: New mom Angela Bachmann shared her experience of giving birth during the pandemic, expressing concern about COVID-19 restrictions and the risk of catching the virus while pregnant. Pediatricians note that the pandemic's social isolation and anxiety have impacted early child development, with studies showing delayed motor and language skills in infants born during this time. Dr. Fatima Kakkar, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, recommends developmental assessments for children born during COVID-19 to identify any potential "red flags" and provide early intervention if needed. COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in newborns and infants being less exposed to routine childhood illnesses, which may increase their susceptibility to viral infections in the future. While children have been least affected by COVID-19, pregnant women are at increased risk of severe illness, and getting COVID-19 during pregnancy can lead to complications. Vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy can provide protection for both the mother and newborn, with studies showing reduced risk of infection in infants born to vaccinated mothers. Lockdowns and isolation have also impacted social support for new parents, particularly first-time parents, who have missed out on extended family and peer support during a crucial time. Experts believe that babies will adapt post-pandemic and that any delays or issues identified now can be addressed through early intervention. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models. However, it is mentioned that hospitalizations in young children, especially those without other severe chronic medical conditions, remain very rare. Additionally, vaccination during pregnancy can provide some protection for newborns, which may help reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.
