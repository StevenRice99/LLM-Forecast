Title: First COVID-19 vaccine could be delivered to distribution points as early as end of December, Fortin says
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article provides an overview of the Canadian government's plan for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine and addresses some of the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the rollout. Here are the key points: Federal officials have announced that the first doses of the vaccine are expected to be administered in January, with three million Canadians receiving shots in the first three months of 2021. One of the main challenges is distributing vaccines that must be stored at very low temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine, for example, needs to be kept at -80 degrees Celsius, while the Moderna vaccine must be stored at -20 degrees Celsius. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, a former NATO commander, is leading the vaccination logistics and said that the military and its partners will be ready to deploy vaccines as soon as they are approved. There will be 14 distribution points across Canada ready to receive the Pfizer vaccine starting on December 14, with two sites each in Alberta, B.C., Ontario, and Quebec, and one in each of the other provinces. The plan for the territories is still being finalized. The shots will likely be distributed on a per capita basis, though some observers argue that provinces with higher caseloads should receive priority. There will eventually be 205 locations across the country where healthcare professionals can administer the vaccine, with the provinces and territories deciding on the specific locations and timing. At least one "dry run" has been executed to ensure smooth distribution once the vaccine arrives from manufacturing hubs in the U.S. and abroad, and more practice runs are planned. Dr. Supriya Sharma, Chief Medical Advisor at Health Canada, said the regulatory review of Pfizer's vaccine is progressing well and final approval could come within the next 7 to 10 days. Canada has placed orders for 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with options for more in the following months. The company has reported a 95% effectiveness rate in preventing COVID-19 among clinical trial participants without prior infection. The Moderna vaccine, which is expected to secure approval after Pfizer's, will be imported by the federal government and then divided up for the provinces and territories. Logistics firms are being contracted for transportation to vaccination centers. Two other vaccines, from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen division, have also been submitted for regulatory approval but still require additional information. The federal government is refining its guidance on who should receive early doses, with early priorities likely to include seniors in long-term care homes and frontline healthcare workers. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has criticized the government for not providing a concrete timeline and details of the distribution plan, arguing that this lack of clarity hinders businesses and provinces in their planning. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of Canada's vaccine distribution strategy, highlighting the key players, timelines, and challenges involved. The approval and distribution of vaccines are expected to have a significant impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations in the coming months, with priority groups receiving protection first.

Title: What makes certain groups more vulnerable to COVID-19?
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from McGill University have published a study in the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal that sheds light on why COVID-19 severely affects the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. The study focused on analyzing protein sequences of the virus and host cell receptors across different species. The researchers found that the virus's protein spikes attach to a protein receptor on the host cell's surface, called ACE2, allowing the virus to enter and hijack the cell's machinery to replicate and spread. They discovered that animals susceptible to the virus, such as humans, cats, and dogs, have two specific cysteine amino acids that form a disulfide bond, creating an anchor for the virus to attach to. On the other hand, animals resistant to the virus, like pigs and cows, lack one of these cysteine amino acids, preventing the formation of the disulfide bond and inhibiting viral anchoring. The key findings of the study suggest that increased cellular oxidation in the elderly and those with underlying health issues may make them more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection. Preventing the formation of the viral anchor through antioxidants could potentially reduce the severity of the disease by disrupting the virus's entry into host cells. The research team, led by Professor Jaswinder Singh, included professors from McGill University, the University of Calgary, and the University of Saskatchewan. They plan to further investigate their findings using CRISPR technology and by studying other proteins near the ACE2 receptor.

Title: CSIS accuses Russia, China and Iran of spreading COVID-19 disinformation - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A report by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has accused Russia, China, and Iran of spreading COVID-19 disinformation to promote their strategic interests. The report, titled "COVID-19: Global Effects and Canadian National Security Interests," suggests that Russia is actively spreading disinformation blaming the West for the virus to discredit Western countries, promote Russian influence, and call for an end to sanctions. Meanwhile, China is focused on a propaganda campaign that highlights its pandemic aid abroad while downplaying its internal restrictions and releasing unreliable infection and mortality data. Iran is also blamed for a disinformation campaign that shifts blame for its handling of the pandemic to foreign actors and sanctions. The article notes that COVID-19 misinformation has flourished since the pandemic began, fueling conspiracy theories and falsehoods. Declassified documents obtained by Global News reveal that CSIS has been monitoring the national security implications of this phenomenon. CSIS spokesman John Townsend stated that disinformation can have serious consequences for Canadians and democratic institutions. The Chinese embassy denied spreading COVID-19 disinformation, while the Russian embassy requested a link to the CSIS statement before commenting. Iran has not had an embassy in Canada since 2012. Professor Stephanie Carvin noted that Moscow and Beijing engage in COVID-19 disinformation for different purposes. Russia aims to sow discord within Western democracies, while China is more concerned with its international reputation and shifting blame away from its lack of transparency. CSIS documents also reveal that the agency's Intelligence Assessment Branch and the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre have been preparing regular internal briefings on COVID-19-related issues, including extremist movements, 5G conspiracy theories, and disinformation campaigns by authoritarian adversaries. These briefings have been prepared for senior officials in various government departments and committees. The article concludes by mentioning a separate CSIS intelligence assessment, which suggests that the pandemic has deepened fissures between authoritarian states and Western liberal democracies, with adversarial states using the pandemic to promote themselves as legitimate alternatives.

Title: Coronavirus and COVID-19: Younger Adults Are at Risk, Too
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article "Coronavirus and COVID-19: Younger Adults Are at Risk, Too" emphasizes that young adults are also susceptible to COVID-19 and can experience severe symptoms and health consequences. While initially, it was believed that older adults were primarily at risk, the CDC reported that individuals under 30 accounted for over 20% of COVID-19 cases during the summer and continue to be significant transmitters. Young adults with underlying health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, or hypertension, are at an even higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. The article highlights important facts to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Young adults aged 18-34 who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 have significant rates of intensive care admission (21%), mechanical ventilation (10%), and mortality (2.7%). Young Black and Hispanic individuals face higher risks due to longstanding racial health inequities and social determinants of health. Jobs in high-risk areas, such as healthcare, food services, transportation, bars, and retail, increase exposure for young adults. College campuses can be hotspots for outbreaks, contributing to community spread when students return home. Young adults may have a false sense of security due to their lower risk compared to older adults, leading to riskier behaviors. Data suggests that increased cases among young adults are followed by a lagged increase in cases among older adults, indicating intergenerational transmission. To mitigate the impact on hospitalizations, the article emphasizes the importance of COVID-19 precautions, including mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and self-monitoring for symptoms, especially for those with vulnerable individuals in their households or communities.

Title: Diamond market now recovering from Covid-19, experts say
Publisher: Cabin Radio
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the natural diamond market, with the supply chain coming to a halt in March. However, the market is showing signs of recovery, with manufacturing capacity in India, a major hub for diamond cutting and polishing, reaching 90% of its pre-pandemic level. While mining companies have reduced their production outlook, consumer demand for diamonds, particularly in China, is driving a recovery in the market. The NWT's diamond mines have been affected by the pandemic, with one mine shutting down and workers sent home from the other two mines. The economic contribution of diamond mining to the territory is expected to decrease in 2020. Overall, the pandemic has disrupted the natural diamond market, but the industry is showing resilience and adapting to the changing conditions. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the impact of the pandemic on the diamond industry and the NWT's economy is a relevant factor to consider. The closure of mines and the decrease in exploration activities have affected the region's economic growth and employment. However, the recovery in consumer demand for diamonds and the resumption of manufacturing activities in India are positive signs for the market. It is important to monitor the situation and the industry's response to the pandemic to assess its potential impact on healthcare resources and hospitalizations in the affected communities.

Here is a summary of the article: UBC medical student Sukhmeet Sachal has launched an initiative to bring COVID-19 safety measures to Sikh temples in British Columbia, Canada. The project, called the Sikh Health Foundation Initiative, aims to educate the Sikh community about simple ways to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. Sachal recognized the importance of Gurdwara, a Sikh temple, for the well-being of the community and wanted to ensure that people could continue to gather safely during the pandemic. He and a network of over 100 volunteers have distributed masks that tie behind the head, accommodating those who wear turbans, and educated visitors about proper mask-wearing and handwashing techniques. The project has received support from the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara community, as well as funding from the Clinton Global Initiative and the Government of Canada. Sachal also collaborated with Fraser Health's South Asian Health Institute (SAHI), which provided guidance on volunteer recruitment, training, and documentation of the project's successes. As the second wave of COVID-19 continues to impact British Columbia, Sachal's initiative is expanding to other Gurdwaras in the region with the support of Fraser Health. The project has already inspired other young leaders in Canada and globally to take similar actions in their communities. Sachal emphasizes the importance of reaching the elderly and the broader South Asian population with COVID-19 safety messages and is encouraged by the positive changes he has observed. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of safety measures and education initiatives like Sachal's. By promoting proper mask-wearing, physical distancing, and handwashing techniques within the Sikh community, the project contributes to the overall effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Effective safety measures can help reduce the number of hospitalizations by lowering the infection rate and severity of COVID-19 cases.

Title: Federal deficit on track to exceed $381B, as spending increases in wake of second COVID-19 wave
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the Canadian government to unveil a new round of financial support, with the national deficit projected to reach a record high of at least $381.6 billion for the fiscal year. This deficit has been caused by ongoing pandemic support, new programs to aid struggling businesses, and early allocations for economic recovery. The Liberals are also planning to increase transfer payments to the provinces. The federal deficit could reach $388.8 billion or even $398.7 billion if the pandemic situation worsens and restrictions are extended or escalated. Since March, the government has spent over $322 billion on direct aid measures to fight COVID-19 and protect Canadians. This includes support for federal, provincial, and territorial measures, a reworked Employment Insurance program, and new leave programs for those affected by COVID-19. The government is also planning to spend more on testing, vaccines, self-isolation support, and personal protective equipment, as well as improve ventilation in public buildings. To stimulate the economy, the government plans to increase the maximum rate of the Emergency Wage Subsidy to 75% and extend the current rate of support for rent subsidies and lockdown top-ups for businesses. A new credit availability program will provide government-backed loans of up to $1 million for up to ten years to hard-hit industries. The government will also establish a $1 billion fund to improve long-term care for seniors and address issues such as homelessness and racism. The federal debt is projected to exceed $1.4 trillion by March 2021, and the unemployment rate is currently at 8.9%. The government expects unemployment to return to pre-pandemic levels by summer 2022. Despite the deficit, Canada's debt-servicing costs relative to the size of its economy are at a 100-year low. The government has introduced "fiscal guardrails" to guide its financial approach and make decisions based on economic indicators.
