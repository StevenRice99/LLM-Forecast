Title: Provinces with least-strict COVID-19 restrictions this summer saw sharp case spikes in second wave, data show

The article discusses the effectiveness of COVID-19 infection control measures in various Canadian provinces and territories, based on data from the Oxford Government Response Tracker. The tracker assigns a stringency score to each jurisdiction based on its policies, such as mask mandates, travel restrictions, and business closures.
According to the data, some provinces with strict measures, such as Quebec and Ontario, have seen success in controlling the spread of COVID-19. In contrast, Manitoba had high rates of infection despite being one of the most restrictive provinces, highlighting the importance of enforcement and compliance with rules.
The article also notes that the relationship between restrictions and infection rates is less clear-cut than in the United States, where some states with low stringency scores have seen high rates of infection. The Oxford researchers emphasize that their data should be used as a tool to inform policy decisions, rather than being taken at face value.
Key points from the article include:
Nunavut has had the worst experience among Canadian territories, with 7 new cases in the past two weeks.
Manitoba's high stringency scores did not translate into effective control of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of enforcement and compliance.
The Oxford data suggests that acting quickly with strict measures can slow the spread of the virus.
Human behavior is a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of infection control measures.
The pandemic has disproportionately affected lower-income communities.
Overall, the article emphasizes the complexity of managing a pandemic and the need for nuanced policy decisions based on local context.

Title: Ontario finance minister says he's returning home as news of Caribbean vacation sparks anger
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
It appears that Ontario's Finance Minister, Rod Phillips, traveled outside of Canada for vacation during the holiday season while advising people to stay home due to COVID-19 concerns. The minister's office initially claimed he was in Durham Region on December 15th, but later clarified that the photo accompanying a tweet about funding announcements was taken previously.
The NDP is criticizing Premier Doug Ford for not taking disciplinary action against Phillips, given that other politicians and citizens have faced penalties for violating public health guidelines. The party points out that Ford has shown leniency towards his own allies, such as Niagara MPP Sam Oosterhoff, who was criticized for hosting a large gathering without masks.
Residents of Ontario are expressing disappointment and frustration over the minister's actions, feeling that he is not practicing what he preaches. Some have pointed out that they have been forced to follow public health guidelines, while others have faced financial penalties or time away from work due to travel restrictions.
The Public Health Agency of Canada has also issued a warning against non-essential travel, reminding travelers that contravening the mandatory quarantine can lead to severe penalties.
