The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Ontario reported a record 2,923 new cases of COVID-19, with 64 cases in Ottawa and 16 in Eastern Ontario. The province-wide lockdown, which started 5 days ago, may not be enough to bring down the numbers, and Eastern Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, suggests that the lockdown may need to be extended beyond the initial 28 days. The factors to consider when deciding whether to extend the lockdown include rate of growth, hospitalization rates, and the ability to do contact tracing. Dr. Roumeliotis expects the numbers to continue to rise for at least another couple of weeks due to the Christmas season and the high volume of cases. Ottawa's COVID-19 wastewater levels are increasing, indicating activity in the area, and the city's percent positivity rate has jumped to 2.5% from 2% over the past week.
