Title: A Timeline of COVID-19 Developments in 2020
Publisher: AJMC.com Managed Markets Network
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The year 2020 saw the United States surpass 20 million COVID-19 infections and 346,000 deaths, with global cases reaching 83 million and 1.8 million deaths. Cases surged after Thanksgiving, and health officials are concerned about Christmas and winter holiday travel. Vaccines began rolling out in December, but distribution challenges arose, and the US fell short of its goal to vaccinate 20 million by year-end. The COVID-19 pandemic began in early January, with the World Health Organization (WHO) announcing a mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China. The CDC soon began screening at three US airports receiving flights from Wuhan. The first US case was confirmed in Washington State on January 21, and a Chinese scientist confirmed human-to-human transmission. Wuhan was quickly quarantined, affecting 11 million people, and nearby Huanggang was also locked down, impacting up to 18 million. The WHO declared a global health emergency on January 31 as the death toll exceeded 200 and cases jumped exponentially. In February, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and COVID-19 deaths in China surpassed those of the SARS outbreak. The CDC stated that COVID-19 was nearing pandemic status, and cases were confirmed on a California cruise ship, with passengers later suing the cruise line. In March, the WHO officially declared a pandemic, and President Trump declared a national emergency, unlocking federal funding. A travel ban was imposed on non-US citizens from Europe, and the University of Minnesota began testing hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment. CMS expanded telehealth rules to protect older patients, and the administration proposed direct financial relief for Americans. California issued the first statewide stay-at-home order. By the end of March, clinical trials were stalled due to overwhelmed hospitals, and reports indicated that extended shutdowns could delay a second wave. The Senate passed the CARES Act, providing $2 trillion in aid, and Trump signed it into law. The FDA authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine, but later rescinded it due to heart rhythm concerns. In April, the White House released guidelines for reopening the economy, introducing the concept of "gating criteria." However, a Gallup poll found that 1 in 7 Americans would avoid seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms due to cost concerns, particularly younger and lower-income individuals. An NIH trial showed early promise for remdesivir, and it received an EUA from the FDA. In May, the US death toll surpassed 100,000, and Dr. Anthony Fauci testified that this was likely an underestimate. The US and AstraZeneca formed a vaccine development deal, with doses expected as early as October. In June, US cases reached 2 million, and HHS announced that the vaccine would be free for vulnerable populations. WHO and NIH ended trials of hydroxychloroquine, finding no benefit. A study suggested that 80% of COVID-19 cases in March went undetected, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force addressed rising cases in the South. Gilead set the price for remdesivir at $3120 per treatment course.

Title: Government of the Northwest Territories Begins COVID-19 Vaccinations
Publisher: Government of Northwest Territories
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) has started administering COVID-19 vaccinations to residents, with the first group including those at long-term care facilities, who are considered high-risk. The priority groups for vaccination are people over 60, especially those in long-term care or shared living environments, people with existing chronic diseases or multiple medical conditions, frontline healthcare workers, resident workers who travel in and out of the NWT, and people living in remote communities with limited health infrastructure. The GNWT aims to complete the vaccination rollout by March 2021, with the Moderna vaccine being selected due to its easier storage and distribution in remote communities. The vaccine requires two doses, and public health measures will remain in place until enough people have been vaccinated and the risk of infection decreases.

Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Ottawa, with the first case reported in March 2020. The public health crisis led to closures of schools and non-essential businesses, and the opening of assessment centers. The first death related to COVID-19 was reported nine days after the initial case. To limit the spread, police checkpoints were set up between Ontario and Quebec, and a state of emergency was declared in Ottawa. Long-term care homes, such as Carlingview Manor, were particularly affected, with outbreaks and fatalities. The city surpassed 1,000 cases in April and 2,000 cases in June. Ontario began a phased reopening in May, with Ottawa entering Stage 2 in June. Masks became mandatory in indoor public spaces in July. By September, Ottawa surpassed 3,000 cases, and the medical officer declared the city to be in the second wave. Outbreaks were reported in schools and long-term care homes. The total cases exceeded 4,000 in late September and 5,000 in early October. Indoor gatherings, such as weddings, were linked to a significant number of cases. In response to rising cases, Ontario imposed modified Stage 2 restrictions in October, closing indoor dining and bars. Ottawa moved to the "orange-restrict" zone in November, allowing limited indoor dining and the reopening of gyms and theatres. The medical officer urged residents to avoid travel during the holidays. In mid-December, the first COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Ottawa, and the first person was vaccinated. Despite local opposition, the Ontario government imposed a 28-day lockdown starting December 26. The first case of the COVID-19 variant from the U.K. was confirmed in Ottawa on December 27. To forecast hospitalizations, it is important to monitor key indicators such as the number of new cases, the positivity rate of tests, and the reproduction rate of the virus. Additionally, the availability of hospital resources, such as ICU beds and healthcare staff, will impact the healthcare system's ability to manage an influx of patients.

Here is a summary of the article: A peer-reviewed report on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Phase 3 clinical trial results confirm that the vaccine is effective and safe. The trial, led by principal investigators Lindsey R. Baden, Hana M. El-Sahly, and Brandon Essink, began in July 2020 and enrolled over 30,000 adult volunteers. The average age of volunteers was 51 years, with a diverse demographic representation. The results showed that the vaccine was 94.1% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and also effective in preventing severe cases. There were no significant safety concerns, and no cases of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) were identified. About 50% of participants experienced moderate to severe side effects after the second dose, which resolved within two days. The vaccine was co-developed by Moderna, Inc. and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). On December 18, 2020, the FDA authorized its emergency use for adults in the United States. While the vaccine is highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, more data is needed to determine its impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and asymptomatic infection. The development of the vaccine demonstrates the success of collaboration between academia, government, industry, and the larger community. This summary includes key facts about the vaccine's efficacy and safety profile, which are crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. The high efficacy rate suggests that the vaccine can significantly reduce the number of symptomatic cases, which in turn can help reduce hospitalizations and ease the burden on healthcare systems.

The article shares the stories of three COVID-19 survivors from Ottawa, Canada, highlighting their experiences with the virus and its impact on their lives. Here's a summary: Jenny, a nurse at an acute-care hospital in Ottawa, contracted COVID-19 in early December despite her careful infection control routine. She experienced symptoms such as migraines, fatigue, and aches and pains, and her young son also tested positive. Fortunately, her son showed no symptoms, and she has now recovered and is back at work. Jenny is participating in a research project on COVID-19 and feels that people are less afraid now that more is known about the virus. Ernie Cecchetto, a local businessman, caught COVID-19 while returning from a holiday in Mexico. He experienced lethargy and breathing difficulties, as well as a loss of smell and taste. His symptoms lasted only a few days, but he has experienced lingering psychological effects from the pandemic, including concerns about the unknowns of the virus and its varying symptoms. Cecchetto also worries about the long-term economic impact on small businesses. Brianne Quarrell, a 40-year-old rehabilitation assistant at an Ottawa-area hospital, had a more severe case of COVID-19. With a pre-existing autoimmune condition, she spent a month in the hospital and was intubated and on a respirator. Quarrell's recovery has been slow, and she still doesn't feel fully back to normal. She believes her entire family was positive for the virus at some point during their quarantine. Quarrell finds hope in the vaccination of healthcare workers and the elderly and looks forward to receiving her turn for the vaccine. These stories provide a glimpse into the varied experiences of COVID-19 survivors, from mild symptoms to more severe cases requiring hospitalization. They also highlight the psychological and economic impacts of the pandemic, as well as the hope offered by vaccinations. While the number of cases continues to rise in many regions, the survivors' recovery stories offer a message of hope. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered, including the transmission rate, the severity of cases, and the availability of healthcare resources. The rate of transmission can be influenced by public health measures such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene. The severity of cases can vary depending on individual risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions. Additionally, the availability of healthcare resources, including hospital beds, intensive care units, and ventilators, can impact the ability to manage an influx of patients. By analyzing these factors and using data-driven models, public health officials can make informed predictions about hospitalization rates and implement appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of the virus.

Title: COVID-19 and POTS: Is There a Link?
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article, published on December 28, 2020, features an interview with Dr. Tae Chung, a specialist in neuromuscular disorders and rehabilitation medicine, and the director of the Johns Hopkins POTS Program. Dr. Chung discusses the potential link between COVID-19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition that affects the involuntary nervous system, particularly heart rate and blood pressure. Some individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 continue to experience symptoms such as brain fog, tachycardia, and severe chronic fatigue, which are also symptoms of POTS. This has led doctors to consider POTS as a possible explanation for these extended COVID-19 symptoms. However, the research is still ongoing, and a correct diagnosis is crucial as POTS can be debilitating and requires specific treatment. Dr. Chung explains that there is no standard approach to treating post-COVID patients with POTS-like symptoms. Treatment is personalized and may include aggressive hydration, dietary changes, and medication. Physical therapy is also key to the treatment process, but it may take months for patients to respond to the initial treatment.

Here is a summary of the article, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: This article provides a timeline of milestone moments in Alberta during the COVID-19 pandemic, starting with the first test for the virus on January 20, 2020. It highlights key events, such as the first case, the implementation of health restrictions, school closures, and the declaration of a public health emergency. It also notes the first COVID-19 death in the province on March 19 and the expansion of testing criteria. On April 7, Premier Jason Kenney gave a televised address, warning Albertans about the dangers of the virus. The province released modeling on April 8, predicting at least 400 deaths and up to 800,000 infections by the end of the summer. The relaunch of the province began on May 14, with businesses and health services gradually reopening. However, by July 27, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the Chief Medical Officer of Health, announced that the curve was no longer flat, and cases skyrocketed. Mask mandates were implemented in Edmonton and Calgary on August 1, and schools reopened in September with masking and other safety measures in place. On September 23, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of a more severe fall wave compared to the spring. The province shifted to appointment-only testing in October, and daily case counts surpassed 400 on October 21. In November, Dr. Hinshaw expressed concern about the grim situation in Alberta, with hospitalizations increasing and intensive care units approaching capacity. Leaked recordings of health meetings revealed tension between Dr. Hinshaw and the government's pandemic response team. New health restrictions were announced on December 8, and the first COVID-19 vaccines were administered to healthcare workers in Calgary and Edmonton on December 15, offering a glimmer of hope. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, important facts to consider include the daily case counts, the positivity rate of testing, the effectiveness of public health measures, and the capacity of the healthcare system. The timeline highlights key moments that impacted the spread of the virus and the strain on healthcare resources. The surge in cases in July, the implementation of mask mandates, and the reopening of schools in September are all factors that could influence hospitalization rates. Additionally, the leak of health meeting recordings in November and the resulting tension between Dr. Hinshaw and the government may have impacted the effectiveness of the pandemic response.

Publisher: Nebraska Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article explains that the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain aborted fetal cells, addressing a common misconception. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the role of fetal cell lines in vaccine development and production, clarifying that these cell lines are grown in laboratories based on fetal cells collected decades ago. The article also includes a personal note from Dr. Lawler, a Catholic infectious disease expert, who emphasizes the importance of focusing on saving lives and caring for neighbors, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized. From a scientific perspective, the article distinguishes between fetal tissue and fetal cell lines, explaining that current fetal cell lines are thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue and do not contain any tissue from a fetus. It also specifies the stages of vaccine development and production where fetal cell lines may be used, providing specific examples for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. This information helps to contextualize the use of fetal cell lines in vaccine development and addresses ethical concerns raised by some individuals.
