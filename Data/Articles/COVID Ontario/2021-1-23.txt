The text discusses strategies for expediting administration and improving vaccine acceptance in the Long-Term Care (LTC) sector in Ontario, Canada, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The key points are:
1. Prioritizing LTC residents, workers, and caregivers for vaccination: Both NACI and Ontario’s Ministers’ COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Task Force have prioritized this group.
2. Facilitating efficient vaccine administration: Support should be provided to LTC sector clinicians with educational materials and recommended behavioral change strategies to improve resident, family, staff, and caregiver confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine.
3. Improving vaccine acceptance among LTC staff: Strategies include addressing concerns about vaccine development, identifying peer champions, providing education and ongoing communication, and addressing financial and logistical barriers.
4. Continuing to optimize data collection on LTC homes: Expedited reviews of deaths occurring in LTC homes should be resumed, and timely and complete vaccination rate data should be collected among residents, staff, and caregivers.
5. Promoting timely and complete Resident Assessment Instrument – Minimum Data Set 2.0 (RAI-MDS 2.0) data collection: The RAI-MDS 2.0 is essential for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on LTC resident care needs.
6. Implementing the interRAI LTCF assessment: This next-generation assessment may be more feasible during a pandemic and can provide valuable insights into LTC home staffing, care levels, and infection risks.
The ultimate goal is to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths in LTC homes, both before and after the vaccine era, by implementing these strategies and leveraging existing evidence.
