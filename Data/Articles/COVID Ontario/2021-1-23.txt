The article discusses the ongoing efforts of the University of Toronto (U of T) community to combat and understand COVID-19 and its impact on society. Here are the key points and forecasts regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations: Vaccines are a miracle, but it will take time to deliver them globally, and COVID-19 will not end quickly. Unanswered questions remain about re-vaccination, virus mutations, and uptake rates. The first few months of 2021 will be challenging due to record-high COVID-19 cases, but vaccines are already making a positive difference by prioritizing vulnerable populations. U of T researchers were among the first to investigate and isolate the coronavirus, and their work continues with over 110 federally funded initiatives and significant contributions from the university. The pandemic has disproportionately affected racialized and vulnerable communities in Canada and globally, highlighting the need to address structural inequities. The situation in long-term care homes is deadly and a result of pre-existing issues such as overcrowding. The pandemic has exacerbated these problems, and there is a hope that it will lead to long-term solutions. Isaac Bogoch, an associate professor, and infectious disease specialist predicts that life in Canada will continue to normalize as vaccine programs expand, with a lifting of public health measures and increased travel. Efforts like COVAX aim to provide equitable access to vaccines for lowand middle-income countries, but challenges remain in vulnerable communities, including congregate settings and homeless shelters. The impact on racialized populations in Canada has been disproportionate, and the pandemic has forced society to confront structural inequities that contribute to this disparity. While the vaccine is welcomed, returning to "normal" may not be desirable, given the systemic racism and inequities that have been exposed.
