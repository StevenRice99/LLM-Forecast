Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Ontario has seen 11 consecutive declines in its seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases, a positive sign that community-based control measures are taking effect. However, experts warn that these measures may not be strong enough to sustain a steady downward trend, and that other tools such as rapid testing and contact tracing are needed to support re-opening the economy. Essential workplaces, such as Canada Post, continue to be a key source of transmission, and experts advocate for improvements to paid sick leave benefits, targeted rapid testing, and more isolation centres to reduce household spread. Even with declining cases, hospitalizations and deaths are expected to continue to climb for a period due to lag time from new infections in December. Experts emphasize the need for strict measures, including stay-at-home orders and enforcement, to reverse the course of the pandemic, particularly in provinces like Saskatchewan which is experiencing a steep climb in COVID-19 deaths.
