Title: COVID-19: Canadian zoos prepare to vaccinate animals with experimental vaccine - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Six Canadian zoos are expecting a shipment of 900 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically developed for animals by U.S. pharmaceutical company Zoetis. This vaccine is not yet commercially available but has been approved for experimental use in Canada and the U.S. The vaccine is expected to protect 450 animals, with two doses given three weeks apart. The development of this vaccine began in response to reports of COVID-19 infections in cats and dogs, although a vaccine for pets is not currently needed. COVID-19 has been particularly harmful to large cats such as lions and tigers, with reports of deaths in European zoos. An outbreak at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., left several lions and tigers infected, with three animals severely ill. There have been no reported outbreaks at Canadian zoos so far. The vaccine donation program by Zoetis will continue, with plans to send approximately 15,000 doses to various zoos, conservatories, and sanctuaries worldwide. This vaccine could become a regular part of preventative medicine for big cats in the future.

Title: Marcus Lamb died of covid-19 after his network discouraged vaccines. But some Christian leaders don’t want to talk about it.
Publisher: The Washington Post
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Some Christian leaders and conservative media outlets have been accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and promoting unproven treatments, with televangelist Marcus Lamb, who recently died from COVID-19, being a prominent example. White evangelicals are the religious group most reluctant to get vaccinated, with 25% saying they "definitely won't" get vaccinated. This hesitancy is influenced by a mix of politics, conspiratorial thinking, and skepticism of secular institutions. While some Christian leaders like Franklin Graham have spoken in favor of vaccines, others have remained silent or actively spread misinformation. The issue is explosive for businesses serving vaccine skeptics, and some Christian media executives face backlash when promoting vaccines. Experts attribute the hesitancy among White evangelicals to a combination of factors, including a critical stance towards secular institutions and the influence of political and anti-vaccine movements.

Title: Critical Care Capacity During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Ontario's healthcare system faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) treating patients with COVID-19-related critical illness (CRCI). From March 20, 2020, to October 31, 2021, over 9,000 individuals were admitted to Ontario ICUs with CRCI, with peaks during waves 2 and 3. The pandemic's impact on ICU census was mitigated by reducing non-emergent surgical procedures and increasing ICU capacity through investments in new beds and the use of non-traditional spaces. As of October 31, 2021, the adult critical care bed baseline had increased to 2,343, reflecting a permanent expansion of ICU capacity. The Ontario critical care system adapted through collaboration and coordination between various stakeholders, ensuring that resources were available for the unprecedented number of patients requiring critical care. The system faces ongoing pressure, with the number of ventilated patients remaining higher than the historical average since October 25, 2020. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations is complex and depends on various factors, including vaccination rates, public health measures, and the emergence of new variants. The impact of public health measures on non-COVID conditions and their contribution to reduced hospital and ICU volumes during the pandemic requires further research. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is essential to consider factors such as vaccination rates, the implementation and adherence to public health measures, and the emergence of new variants. Additionally, understanding the impact of public health measures on non-COVID conditions will provide valuable insights into their indirect effects on the healthcare system.

Program planners, decision-makers, and healthcare workers should be aware of the potential long-term health impacts and rehabilitation requirements for COVID-19 patients. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Important factors include the severity of the illness, especially in critical cases, and the potential for long-term health issues and rehabilitation needs, which may vary depending on the patient's initial health status and the severity of COVID-19 infection. Overall, this article highlights the potential for long-term health consequences of COVID-19 and the need to prepare and plan for rehabilitation services to support individuals in their recovery.

Here is a summary of the article: During the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems were overwhelmed, leading to a urgent need for more resources, including staff, to increase ICU capacity. Dr. Debakanta Jena, an orthopedic surgeon at Medicine Hat Regional Hospital, volunteered to assist in the COVID-19 acute care unit, despite it being outside his usual area of expertise. He was motivated by a sense of duty and respect for his colleagues in acute care. Registered Nurse Michele Welford, with 30 years of OR and ambulatory care experience, also joined the COVID-19 unit, describing the experience as heartbreaking due to the severity of patients' illnesses. Dr. Carl Nohr, associate zone medical director in the south zone, expressed gratitude for the support of volunteers like Jena, which helped lower the pressure on the healthcare team. This article highlights the dedication and selflessness of healthcare professionals who stepped up during a challenging time, adapting their skills to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients and support their colleagues.

Here is a summary of the article: Dr. Adina Weinerman, an internist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, has taken on the task of addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among her fellow healthcare workers. While 75% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, there are still those who are reluctant to get the jab, including some healthcare workers. To combat this, Weinerman and her team trained over 100 "vaccine champions" to provide accurate information and dispel myths about the vaccine. The champions come from diverse backgrounds and are available for one-on-one or group conversations. The program at Sunnybrook focuses on building trust and providing accessible information. Weinerman often starts her sessions by addressing common myths and falsehoods about the vaccine, creating an open and non-judgmental atmosphere. The team also offers confidential email support for those who may have more sensitive questions. As of this week, over 95% of Sunnybrook staff have received the COVID-19 vaccine, and Weinerman believes their efforts have made a significant impact. Dr. Ayisha Kurji, a pediatrician in Saskatoon, is impressed by the dedication of Weinerman and her team. She emphasizes the importance of providing information through different media and settings to help people make informed decisions. Building trust is crucial, and Kurji applauds the time and effort devoted to outreach by Weinerman's team. The article also highlights the perspective of Nurse Diana Beckford, who initially had fears and mistrust about the vaccine. However, after participating in Weinerman's online sessions, Beckford felt empowered to make an informed decision and chose to get vaccinated. She appreciated the opportunity to have her concerns addressed and felt that the information provided was profound and helped her overcome her hesitancy. Weinerman's approach, which combines education, accessibility, and trust-building, has proven effective in increasing vaccination rates among healthcare workers. By addressing hesitancy and providing support, healthcare facilities can ensure that their staff and patients are protected during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
