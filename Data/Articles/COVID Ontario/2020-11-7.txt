Title: This Paper Argues an Amulet May Protect from COVID. Should It Have Been Published?
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Dr. Moses Turkle Bility, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, published a controversial paper suggesting that a jade-nephrite amulet may prevent COVID-19. The paper combines concepts from various disciplines, including geophysics, public health, and quantum physics, and has been met with criticism and skepticism. In response, Dr. Bility defends his right to put forward unorthodox ideas and challenges the notion that only certain scientists are allowed to revolutionize a field. The paper's main argument revolves around the impact of changes in the Earth's magnetic field on the formation of iron oxide in rocks, which Bility links to the creation of functional viruses in human DNA sequences. He also suggests that ancient jade amulets may have been used to deflect magnetic fields and protect against diseases. However, the article highlights several issues with Dr. Bility's theory and the process of peer review. The author concludes that while academics should be free to propose radical ideas, these claims must be supported by rigorous evidence and subjected to thorough scrutiny to maintain the integrity of scientific literature. In summary, the retraction of Dr. Bility's paper and the subsequent discussion emphasize the importance of rigorous peer review for scientific publications, especially those making extraordinary claims. While open-mindedness is essential, bold assertions must be backed by extraordinary work to prevent the dissemination of misleading or pseudoscientific information.

Title: Canada quietly updates COVID-19 guidelines on risk of airborne spread
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Canada has recently updated its guidelines on COVID-19 transmission to include the risk of aerosol transmission. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) now acknowledges that the virus can spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols, which are tiny airborne particles. This change in guidance is significant as it highlights the importance of ventilation and mask quality in addition to social distancing. Linsey Marr, a top aerosol scientist, emphasizes that a combination of measures such as distancing, masks, and ventilation is necessary to prevent aerosol transmission. The update in guidelines comes as Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, recommended the use of three-layer non-medical masks to provide better protection against aerosols. This recommendation also emphasizes the importance of wearing masks indoors when around people from outside one's household. The PHAC's previous guidance focused primarily on respiratory droplets, contaminated surfaces, and physical distancing. The updated guidelines have implications for personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line health-care workers, as aerosolized particles can transmit the virus at short distances. Studies of superspreading events, such as a choir practice and a restaurant outbreak, have provided evidence for aerosol transmission. Additionally, virus particles were found in the air during a nursing home outbreak in Montreal, possibly due to a faulty ventilation system. These findings highlight the importance of addressing aerosol transmission through a combination of measures to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations and outbreaks.

Title: UCalgary lab helps support timely COVID-19 test results for international travellers
Publisher: University of Calgary
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The Governments of Canada and Alberta have launched a pilot project to test international travellers for COVID-19 at the Coutts border crossing and Calgary International Airport. The project, led by Alberta Health Services, Alberta Precision Laboratories, and the University of Calgary (UCalgary), aims to provide an alternative to the current 14-day quarantine requirement for international travellers while maintaining health and safety protocols. Those who test negative for COVID-19 will be allowed to leave quarantine early, provided they follow public health measures and undergo a second test 6-7 days after arrival. The University of Calgary's Hematology Translational Lab (HTL), which has expertise in molecular testing and sequencing, will analyze the samples. The lab has the capacity to process 600 samples per day using two different testing methods, with the potential to scale up if needed. The data collected will not only help identify positive cases but also provide valuable information on viral genomics, aiding in the understanding and management of different virus strains. This project is a collaborative effort to balance public health measures and travel while also generating critical data to combat COVID-19 and support Alberta's recovery plan.

The University of Calgary is establishing a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab to enhance research capabilities and commercialization opportunities for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The lab will enable researchers to study the complete life cycle of the virus and its impact on the body, advancing our understanding and potentially leading to new medications and treatments. The BSL-3 lab is funded by the Government of Canada and supported by various community partners. It features specialized equipment, including high-powered microscopes, and a unique ventilation system to contain pathogens. While a COVID-19 vaccine is likely over a year away, the lab could help discover approved drugs to aid in surviving the infection. The lab will also be useful in researching other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The University of Calgary's research strategy for Infections, Inflammation, and Chronic Diseases in the Changing Environment (IICD) aims to address key global challenges and improve health outcomes.

Title: Why Ontario hospitals are full to bursting, despite few COVID-19 patients
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: Ontario's hospitals are reaching full capacity, with some exceeding it, as they prepare for an expected surge in patients due to the flu season and the second wave of COVID-19. This overcrowding was a problem before the pandemic and has only been exacerbated by it. The province's maximum occupancy target is 85%, while a dozen major hospitals were filled above 95% of their capacity for most days in September and early October. Hospitals in Ottawa and the Greater Toronto Area, as well as some outside these regions, are operating at full capacity. According to Anthony Dale, CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association, hospitals are "walking across a tightrope", balancing their resources and patient demand. He warns that returning to pre-COVID overcrowding, where patients were housed in hallways and non-traditional spaces, is unacceptable during a pandemic due to the need for infection control. Hospital occupancy typically peaks in winter, which is a concern as COVID-19 cases are expected to rise. Health Minister Christine Elliott acknowledges the issue and states that the government is providing additional funding to create more capacity. However, this funding may not result in more nursing staff, according to Vicki McKenna, president of the Ontario Nurses Association. She highlights that nurses are already working beyond their normal hours and are concerned about the upcoming winter season. Despite patients with COVID-19 not being the primary driver of hospital occupancy in Ontario at the moment, any significant increase in these patients will "completely destabilize" hospital operations. Hospitals are already feeling the strain, with staff stretched thin and working hard to accommodate the current demand. To conclude, Ontario's hospitals are facing a challenging situation as they deal with high occupancy rates and prepare for an expected influx of patients. The government's additional funding may help create more capacity, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough to address the issue and prevent overcrowding during the pandemic.

Title: Immigrant women are falling behind during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on immigrant women in Canada, exacerbating existing social and gender-based inequalities. A survey of 50 high-skilled immigrant women revealed that 41 experienced negative effects on their employment due to the pandemic. The pandemic has caused delays, reversals, and interruptions in their career trajectories, leading to downward career mobility and talent waste. Immigrant women already faced barriers to employment due to deskilling, underemployment, and unemployment, and the pandemic has further exacerbated these issues. The shift to online environments and the increase in family responsibilities during lockdowns have particularly affected immigrant women, with many facing increased childcare and elder care burdens while struggling to balance work and family life. The long-term consequences of these challenges could be significant. Delayed or interrupted careers can hinder immigrant women from gaining necessary work experience, impacting their career advancement and job satisfaction. Their skills and experiences may be further devalued, and their psychological adjustment to Canada may suffer. Additionally, as the pandemic increases the demand for frontline workers in healthcare and essential services, immigrant women may remain stuck in low-level occupations. To address these issues, urgent measures are needed from the government, including support programs that provide financial and emergency assistance, reliable childcare, career coaching, mentoring, and mental health support. It is crucial to consider not just the immediate consequences of the pandemic but also to plan for a post-pandemic future that supports Canadian immigration policies and the well-being of immigrants who choose to make Canada their home.
