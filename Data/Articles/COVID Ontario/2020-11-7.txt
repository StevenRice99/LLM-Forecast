Title: Why COVID-19 cases are surging across Canada and what needs to be done
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Alberta is considering implementing a "circuit breaker" model to control COVID-19 cases, which involves brief lockdowns to interrupt transmission and reverse rising case numbers quickly.
Experts are warning that Alberta may be past the point of targeted restrictions due to rising community transmission and inadequate contact tracing, and that a short, sharp lockdown may be needed to re-engage the population.
British Columbia has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases, with record highs on Thursday and Friday. The province's hospitals are already stressed, and experts worry that if the situation is not brought under control, it could lead to widespread community transmission.
The Atlantic bubble, which consists of four provinces in eastern Canada, has been praised for its success in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, epidemiologists warn that vigilance is needed to avoid letting the guard down and allowing the virus to spread rapidly again.
In Nunavut, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on Friday, and health officials are working to contact trace and manage the situation.
Overall, experts are warning that complacency is not an option, and that strict public health measures need to be implemented to control the spread of COVID-19.

Title: What is a 'circuit breaker' lockdown, and should Canada consider one?
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Key points:
A shorter lockdown with a set end date can be effective in reducing cases and easing pressure on contact tracers.
An 18-20 day lockdown is recommended to drop cases effectively.
Clear messaging and discipline are crucial for public compliance during such a lockdown.
Testing has not been used proactively to control the virus, leading to increased case numbers and hospitalizations.
Ontario's current testing rates are insufficient to track transmission effectively.
A severe lockdown may be necessary in the future if cases continue to rise.

Summary: Finland's low COVID-19 infection rates are attributed to early government action (2-month lockdown), an effective test and trace system, high levels of trust towards authority, and a well-structured economy allowing remote work. These factors contributed to a lower peak in infections, but also highlighted the need for social support during prolonged lockdowns.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Government response time and effectiveness (early lockdown)
Test and trace system efficiency
Population's trust towards authority
Economic structure allowing remote work
Availability of social support during prolonged lockdowns

Many Ontario hospitals are at or above 95% capacity, exceeding the province's maximum occupancy target of 85%.
Hospital occupancy levels typically peak in winter, which is a concern due to expected surges in patients from flu season and COVID-19.
Province-wide figures show 350 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in hospital, including 72 in intensive care.
Increased funding ($351 million) has been pledged for 2,250 new beds in 57 hospital facilities around the province.

Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
The article discusses the importance of public health policies and measures such as wearing masks, hand washing, physical distancing, and staying home when sick to control case spread.
Ontario has reopened in three stages guided by epidemiology after the first COVID-19 peak.
Herd immunity occurs when a large enough proportion of the population (usually more than 70%) has immunity, which can be safely achieved by vaccines.
The article highlights the failure of naive approaches such as "herd immunity" through natural infection in controlling COVID-19 spread.
The province needs to prevent viral spread in the community to keep vulnerable people safe, particularly in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
