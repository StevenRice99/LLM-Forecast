Title: New Emergency Leave Provisions in NWT Employment Standards Act
Publisher: Government of Northwest Territories
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The Government of the Northwest Territories has made changes to the Employment Standards Act and Regulations to protect workers and provide flexibility to employers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes include the introduction of Emergency Leave, which allows NWT workers to take unpaid leave if they are unable to work due to an emergency like the COVID-19 public health crisis. This leave is retroactive to March 18, 2020, when the territory-wide public health emergency was declared. Employees terminated due to COVID-19 between this date and June 30, 2021, may file a complaint with the Employment Standards Office by January 2, 2022. These amendments are important for encouraging compliance with public health orders and allowing workers to access federal recovery benefits. Additionally, the amendments provide flexibility to employers by exempting them from the requirement to provide notice of group termination if they can demonstrate that an unforeseeable event or circumstance beyond their control prevented them from doing so. However, employers must still provide notice as soon as possible, and employees are still entitled to individual termination notice or pay in lieu. These changes aim to support both NWT workers and employers during the pandemic and future emergencies.

Title: Untangling introductions and persistence in COVID-19 resurgence in Europe
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a Bayesian evolutionary reconstruction of the timed phylogeographical history of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, incorporating genome sequences, their country and date of sampling, and epidemiological and mobility/connectivity data. The analysis focuses on simple model specifications and informing parameters with additional non-genetic data sources. The effective population size trajectory is modeled as a piecewise constant function that changes values at pre-specified times, with log-transformed population sizes as a deterministic function of log-transformed COVID-19 case counts. The process of transitioning through discrete location states is also modeled according to a continuous-time Markov chain, with log-transformed transition rates as a log-linear function of mobility and connectivity covariates. The article also mentions the use of data augmentation through online BEAST to update the dataset and reduce burn-in for subsequent analyses. Finally, the authors accommodate the time variability of mobility measures by constructing epoch model extensions that allow for the specification of arbitrary intervals and associated model parameterizations.

Title: COVID-19 deaths in Canada may be 2 times higher than reported, study finds
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A recent study suggests that Canada may have underestimated the number of COVID-19 deaths, with the true number potentially being twice as high as reported. The study found that a significant number of COVID-19 deaths may have occurred outside of long-term care homes, particularly in lower-income and racialized communities. The researchers adjusted the data to account for factors such as increased deaths due to drug toxicity and reduced traffic accident rates during the pandemic. They found that between February and November 2020, about 6,000 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 45 and older may have gone undetected or unreported. The study also highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities, with a high proportion of essential workers from these communities contracting the virus and dying from it. The researchers made several recommendations, including improved reporting of deaths to Statistics Canada and increased COVID-19 testing for all individuals who die. The findings suggest that the true burden of COVID-19 in Canada may be much higher than previously thought, which could have implications for forecasting hospitalizations and planning healthcare resources.

Title: Why reports of COVID-19 infections after 2 vaccine doses aren't cause for alarm
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the rare cases of COVID-19 infections in fully vaccinated individuals and provides important context for understanding their impact on the overall effectiveness of vaccination efforts. Here's a summary along with key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: While it may be concerning to hear about people getting infected with COVID-19 despite full vaccination, these "breakthrough infections" are rare and typically mild. In Canada and the US, data shows that breakthrough infections make up a very small percentage of reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Experts emphasize that no vaccine offers 100% protection, but the dramatic drop in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths demonstrates the vaccines' success in preventing severe illness. Mild breakthrough infections do not strain the healthcare system, and vaccinated individuals are far less likely to require hospitalization, oxygen, or mechanical ventilation. While rare, some vaccinated individuals may still experience severe illness due to individual variations in immune response. Despite the overall effectiveness, there are concerns that reports of post-vaccination cases and deaths could fuel hesitancy among unvaccinated individuals. Important Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: In Canada, as of June 21, there were 2,731 cases of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated individuals out of nearly 34 million vaccine doses administered. Breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals in Canada represent just 0.5% of reported COVID-19 cases since the vaccine rollout started in December. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), individuals who get COVID-19 after partial or full vaccination are less likely to die compared to unvaccinated individuals. The protective effect was significant among partially vaccinated people over 60 and fully vaccinated people over 80. In the US, an Associated Press analysis found that breakthrough infections accounted for about 0.1% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and 0.8% of deaths in May. Vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough infections tend to have milder symptoms, reducing the strain on healthcare resources and hospitalizations. Primary care physicians, community outreach, and clear messaging about vaccine effectiveness are crucial for addressing hesitancy and reaching vulnerable communities. In conclusion, while breakthrough infections do occur, they are rare and generally result in milder illness. The data strongly indicates that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization, underscoring the importance of continuing vaccination efforts to protect individuals and communities.

Title: 15 months, 3 waves: How COVID-19 coursed through the capital
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ottawa, Canada, began in March 2020 and peaked in late April with 784 active cases and 95 deaths in the first six weeks. The high mortality rate during this wave pushed the city's older population to take precautions and reduce their exposure. The second wave was characterized by multiple ebbs and flows over five months, with a peak of 1,501 active cases in early October. Summer parties and increased community spread contributed to this spike. The reopening of schools did not lead to significant in-school transmission, and schools remained open through the end of 2020. However, the holiday break in December led to increased shopping and indoor gatherings, resulting in another spike in cases. The second wave was followed by a lockdown in late December, which helped reduce the number of active cases. The third wave of the pandemic in Ottawa was more severe than the previous two, with a peak of 3,789 active cases in mid-April 2021. The alpha variant contributed to the accelerated spread of the virus, leading to another school closure. The reopening of the city and province in late winter was premature and contributed to the spread of the alpha variant before the vaccine could make a significant impact. The path forward involves a slow reopening coupled with the vaccine rollout, with the delta variant expected to make a larger impact in Ottawa starting in July. As of Friday, 26% of Ottawa adults were fully vaccinated, and that number is expected to rise steadily in the coming weeks.
