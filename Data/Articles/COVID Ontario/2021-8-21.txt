This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Children under 12 are not eligible for vaccination in Ontario, making them more susceptible to the delta variant.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The province of Ontario is planning to set up COVID-19 immunization clinics in schools and nearby locations to reach unvaccinated youth, who have the lowest vaccination rate among eligible age cohorts (69% with one dose and 55% fully vaccinated). The clinics are part of a "last mile" government vaccination strategy to make vaccines more accessible to students, families, and school staff. Daily COVID-19 infections have been steadily rising in Ontario, with 526 new cases reported on Monday, and the majority of recent new cases have been in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals. The province's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table estimates that 91% of cases are caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant, which is driving fresh waves of cases and hospitalizations around the world. Cases are doubling every nine days, and the province's top doctor expects cases to rise further in the fall when people spend more time indoors. The province is not planning to close schools again, but boards have been directed to plan for that possibility. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Vaccination rates among youth and other age cohorts Daily COVID-19 infections and case growth rate Prevalence of the Delta variant Expected increase in cases in the fall due to increased indoor activities Plans for vaccination clinics and accessibility Possibility of school closures and impact on hospitalizations These values can be used to inform forecasting models and predict potential hospitalization rates in Ontario, Canada.

Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The Rideau Carleton Casino in Ottawa is reopening with a phased approach, starting with slots and electronic table games, and dining and beverages available at certain locations. The casino will operate at 50% maximum capacity indoors, with patrons and staff required to wear face masks and maintain physical distance. The casino has implemented a "Safe and Sound" protocol system, including increased cleaning and touchless hand sanitizers. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The reopening of a large indoor gathering space, such as a casino, may lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases and potentially hospitalizations. The 50% capacity limit and mask-wearing requirements may mitigate the risk of transmission, but the effectiveness of these measures will depend on compliance and enforcement. The article mentions the casino's safety protocols, but it is unclear how well these measures will be implemented and whether they will be sufficient to prevent outbreaks. Overall, this article suggests that there may be an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission in Ottawa due to the reopening of the casino, which could potentially lead to an increase in hospitalizations. However, the impact will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of the safety protocols and the behavior of patrons and staff.
