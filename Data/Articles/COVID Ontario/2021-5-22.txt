This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The study analyzed 25 years of data (1995-2019) on healthcare resource utilization in Ontario, Canada, and found: Decreasing rates of hospitalizations across all age groups Increasing rates of emergency department visits, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation, particularly among younger adults Rates of mechanical ventilation were already increasing pre-pandemic, indicating a growing baseline need for ICU capacity Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Decreasing hospitalization rates may not be indicative of future COVID-19 hospitalization trends, as the pandemic has changed healthcare utilization patterns. Increasing rates of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation among younger adults may indicate a need for increased ICU capacity, which should be considered when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. The growing baseline need for ICU capacity pre-pandemic should be accounted for when planning for post-pandemic ICU capacity.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: The province-wide pause on non-urgent surgeries has been lifted, and hospitals can gradually resume procedures if they have the capacity. New cases, hospitalizations, and intensive care admissions appear to be trending downward. The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 has declined from 2,360 on April 20 to 1,401. Intensive care units remain under strain, with 735 people with COVID-19 taking up beds, down from 900 earlier this month.

These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they indicate a decline in hospitalizations and intensive care admissions, but also highlight the ongoing strain on the healthcare system and the potential for a significant backlog of surgical procedures.
