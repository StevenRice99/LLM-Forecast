Title: The true death toll of COVID-19 estimating global excess mortality
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
As of January 30, 2020, there were 171 official deaths from COVID-19, and by December 31, 2020, that number had risen to 1,813,188. However, it is estimated that the actual number of COVID-19-related deaths in 2020 was at least 3 million, which is 1.2 million more than the official count. The undercount of deaths may be due to differences in testing and reporting procedures across countries, as well as the lack of accurate and complete data on deaths and their causes in many countries. To address this, some countries have used excess mortality, which takes into account the total number of deaths above what would be expected without the pandemic, as a more accurate measure of the pandemic's impact. Excess mortality includes both direct and indirect deaths related to COVID-19, such as those caused by disruptions to essential health services.

Title: Covid 'hate crimes' against Asian Americans on rise
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in violent attacks and hate crimes against Asian Americans, often linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the spread of the virus. The FBI warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against those of Asian descent at the beginning of the outbreak, and while official data for 2020 is not yet available, reports from advocacy groups and local law enforcement suggest a significant increase in anti-Asian hate incidents. The issue has gained widespread attention, with celebrities and influencers speaking out and President Biden signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law to address the rising rate of anti-Asian attacks. California, with the largest Asian American population in the US, has seen a particularly high number of hate incidents, with reports of physical assaults, verbal harassment, and discrimination. Activists and advocates attribute the violence to rising anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating of the Asian community for the pandemic. They call for increased visibility, cultural shifts, and systematic changes to combat the issue.

Title: The Consumer Price Index and COVID-19: A One-Year Retrospective
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic disruptions, including shifts in consumer prices and spending. In April and May 2020, consumer prices in Canada fell by 0.2% and 0.4% respectively compared to the previous year. While some prices, such as energy products, have recovered, the pandemic's impact continues to affect the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The pandemic caused record price movements for energy products and travel services, with prices for traveler accommodation and fuel oil falling significantly. Consumer prices at the gas pumps dropped by over 30% between February and April 2020 due to reduced demand and increased supply. The pandemic also led to sharp declines in prices for clothing and footwear, with non-essential retail stores closed for much of the year. Prices for air transportation and clothing declined for several months year-over-year. Interest rates fell to historically low levels at the onset of the pandemic, impacting mortgage interest rates and leading to significant gains in the homeowners' replacement cost index. Rent prices also experienced upward pressure due to higher vacancy rates caused by reduced demand from immigrants and students. Supply shortages during the pandemic also impacted consumer prices, particularly for household cleaning products, paper supplies, and certain foods. Outbreaks at meat processing plants led to temporary supply constraints and higher prices for beef and pork. The increased demand for new homes and renovations contributed to a lumber shortage, impacting prices for new homes and wooden furniture. Base-year effects from March and April 2020 are temporarily putting upward pressure on headline consumer inflation. The broad decline in prices during the onset of the pandemic has led to a temporary upward impact on year-over-year consumer inflation in March and April 2021. However, as the price declines fall out of the 12-month comparison, the upward pressure on inflation will be temporary. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of vaccination rates, public health measures, and the prevalence of variants of concern. The relationship between consumer prices and hospitalizations is indirect, but economic disruptions and behavioral changes due to price fluctuations can influence hospitalization rates.

Title: Mental Health and Substance Use During COVID-19: Summary Report
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and substance use of Canadians, based on a survey of 4,000 residents. Here are the key findings and their implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Increased Substance Use: Up to one in two individuals with existing substance use disorders reported increased substance use, particularly cannabis and alcohol. This could lead to a higher number of hospitalizations due to substance-related health issues, such as liver damage or respiratory problems. Mental Health Concerns: A significant number of respondents with mental health symptoms reported increased substance use, with up to one in two experiencing depressive symptoms and moderate to severe anxiety. Mental health concerns can impact an individual's ability to follow public health guidelines, seek medical help, or effectively manage their condition, potentially leading to more hospitalizations. Stressors: Financial situations, social isolation, and family health concerns were the top stressors for respondents. These stressors can contribute to both mental health issues and increased substance use, and they may also impact an individual's ability to access healthcare services, potentially leading to more severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization. High-Risk Groups: Individuals with pre-existing substance use disorders or mental health diagnoses are at particular risk, with higher rates of moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms. These groups may require additional support and resources to manage their conditions effectively and reduce the likelihood of hospitalization. Household Size and Income: Other reports in this series highlight the impact of gender, household size, income, and employment on mental health and substance use. These factors can influence the spread of COVID-19 and the ability to access healthcare, potentially impacting hospitalization rates. In summary, the article suggests that the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and substance use could lead to increased hospitalizations, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions, financial stressors, or social isolation. Forecasting models should consider these factors to anticipate healthcare needs and allocate resources effectively.

Upadhyay tries to minimize her risk of infection by driving to work instead of taking the bus. She feels stressed and anxious about the risk of infection at work and the unpredictable nature of the disease. Gurinder Singh Khehra, 53: Khehra experienced severe symptoms of COVID-19 and was hospitalized twice, requiring a ventilator. He still struggles with physical symptoms, including weight loss and breathlessness. Khehra also describes the mental toll the disease has taken on him and his family, particularly his wife, who found him lifeless at home. He emphasizes the importance of taking precautions and staying home if possible to break the chain of infection. The article highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on essential workers, particularly those living in high-risk areas like Peel Region. It underscores the importance of following safety protocols, such as wearing face masks and maintaining physical distance, to protect essential workers and slow the spread of the virus. The personal stories shared in the article provide a glimpse into the human cost of the pandemic and the ongoing struggles faced by those affected. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider various factors, including vaccination rates, adherence to public health measures, and the prevalence of variants of concern. The experiences shared in the article highlight the vulnerability of essential workers and the potential for rapid spread in high-density living situations. By learning from these stories and continuing to prioritize the protection of essential workers and vulnerable communities, we can work towards reducing hospitalizations and saving lives.

Title: Excess Mortality in Ontario During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True

Here is a summary of the article: This article examines excess mortality in Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing cremation records. It found that there was an overall 12.8% increase in cremations per week compared to pre-pandemic years (2017-2019). The largest increases in excess mortality were observed in April 2020 (+32.2%), May 2020 (+19.9%), and January 2021 (+17.0%), coinciding with the peaks of the first and second waves of COVID-19. Excess mortality was observed across all age groups, with 78.2% of excess deaths occurring among those aged 65 and older in 2020. From January to March 2021, the majority of excess mortality (52.8%) was observed in the 65-84 age group. Interestingly, confirmed COVID-19 deaths did not account for all excess mortality. During the first wave (March to May 2020), COVID-19 deaths accounted for 43.5% of excess deaths, while in the early part of the second wave (August to December 2020), they accounted for 29%. From January to March 2021, COVID-19 deaths accounted for 73.1% of excess deaths. The findings suggest that the increase in non-COVID-19 deaths could be attributed to delayed care for other conditions and indirect effects of the pandemic, such as an increase in opioid-related deaths. The analysis used Ontario's electronic cremation certificates, with data grouped by month and age, to calculate excess mortality compared to the pre-pandemic average. In summary, the article highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall mortality in Ontario, with excess deaths occurring across all age groups and only partially explained by confirmed COVID-19 cases. These findings have important implications for understanding the full scope of the pandemic's impact and can inform public health measures and healthcare resource allocation.

Title: Fake news on Facebook: 18 million posts containing COVID-19 misinformation removed - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Facebook and Instagram have removed 18 million pieces of COVID-19 misinformation since the pandemic began, with an additional 167 million pieces of content labeled "false" by fact-checkers. Facebook's Community Standards Enforcement Report revealed these numbers for the first quarter of 2021, along with their efforts to promote vaccine acceptance and provide accurate vaccine information. Social media companies have faced scrutiny for their role in spreading misinformation, especially regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. Platforms like Facebook aim to balance free speech with halting misinformation, but experts argue that the spread of medical misinformation can lead to tangible harm or even death. While Facebook's recent efforts are positive, they may be too little too late as users have already been exposed to extensive misinformation, potentially driving them to more extreme sites. The company has also removed nearly 10 million pieces of organized hate content in Q1 2021, up from 6.4 million in the previous quarter.
