Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of Canadians, specifically youth aged 12 to 17, adults aged 18 to 64, and older adults aged 65 and over. The findings are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collected in fall 2018 (pre-COVID) and fall 2020 (during COVID). Key findings include: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 37.2% of youth aged 12 to 17 met the Canadian physical activity recommendations, compared to 50.8% pre-pandemic. There was no significant change in the percentage of adults aged 18 to 64 meeting the recommendations, while there was an increase in physical activity among seniors aged 65 and over (from 35.4% in 2018 to 40.3% in 2020). Youth reported significantly fewer minutes of physical activity from recreation and school in fall 2020 compared to fall 2018, while there was no change in physical activity from active transportation or household chores. Adults and older adults reported a slight increase in physical activity from recreation, while older adults also increased their physical activity from household chores or work/volunteering. Workers who worked from home due to the pandemic reported fewer total minutes of physical activity compared to other workers, mainly due to decreases in active transportation and household/occupation-related activity. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors could be important to consider: Physical activity levels: Lower physical activity levels may impact overall health and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms requiring hospitalization. School closures and restrictions: The decrease in physical activity among youth due to school closures and restrictions on sports may impact their overall health and immunity. Work-from-home policies: The decrease in physical activity among workers who work from home may impact their health and COVID-19 risk. Mental health: The pandemic and physical distancing measures may have negatively affected mental health, which could impact overall health and COVID-19 severity. Overall, the article provides insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical activity levels of Canadians, particularly youth. These findings can help inform public health policies and strategies to promote physical activity and mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on the health of Canadians.

Title: What COVID-19 teaches us about “the individual versus collective action debate” in climate policy
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the "individual versus collective action debate" in the context of climate policy and draws parallels with the political response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are the key points and their relevance to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Lessons from COVID-19 for climate policy: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that individual and collective changes can complement each other. This is relevant for climate change as it requires significant shifts in human behavior, similar to the behavioral changes needed to flatten the epidemiological curve during the pandemic. Behavioral changes and their costs: Lockdown policies during COVID-19 were an example of collective action, but they came with socio-political costs, including restrictions on freedom, economic impacts, and social inequalities. This leads to a debate between enforcing collective changes or encouraging voluntary individual actions. Vaccine mandates and incentives: The discussion around COVID-19 vaccinations mirrors the climate policy debate. Mandates are effective but seen as a violation of individual choice, while incentives (e.g., education campaigns, free distribution) are often preferred in democracies despite potentially lower uptake. Role of individual and collective changes: The COVID-19 response suggests that a combination of individual and collective changes is beneficial. Collective actions are usually more effective but come with higher costs, so a mix of policies is needed. Individual-oriented policies can fill the gap when collective policies are less comprehensive due to affordability or other constraints. Incentives and accommodations: When advocating for individual action, governments should provide incentives and support, such as making vaccines free. Similarly, with collective responses, exceptions should be considered, like accommodating those who cannot be vaccinated in vaccine passport systems. Addressing inequalities: Both COVID-19 and climate policies must address underlying social and economic inequalities. Lack of support for low-income workers during COVID-19 hindered collective efforts, and climate policies (e.g., rebates for electric vehicles) should not exclude large segments of the population. Targeting high-impact individuals: In both crises, a small number of individuals can cause significant damage. Targeting these individuals, such as social media influencers spreading misinformation or the "polluter elite," can be more effective than a blanket approach. Opposition and role models: Attempts to change behavior will always face opposition, as seen with COVID-19 despite scientific evidence. This suggests that a combination of voluntary actions and collective changes with penalties for non-compliance is needed. Role models who showcase the benefits of compliance can also influence behavior. In summary, the article argues that the COVID-19 response provides insights for climate policy, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that considers individual and collective changes, addresses inequalities, targets high-impact individuals, and utilizes incentives and role models to navigate the complex "individual versus collective action debate." While this article does not provide direct methods for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the lessons learned from the pandemic's response can inform future policy decisions and public behavior, which could indirectly impact hospitalization rates.

Title: Applying the Guidelines for Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Older Adults in Canada during COVID-19
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of addressing the mental health needs of older adults in Canada, a population already at risk for mental health issues due to factors such as social isolation and physical health declines. Most COVID-19 deaths in Canada have occurred in long-term care homes, illustrating the disproportionate impact of the virus on older adults. While the physical health consequences of COVID-19 have been significant, the pandemic has also taken a toll on the mental health of this vulnerable population. The current and potential future mental health impacts of COVID-19 on older adults are severe and require a comprehensive response from the healthcare system. To address these concerns, a multi-faceted approach is necessary, including: Promoting wellbeing and mental health: This can be done through initiatives that foster social connections, provide meaningful activities, and offer emotional support. Incorporating prevention and early intervention: Screening and assessment tools can help identify mental health issues early on, allowing for timely intervention and potentially preventing more severe problems. Providing integrated services: An integrated approach that combines health, mental health, and social services can ensure that older adults receive holistic care that addresses their physical and mental health needs. Delivering high-quality care: Ensuring access to specialized geriatric mental health services and trained professionals can improve the quality of care and outcomes for older adults experiencing mental health issues. By implementing these strategies, the healthcare system can better respond to the mental health needs of older adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially reducing hospitalizations related to mental health crises and improving overall well-being in this population.

Title: 'I apologize': Kenney says Alta. wrong for COVID-19 pandemic to endemic shift, not sorry for Open for Summer plan
Publisher: CTV News Edmonton
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has apologized for his government's handling of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically for lifting public health restrictions too quickly based on provincial modeling. Kenney announced new restrictions and a proof-of-vaccination program but defended his "Open for Summer" plan, stating that sustaining lockdowns permanently is unrealistic. The province marked a record number of ICU admissions, and Alberta Health Services is seeking assistance from neighboring provinces. University of Calgary associate professor Lorian Hardcastle commented on the premier's apology, suggesting that it indicates a willingness to change his pandemic approach. Independent MLAs Drew Barnes and Todd Loewen have called for Kenney's resignation due to negligent pandemic management, but Hardcastle predicts that Kenney is unlikely to step down. She highlights growing criticism within his party and challenges ahead for his leadership. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts are important to consider: The current wave of the pandemic has led to a record number of ICU admissions in Alberta, indicating a strain on healthcare resources. The Delta variant is likely a significant contributor to the rising cases and hospitalizations, as it is more transmissible. The slow vaccination uptake mentioned in the article could result in a larger pool of susceptible individuals, potentially leading to more hospitalizations. The government's new restrictions and proof-of-vaccination program may help curb the spread and reduce hospitalizations, but the impact depends on compliance and uptake. Seeking assistance from neighboring provinces indicates a severe situation, and the additional resources may help manage hospitalizations to some extent.

Title: Cyberbullying and COVID-19: How can we make online spaces safer?
Publisher: McGill University
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and teens' increased exposure to online hate and violence, leading to a rise in cyberbullying. Here are the key points and some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in children and teens spending more time online, increasing their exposure to online hate and violence. Studies indicate a rise in online hate and violence experienced by children and teens during the pandemic, with calls to crisis lines soaring. Mental health concerns and stressors, such as parental job loss and health anxiety, may contribute to the increase in cyberbullying incidents. Cyberbullying is defined as repeated aggressive and intentional acts using electronic forms of contact, causing various negative impacts on victims, including depression, anxiety, and lower academic performance. Certain groups, such as 2SLGBTQIA+ students and young women, are more vulnerable to cyberbullying and its severe forms. Teachers play a crucial role in preventing and addressing cyberbullying, but many feel ill-equipped and require more training. A holistic approach involving teachers, parents, and students is necessary to address cyberbullying effectively and create safer online and learning environments. As the pandemic continues to highlight the prevalence of cyberbullying, immediate action and further research are needed to develop effective strategies. While the article focuses on cyberbullying and its impact on mental health, it does not directly provide facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the discussion of mental health concerns and stressors among children and teens during the pandemic could indirectly influence hospitalization rates. Increased mental health issues may lead to a higher risk of self-harm, substance abuse, or other behaviors that could ultimately require hospitalization. Additionally, the indirect impact of cyberbullying on physical health, such as lower immune function due to chronic stress, could potentially contribute to COVID-19 hospitalization rates in the affected age groups.

Title: Understanding the Post COVID-19 Condition (Long COVID) and the Expected Burden for Ontario
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the post-COVID-19 condition, also known as "Long COVID," which refers to the various potential health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of September 3, 2021, there had been over 567,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario, Canada. Defining the post-COVID-19 condition is challenging due to a lack of consensus on definitions and terminology. The article presents various definitions from different organizations, all of which characterize the condition as the persistence of symptoms beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposes a disease framework for the post-COVID-19 condition, dividing it into two overlapping constructs: prolonged symptoms related to the infection itself and symptoms/sequelae observed in survivors of critical illness and hospitalization. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells via the ACE2 receptor and can cause organ damage and physiological dysfunction, leading to a wide range of symptoms across multiple organ systems. The potential underlying causes of the post-COVID-19 condition include neurologic dysfunction, immune-related phenomena, and organ dysfunction. These factors can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive issues, and organ damage. Studies comparing COVID-19 patients to non-infected controls have found that certain symptoms and health outcomes are more common in those with COVID-19, suggesting a link between the infection and the post-COVID-19 condition. The prevalence of the post-COVID-19 condition varies widely across studies due to differing definitions and methodologies. Estimates range from 2% to 89% of infected individuals experiencing symptoms beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. The WHO estimates that about 1 in 4 infected individuals experience symptoms for at least a month, and 1 in 10 experience symptoms beyond 12 weeks. The pattern and prevalence of symptoms change over time, with short-term and long-term sequelae associated with the post-COVID-19 condition. Common short-term symptoms include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, and dyspnea. Long-term symptoms can include chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and fibromyalgia-like symptoms. The impact of the post-COVID-19 condition on health system utilization, functional limitations, and long-term disability/unemployment benefits is still being studied. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations requires considering the potential long-term effects of the virus on patients' health. The variability in the definition and understanding of the post-COVID-19 condition makes it challenging to predict its exact impact on healthcare systems. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the potential long-term consequences of COVID-19, highlighting the need for further research and preparedness in healthcare systems to address the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.

COVID-19 in Pregnant Individuals: Incidence, Severity, and Outcomes This article summarizes the current knowledge about COVID-19 in pregnant individuals, focusing on incidence, severity, and outcomes. The PregCOVID living systematic review and Canadian Surveillance of COVID-19 in Pregnancy (CANCOVID) team provide valuable data. Incidence: The incidence of COVID-19 in pregnancy doesn't appear higher, but pregnant individuals may have a higher rate of asymptomatic infection. The second and third trimesters are when most SARS-CoV-2 infections occur. Severity: 7-15% of pregnant individuals with COVID-19 experience moderate to severe disease. They have a significantly higher relative rate of hospitalization and ICU admission compared to non-pregnant peers. The need for mechanical ventilation indicates clinically severe disease. Variants of Concern (VOCs): The increased relative risk of hospitalization and ICU admission may be driven by VOCs like the Alpha variant. There is limited data on the Delta variant's impact. Outcomes: Pregnant patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure face increased risks of maternal morbidity, mortality, and poor neonatal outcomes. The INTERCOVID cohort study reported a 22-fold increased risk of maternal death. Risk factors for severity and mortality include high BMI, non-white ethnicity, and increasing maternal age. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes show higher rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, and Cesarean delivery. There is limited evidence of COVID-19 infection in newborns.

Title: When will international air travel soar again after COVID-19?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
International air travel is slowly recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's still far below pre-pandemic levels. Experts say that a return to normal levels of travel is dependent on global coordination and agreement on COVID-19 tests and vaccination documentation. The International Air Transport Association reported a 60% decrease in passengers in 2020 compared to 2019, and in July 2021, international travel demand was still down by nearly three-quarters. Canadian airlines are optimistic about the future, but it's difficult to forecast exactly when the industry will recover. Vaccine passports are being considered as a way to encourage international travel, but there are challenges in coordinating policies across different countries. The Canadian federal government and various political parties have different plans and ideas for safely reopening international travel. Some observers believe the pandemic may permanently shift airline travel patterns, with fewer work trips and more reliance on technology for conducting business. However, others believe that business travel will eventually recover as people want to travel and value mobility.
