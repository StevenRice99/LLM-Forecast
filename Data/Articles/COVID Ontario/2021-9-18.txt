Title: These charts show how much more often unvaccinated Albertans are being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Vaccination status significantly affects hospitalization rates, with unvaccinated individuals at higher risk.
Age is a critical factor in determining hospitalization rates, with older adults (80+) having the highest rates of hospitalization and death.
Rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death are significantly lower among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals, regardless of age group.
The data analysis controlled for population sizes and accounted for the increased risk of severe outcomes with age.

Title: The Incidence, Severity, and Management of COVID-19 in Critically Ill Pregnant Individuals
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
This Science Brief provides an update on the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on pregnant individuals and highlights key considerations for their care.
Key Findings: 
1. Infection Incidence: Pregnant individuals have a similar incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to non-pregnant women of the same age.
2. Asymptomatic Infection: However, they are more likely to have asymptomatic infections.
3. Severe Illness: Pregnant individuals with COVID-19 are at higher risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-pregnant patients with similar characteristics.
4. Maternal Mortality and Morbidity: The incidence of maternal mortality, cesarean delivery, and preterm birth is higher among pregnant individuals with COVID-19.
5. Fetal Outcomes: Minimal fetal adverse effects were reported, and neonatal acquisition was low.
Recommendations: 
1. Vaccination: COVID-19 vaccination is crucial for minimizing morbidity and mortality in pregnant individuals, especially given the emergence of VOCs (Variants of Concern).
2. Tailored Messaging: Pregnant individuals should receive tailored messaging to increase vaccine confidence and uptake.
3. Shared Decision-Making Frameworks: Support tools like those provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health can facilitate shared decision-making between healthcare providers and patients.
Considerations for Severe Cases: 
1. Transfer to a Specialized Centre: Pregnant individuals with severe ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) should be transferred to a centre with high-risk obstetrics, critical care obstetrical expertise, and high-level neonatal ICUs.
2. Telemedicine Consultation: Telemedicine can expand access to specialist expertise if not locally available.
3. Timing of Delivery: When considering prone positioning or ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) in late third trimester pregnancy, discuss the timing of delivery with obstetrical care providers.
Call for Research: 
1. Inclusion of Pregnant Individuals: Future randomized trials should include pregnant individuals to provide them with equal access to treatments and vaccines during pandemics.
2. Streamlined Approach: A streamlined approach should be developed for rapid consideration of safety and efficacy of therapies in the pregnant population.
3. Knowledge Translation Initiatives: Initiatives should be implemented to minimize hesitancy among healthcare providers regarding enrollment of pregnant individuals in clinical trials.

The number of fully vaccinated individuals (42 in general hospital wards and 15 in ICUs)

Title: Want to cut your risk of serious COVID-19? New data shows vaccines are hitting the mark
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses recent data on breakthrough infections of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated individuals. Despite the high vaccination rates in many countries, there are cases where people who have been fully vaccinated are still getting infected with COVID-19.
According to a study at one hospital, nearly half of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 did not show symptoms, and those who did had severe or critical illness, including three deaths. The majority of these patients were seniors, had other chronic illnesses, or were on immunosuppressive drugs. 
The article also highlights data from Israel, where about half of the country's roughly 600 COVID-19 hospitalizations were people who had two rounds of Pfizer-BioNTech shots. Again, most of those seriously ill patients were seniors, had other chronic illnesses, or were on immunosuppressive drugs.
Several experts in infectious diseases and public health are quoted in the article, emphasizing that while breakthrough infections do occur, they are relatively rare compared to the overall number of vaccinated individuals. They also stress that vaccines have been effective in preventing severe infection, hospitalization, and death.
The debate over whether to offer additional vaccine doses (booster shots) to give people's immune systems an extra boost is ongoing. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends providing a third vaccine dose to certain people with weaker immune systems. However, experts such as Dr. Isaac Bogoch from the University of Health Network in Toronto are cautious about offering booster shots to the general public, arguing that it may not be necessary for younger residents.
The article concludes by emphasizing that vaccines have been effective overall but may need to be adapted for specific groups, such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.
