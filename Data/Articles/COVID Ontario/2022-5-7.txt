Title: PAHO Establishes High-Level Commission on Mental Health and COVID-19
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, with a 25% increase in global anxiety and depression rates in the first year. The PAHO analysis found neurological or mental disorders in one-third of COVID-19 patients in the Region, and depression symptoms in 14.7-22% of health personnel. The new High-level Commission on Mental Health and COVID-19 aims to address these issues with a focus on recovery, vulnerable populations, integration, financing, and prevention. The commission consists of various experts in the field, including leaders from health organizations, academics, and civil society members. They will prepare evidence-based recommendations to improve mental health services and transform mental health systems, with a report expected by the end of 2022. This initiative is particularly important given the historically low priority of mental health in the Americas, which has hindered the ability to respond adequately during the pandemic.

Title: Youth mental health in the spotlight again, as pandemic drags on
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young Canadians and provides some data and perspectives on this topic. Here are the key points: National Child and Youth Mental Health Day in Canada is observed annually on May 7, highlighting the importance of this issue for children and parents. According to data from late March and early April 2020, just over 40% of Canadian youth (aged 15-24) reported excellent or very good mental health, a significant drop from 62% in 2018, representing the largest decline among all age groups. Crowdsourced data from the early weeks of the pandemic indicate that 57% of participants aged 15-17 reported a worsening of their mental health since the implementation of physical distancing measures. Statistics Canada's 2019 report links youth mental health to income, with those from poorer households reporting poorer mental health and a higher likelihood of considering suicide. Remote learning during the pandemic has also had an impact, and data from 2019 suggest that children already struggling with mental health issues may be especially vulnerable. There is a disconnect between how youth and their parents perceive mental health, with over half of youth aged 12-17 differing from their parents' perception, and two-thirds rating their mental health less positively than their parents. The article also features a podcast episode where a kindergarten teacher, a pediatrician, an occupational therapist, and students share their personal experiences and adaptations during the pandemic. Looking forward, there is hope for a return to normal routines and activities in the fall, which is expected to have positive mental health benefits for children and youth. While the article focuses on the mental health impacts, it's important to consider other factors that could influence COVID-19 hospitalizations in the future. These include vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, and the potential for long-COVID or post-COVID complications that may require hospitalization.

Title: How prisons are using COVID-19 containment measures as a guise for torture
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the ongoing use of torture in federal prison segregation units and Ontario provincial jails, with a focus on the increased use of isolation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors, critical criminology and policy scholars, have gathered data through prisoner interviews and freedom-of-information requests, finding that four forms of forced isolation (lockdowns, COVID-19 quarantines, droplet precautions, and structured intervention/segregation) are being abused in ways that approach or meet the UN definition of torture. The frequency and length of isolation have increased during the pandemic, often lasting longer than the UN-defined 15-day threshold for torture. The authors also highlight the lack of external oversight and accountability, with the Ontario government dismantling Community Advisory Boards that provided independent oversight of the province's jails. They call for the reinstatement of these boards and for the government to acclaim the Correctional Services and Reintegration Act, which aligns with international standards for segregation. The article also mentions the high percentage of prisoners who have not been convicted of any crimes and advocates for their release, especially in light of the health risks posed by COVID-19 in prisons. Overall, the article raises serious concerns about the use of torture in Canadian prisons and the need for urgent policy changes to protect the human rights of prisoners.

Publisher: OECD
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains and the policies that can be used to address the challenges arising from this dispersion of value chain activities. Here is a summary: Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, exposing vulnerabilities and creating challenges for policymakers. The trend towards dispersing value chain activities internationally has led to a complex network of interconnected economies and industries. This dispersion offers benefits such as risk diversification and access to specialized resources, but it also presents challenges when it comes to coordinating responses during a global crisis. To address these challenges, the article suggests the following policies: 1. Information Sharing and Transparency: Governments should promote transparency and encourage information sharing between businesses and governments. This includes sharing data on production, inventories, and demand to help identify potential bottlenecks and supply disruptions. 2. Collaboration and Coordination: Policymakers should facilitate collaboration and coordination among businesses and industries, especially in critical sectors like healthcare and food supply. This can involve creating platforms for information exchange, joint planning, and the development of contingency plans. 3. Supply Chain Resilience: Policies should focus on building resilience into supply chains. This includes diversifying supplier bases, developing local and regional supply chains, and encouraging the maintenance of strategic reserves of critical goods. Governments can provide incentives for companies to invest in resilience measures and promote supply chain risk management practices. 4. Agile and Flexible Manufacturing: Policies should support the development of agile and flexible manufacturing systems. This involves promoting technologies such as 3D printing, advanced robotics, and digital supply chain management solutions that enable rapid reconfiguration of production processes and supply chains. 5. Strategic Investment and Incentives: Governments can provide strategic investments and incentives to support critical industries and supply chains. This could include targeted tax breaks, subsidies, or grants to encourage domestic production of critical goods, development of local supply chains, or investment in resilient manufacturing practices. 6. International Cooperation: International cooperation is crucial to address global supply chain challenges. Policymakers should engage in dialogues, share best practices, and develop coordinated responses to ensure the smooth flow of goods and services across borders. By implementing these policies, governments can help mitigate the impact of disruptions caused by events like the COVID-19 pandemic and improve the resilience of global supply chains. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models for prediction. However, the policies mentioned above, particularly those related to information sharing and transparency, can help gather the necessary data to forecast hospitalizations more accurately. Transparent reporting of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and healthcare capacity data can enable better forecasting and resource allocation. Additionally, collaboration between healthcare providers and government agencies can facilitate the development of more robust forecasting models and improve preparedness for potential surges in hospitalizations.

Title: COVID-19: updates for Canada’s universities — University Affairs
Publisher: University Affairs
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
As of May 1, 2022, several universities in Ontario, including the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Guelph, have lifted their vaccine requirements, while choosing to maintain their indoor masking policies. This aligns with the province's decision to lift mask mandates in most indoor places on March 14. However, some universities in Ontario, such as the University of Windsor, Trent University, and the University of British Columbia, have extended their indoor mask mandates beyond this date. The lifting of vaccine requirements comes as Ontario experiences a sixth wave of COVID-19, with record-high indicators of the virus in wastewater. This has caused concern among students, with some universities choosing to maintain or even extend their mask and vaccination mandates. For example, Carleton University has extended its masking and vaccine requirements, and Queen's University has extended its mask mandate until the end of May. The University of Ottawa has taken a different approach, ending its mask and vaccination mandates on May 1, which has caused fear and frustration among students. However, the University of Saskatchewan has seen over 400 positive cases of COVID-19 in the first two weeks of April, leading to a masking mandate until the end of June. Despite the rising sixth wave, more Ontario universities moved to end restrictions in early April, including the University of Guelph, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Carleton University, which had a recent outbreak of 221 cases. In contrast, Brock University has maintained its masking and vaccine measures, providing rapid antigen tests and masks to its community. Universities in Quebec have also seen outbreaks, with the Université Laval medical program and McGill University experiencing surges in cases. Quebec is seeing a rise in hospitalizations and infections following a two-month decline. The lifting of vaccine requirements and the end of masking mandates in universities across Canada may impact COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially with the ongoing sixth wave and high indicators of the virus in wastewater. It remains to be seen how these changes will affect the pandemic's trajectory and the safety of students and staff on campuses.

Publisher: First Nations Health Authority
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has entered its third year, and while we have gained knowledge about the virus, the long-term effects on those who have recovered from the initial infection are still being studied. Some people who have had COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms, often referred to as "long-COVID" or Post-COVID-19, which can last for months or years and significantly impact their quality of life. An estimated 2.5% to 10% of people who had COVID-19 may have symptoms for longer than three months, and these symptoms can vary in severity and sometimes worsen due to stress, leading to "flares." If individuals believe they are experiencing Post-COVID-19 symptoms, they should consult their healthcare provider, who may refer them to specialized clinics supporting COVID-19 recovery. Currently, resources are available to support recovery, including the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and medical transportation assistance. Understanding and managing Post-COVID-19 symptoms are crucial for both individuals and healthcare systems to ensure proper care and support are provided during recovery.

Title: Why COVID-19 and flu could be in a 'tug of war' in the years ahead
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The lifting of COVID-19 public health restrictions and increased travel are believed to have contributed to a late flu season in Canada, with a rise in Influenza A cases. This unusual flu activity may provide insights into how COVID-19 and influenza will interact in the future, with experts suggesting a possible "tug of war" between the two viruses. The behavior changes during the pandemic, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, successfully suppressed influenza cases, but the relaxation of these measures has led to a resurgence. Some experts attribute the suppression of influenza during the pandemic to "viral interference" by SARS-CoV-2, while others suggest that repeated COVID-19 waves may have left people immunocompromised, making them more susceptible to Influenza A. The short-term forecast predicts that both COVID-19 and influenza cases will decrease as the weather warms up, but there are concerns about another surge in the fall. Hospitals are already facing staffing shortages due to COVID-19, and experts emphasize the need for healthcare systems and governments to plan for the uncertain future, including encouraging Canadians to get vaccinated against both viruses. This article highlights the complex interplay between COVID-19 and influenza and the challenges faced by healthcare systems in managing these dual threats. It underscores the importance of continued surveillance, planning, and vaccination efforts to protect against severe illnesses and hospitalizations.
