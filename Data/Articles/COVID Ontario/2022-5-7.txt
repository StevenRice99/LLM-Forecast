The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting include: The current COVID-19 hospitalizations in some regions exceed figures from previous pandemic waves, with Niagara's main hospital ramping down surgeries to 70% and admitting 100 patients without a bed. The doctors' letter highlights the importance of masking in reducing COVID-19 infections and relieving hospital pressures. Ontario reported 32 more COVID-19 deaths and a day-over-day drop in hospitalizations, with a current total of 1,700 hospitalizations, which appears to be the peak according to Dr. Peter Juni. Dr. Juni expects a decline in wastewater indicators of COVID in the coming weeks, followed by a decrease in hospital admissions. These points suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario may have peaked and are expected to decline in the coming weeks, but masking and other public health measures are still crucial in reducing infections and hospitalizations, especially among vulnerable populations.
