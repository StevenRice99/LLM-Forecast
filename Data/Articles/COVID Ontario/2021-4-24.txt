Title: A Vaccination Strategy for Ontario COVID-19 Hotspots and Essential Workers
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The text describes a mathematical model used to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of vaccination strategies in Ontario, Canada. Here are the key points:
Model Inputs: 
Estimated reproductive rates and relative rates of cumulative and weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections between COVID-19 hotspots and lower-incidence areas
Contact rates and patterns by age-group based on the CONNECT study
Vaccination efficacy of 60% after one dose
Assumptions: 
Vaccination reduces acquisition of infection with an efficacy of 60%
The model captures direct and indirect benefits of vaccinations within hotspots and lower-incidence areas
The previous model assumes independence of hotspots and lower SARS-CoV-2 incidence neighborhoods, which may underestimate the impact of vaccination on one region
Simulation: 
Counterfactual scenarios were simulated to compare the base-case (no further COVID-19 vaccination beyond April 8, 2021) with a fixed amount of daily vaccinations (100,000 per day)
The hotspot-accelerated vaccination strategy allocated 50% of vaccines to the top 20% of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence neighborhoods and the remaining 50% equally across the province
The simulation compared the difference in infections averted, taking into account age-specific COVID-19 hospitalization, need for ICU, and mortality rates based on Ontario data
Results: 
Not explicitly stated, but presumably the model provides estimates of infections averted, hospitalizations prevented, and lives saved due to vaccination strategies.

Title: Nurse with northern roots sharing COVID-19 reality
Publisher: TimminsToday
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article features an interview with a nurse, Trudel, who shares her experiences and insights on caring for COVID-19 patients. Here are the main points discussed:
Lengthy reports: Trudel receives long reports about her patients, especially those with no known medical history. This makes it challenging to understand their condition.
Importance of paid sick days: She agrees that paid sick days would be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID-19 among coworkers and allowing people to isolate at home without financial stress.
Monitoring oxygen levels: Trudel believes that monitoring blood oxygen levels while patients are isolating at home can help prevent critical conditions. This could be achieved through regular check-ins by medical personnel or providing pulse oximeters for patients to use at home.
Long recoveries and complications: Survivors of severe COVID-19 cases often face long and difficult recoveries, especially if they require life support such as a heart and lung bypass machine. The nurse emphasizes that it's hard to predict patient outcomes in these situations.
Burnout among healthcare workers: Trudel notes that many healthcare workers are experiencing burnout due to the toll of caring for COVID-19 patients, including sacrificing time with their families and experiencing vicarious trauma.
Prevention is key: The nurse stresses that preventing community spread of COVID-19 is crucial. She encourages people to adhere to public health guidelines, such as social distancing, hand washing, and using hand sanitizer, to prevent the virus from spreading.
Overall, Trudel's experiences highlight the importance of prioritizing patient care, addressing burnout among healthcare workers, and taking proactive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Title: One of Ontario's top scientific advisers says he considered quitting after latest COVID-19 restrictions
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A top scientific adviser to the Ontario government suggests that paid sick leave is a crucial factor missing from new restrictions to control COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada mentioned in the article include:
Paid sick leave as a necessary measure to control the pandemic
Enhanced workplace inspections and increased sanitization to keep employees safe
Addressing social inequalities in public health measures
The importance of listening to scientific advice and having an open mind when making decisions about public health measures

Title: COVID-19 is 'not a joke': ICU staff at Cambridge Memorial Hospital brace for surge in patients
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized: 39 (in Waterloo region), with 13 in medicine unit and 8 in ICU at Cambridge Memorial Hospital
Total number of COVID-19 patients in ICU beds in Ontario: over 600 (according to Dr. Marhong)
Increasing hospitalizations and ICU admissions in the region, forcing local hospitals to accept patients from outside areas
Growing concern about running out of beds and ventilators, with plans to pull nurses from other areas to staff new critical-care beds

Article 6 of 7
Title: Strategies to Manage Tocilizumab Supply During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The text describes a plan for allocating tocilizumab, a medication used to treat COVID-19, when the demand exceeds the supply in Ontario. The plan involves using a simple unweighted lottery system to allocate the limited doses of the medication among eligible patients.
Here are the main points:
1. Optimizing dose: The recommended dose of tocilizumab is reduced from 800 mg to 400 mg for all patients.
2. Considering substitute: Sarilumab, another IL-6 inhibitor, can be considered as a substitute for tocilizumab when available.
3. Establishing dashboard: A provincial dashboard will track the supply and distribution of tocilizumab across Ontario.
4. Ongoing modeling: The demand-supply adequacy will be continuously monitored through modeling to ensure optimal use of the medication.
5. Centralized allocation lottery system: If the predicted demand exceeds the supply, a centralized allocation lottery system will be implemented as a default.
The plan also emphasizes the importance of ongoing evaluation and communication with stakeholders, including hospital administrators, healthcare providers, patients, and families, as well as the public.
Additionally, the text mentions that this approach can be adapted to test therapeutic hypotheses, such as comparing different doses of tocilizumab or evaluating other treatments for COVID-19.
