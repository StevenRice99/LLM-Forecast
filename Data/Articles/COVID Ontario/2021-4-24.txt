Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The article highlights the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage across Ontario, with neighborhoods having the highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection having the lowest rates of vaccination. The study suggests that accelerating vaccination of essential workers, their families, and other residents living in COVID-19 hotspots could substantially reduce the overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths in both younger and older Ontarians. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 14% reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations with the hotspot-accelerated vaccination strategy compared to the initial strategy. 14% reduction in COVID-19 ICU admissions with the hotspot-accelerated vaccination strategy compared to the initial strategy. 11% reduction in COVID-19 deaths with the hotspot-accelerated vaccination strategy compared to the initial strategy. 3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered over 30 days, with 50% allocated to hotspots and 50% distributed equally across the province. 37 vaccinations needed to prevent 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with the initial strategy, compared to 22 with the hotspot-accelerated strategy. These values can be used to inform forecasting models and estimate the potential impact of different vaccination strategies on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
