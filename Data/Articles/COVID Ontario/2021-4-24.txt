To protect British Columbia's healthcare system from COVID-19, the province has introduced travel restrictions to limit non-essential travel. The restrictions are in place from April 23 to May 25, 2021, and apply to everyone in the province, including non-essential travelers from outside. The restrictions divide the province into three regional zones: Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island, and Northern/Interior. People are advised to stay within their local communities and only travel for essential purposes. Essential travel includes attending school or work, transporting goods, accessing healthcare, or assisting someone in receiving healthcare. The goal of these restrictions is to reduce community transmission and support frontline healthcare workers as hospitalizations reach record levels due to new variant strains. The province is working with various organizations, such as the Ministry of Transportation, BC Ferries, tourism associations, and police departments, to ensure the restrictions are effective and enforce them through periodic road checks. Contraventions of the travel order may result in a $575 fine. These measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Title: A Vaccination Strategy for Ontario COVID-19 Hotspots and Essential Workers
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: In Ontario, COVID-19 hotspots, or neighborhoods with the highest infection rates, are also home to a large proportion of essential workers who cannot work remotely. As of April 5, 2021, only 15% of Ontarians had received a COVID-19 vaccine dose, and residents of hotspots and essential workers faced barriers to vaccination. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines protect against symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, reducing transmission risk. The article examines COVID-19 vaccination coverage, SARS-CoV-2 case rates, and the potential impact of accelerated vaccination for essential workers and hotspot residents. Findings reveal that neighborhoods with the highest infection risk had the lowest vaccination rates, and hotspots with more essential workers experienced higher infection rates. Modeling compares Ontario's initial age-based vaccination strategy with a strategy prioritizing hotspots and essential workers. The hotspot-accelerated strategy is projected to prevent more SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths, especially among younger and older adults. Accelerating vaccination for hotspot residents and essential workers could significantly reduce COVID-19 burden, but there are caveats to the analysis, including potential underestimation of the strategy's overall population benefits. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and other severe outcomes, the article presents a modeling scenario comparing Ontario's initial age-based vaccination strategy with a strategy prioritizing hotspots and essential workers. The hotspot-accelerated strategy is projected to prevent: An additional 14% of COVID-19 hospitalizations. An additional 14% of COVID-19 ICU admissions. An additional 11% of COVID-19 deaths among Ontarians aged 16 years and older. The model suggests that accelerating vaccination for hotspot residents and essential workers could significantly reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and other severe outcomes in Ontario.

The University of Victoria (UVic) has funded its first round of the Research Accelerator Fund (RAF) to support COVID-19 research and build more resilient communities. One project, led by Dr. Leigh Anne Swayne, focuses on understanding the adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain, including loss of smell and "brain fog." Another project, led by statistician Xuekui Zhang, involves studying risk factors for COVID-19 and forecasting infection counts by modeling US infection data and applying it to Canadian infection rates. Brianna Turner and Theone Paterson are leading a nationwide study on the impact of COVID-19 and preventative measures on Canadians' well-being, in collaboration with researchers in the UK. Other UVic research projects explore the mental health needs of older people and the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic with the overdose public health emergency in BC. Karen Urbanoski and Bernie Pauly are part of a team evaluating the rollout of "safer supply" prescribed alternatives to BC's toxic illicit drug supply, providing evidence to inform pandemic planning and emergency response. Karen Kobayashi leads a project on assisted living technologies (ALTs) for frail and vulnerable seniors to improve their health and quality of life. Claire Cutler's research identifies legal and political vulnerabilities in the supply chains for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in Canada and provides policy prescriptions for enhanced security.

Title: How has COVID-19 influenced the environment?
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False

Unfortunately, I cannot find any information in the provided text that can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, here is a summary of the text: The article explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the natural environment and wildlife. While the pandemic has had mostly negative consequences for humans, the reduction in human activity has had some positive effects on the natural world. Less travel means fewer wildlife deaths from road and air traffic, and a decrease in water travel reduces the risk of ships striking marine animals and disrupting their environment with noise pollution. The pandemic has also disrupted illegal supply chains that exploit and destroy wild populations. Furthermore, lockdowns have led to significant reductions in air and water pollution worldwide. However, the article also highlights some negative consequences of the pandemic for wildlife. The positive effects on wildlife are likely to be temporary and may reverse once human activity resumes. The pandemic has interrupted conservation efforts and reduced law enforcement, leading to a potential increase in illegal wildlife killing and exploitation of natural resources. Some species that rely on humans for food may be struggling, and increased human presence in parks and nature reserves during lockdowns may disturb resident wildlife. The pandemic has also led to an increase in plastic pollution from improperly disposed-of single-use protective gear, which is harmful to wildlife. Overall, the pandemic has had a mixed impact on the natural environment and wildlife, with some positive and negative effects. It remains to be seen whether any long-term benefits for the natural world will persist beyond the pandemic.

Title: Doug Ford’s flip-flops: A dangerous failure of risk communication in COVID-19 third wave
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 situation in Toronto, Ontario, is dire, with the province struggling to contain the spread of the virus and its variants. The author, a professor of disaster and emergency management, argues that the province's response to the pandemic has been characterized by confusion, mistrust, and inconsistent messaging, which has exacerbated the crisis. The closure and then quick reopening of outdoor playgrounds, and enhanced police powers to enforce stay-at-home orders, have been particularly controversial, with many experts and members of the public criticizing the government's handling of the situation. The author argues that effective risk communication is key to managing the pandemic, but that the province has failed to develop and communicate an informed plan to the public. This has led to a breakdown in trust and compliance with public health measures. The current situation in Ontario highlights the importance of clear and consistent pandemic risk communication from provincial leaders. Without it, the author warns, the public will lose trust in the messages and seek guidance elsewhere, making it even more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19.

Title: The inside story of Doug Ford's COVID-19 climbdowns
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Premier Doug Ford's decision to grant the police arbitrary powers and close playgrounds across Ontario was made in haste and without evidence that these measures would effectively curb the third wave of COVID-19. The choices were influenced by polling that indicated Ford's popularity was declining and the desire to demonstrate that he was taking action. The measures were not proposed by scientific or health advisors, and the cabinet has been divided between ministers from rural areas who oppose restrictions and those from the Greater Toronto Area advocating for stricter measures. The situation in hospitals is dire, with a record number of COVID-19 patients and ICU transfers, and Ford's approval ratings have dropped as the public becomes less satisfied with the pandemic response.

Title: Toronto's Latino community — 7 times more likely to contract COVID-19 than others — wants more support
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Toronto Public Health data reveals that members of the city's Latino community are nearly seven times more likely to contract COVID-19 and four times more likely to require hospitalization compared to their white counterparts. This disparity has significant implications as ICUs reach capacity. Factors contributing to these disparities include stress from racism, pre-existing health disparities, challenges accessing healthcare, and inability to follow public health guidelines due to essential worker status or overcrowded living conditions. Latin Americans represent 3% of Toronto's population but 8% of its COVID-19 cases. Toronto Public Health has been collecting race-based data on the pandemic's impact but acting on it remains a work in progress, especially in the provincial vaccine rollout. Language barriers and unclear communication about vaccine appointments further complicate the issue. The city is attempting to address these issues by allocating more resources to organizations serving impacted communities and offering translation services.

Title: Strategies to Manage Tocilizumab Supply During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: There is a shortage of the drug tocilizumab, which is used to treat COVID-19 patients and those with rheumatologic disorders. The shortage has led to hospitals rationing the drug in different ways, and there may be inequities in access depending on geography. The article provides findings and recommendations to optimize the dosing, distribution, and supply of tocilizumab to ensure the most benefit for COVID-19 patients. Key findings include pharmacokinetic data suggesting that alternate dosing strategies can conserve supply while providing therapeutic benefits, and the possibility of substituting tocilizumab with sarilumab, another IL-6 inhibitor. Recommendations include preserving tocilizumab for specific indications, following clinical practice guidelines, and allocating the drug province-wide to ensure equitable access. The article also provides options for managing the drug supply at all stages of the shortage and emphasizes the importance of clear communication to stakeholders. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and the potential impact on tocilizumab demand, the article suggests considering the following: The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and eligible for treatment with tocilizumab. The projected hospitalizations and ICU admissions based on disease modeling and surveillance data. The availability of real-time data on tocilizumab supply and utilization to identify potential shortfalls and plan accordingly. The impact of COVID-19 variants on hospitalization rates and the severity of illness, which may influence the demand for tocilizumab. The capacity of the healthcare system to manage the surge in hospitalizations and the ability to transfer patients if needed.
