Summary: The Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccination campaign aims to protect 75% of the population aged 12 and older. As of [date], over 25 million doses have been administered across Ontario. The province is focusing on boosting vaccination rates in underserved communities, with a goal of delivering vaccines directly to these areas. Ontario's contact tracing system has successfully isolated COVID-19 cases, preventing further transmission and reducing hospitalizations.
Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations:
Vaccination rate (75% target)
Number of vaccine doses administered (25 million+)
Targeted vaccination efforts in underserved communities
Effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation protocols

A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found a single dose of peginterferon lambda, an antiviral drug, reduced the risk of hospitalization or emergency department visit by 50% for high-risk patients with COVID-19. The benefits were seen across different variants, including Omicron.
Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Efficacy of peginterferon lambda against COVID-19, particularly among high-risk patients
Similar efficacy across different COVID-19 variants, including Omicron

Title: Interferon Injection Cuts COVID Hospitalization Risk in Vaxxed Population
Publisher: Medpage Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
A single dose of pegylated interferon lambda reduced the risk of hospitalization and ED visits lasting more than 6 hours in a highly vaccinated population.
Among nearly 2,000 participants with acute COVID symptoms and a risk factor for severe illness:
+ 2.7% of those who received pegylated interferon lambda required hospitalization or ED visits (vs 5.6% on placebo).
+ The treatment effect was consistent regardless of vaccination status.
The study found similar results across different variants, including Delta and Omicron.
Note: This article suggests that early treatment with pegylated interferon lambda may be effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 patients, which is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses a Public Health Ontario (PHO) science brief that analyzed the effectiveness of mask mandates in reducing COVID-19 transmission.
Key findings:
+ Mask mandates were associated with lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no clear evidence on their effectiveness in reducing influenza and RSV transmission.
+ There was limited evidence to suggest greater effectiveness of mask mandates compared to recommendations for reducing COVID-19 case rate reduction.
+ A poll found 53% of respondents agreed that a mask mandate should be re-implemented in Ontario.
