TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article discusses a clinical trial of PEG-lambda, a drug that has shown promise in reducing hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The trial took place in Brazil and Canada, including 5 sites in Canada. The study found that patients treated with PEG-lambda experienced a 51% reduction in hospitalization relative to placebo, and an 89% reduction in unvaccinated patients treated within the first three days of symptom onset. The drug was equally effective against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron. The study also found that vaccinated patients treated with PEG-lambda experienced a 58% reduction in hospitalization relative to placebo. These findings suggest that PEG-lambda may be an effective treatment for reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly among unvaccinated individuals and those treated early in the course of their illness.

TRUE. This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study found that early treatment with pegylated interferon lambda decreased the risk of hospitalization and emergency department visits in a highly vaccinated population of COVID-19 outpatients. The results showed that 2.7% of those who received pegylated interferon lambda required hospitalization or ED visits, compared to 5.6% of those given a placebo. The treatment effect was more pronounced in those who received the injection within 3 days of their symptoms. The study was conducted primarily in Brazil, but the results were consistent across strains, including Delta and Omicron. The article highlights the potential of pegylated interferon lambda as a treatment for COVID-19, which could impact hospitalization rates in Ontario, Canada. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 2.7% hospitalization rate for those who received pegylated interferon lambda 5.6% hospitalization rate for those who received a placebo Treatment effect more pronounced when injection was given within 3 days of symptoms Results consistent across strains, including Delta and Omicron Study population was highly vaccinated (over 80%) Median age of participants was 43 years, and 57% were women Most participants had multiple comorbidities (nearly 60%)

Title: Masking may not have eased respiratory virus surge in the fall: PHO document
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the effectiveness of mask mandates in reducing the transmission of COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Ontario, particularly among children and youth. The Public Health Ontario science brief concludes that while masking has strong effects on reducing COVID-19 transmission, the benefits of mask mandates are less clear when multiple respiratory viruses are circulating. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: The article mentions a surge in pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, which led to historic volumes in intensive care units and emergency departments. The brief notes that mask mandates may not have produced more of a benefit than recommendations in reducing transmission. The article cites a Public Health Ontario synthesis of research in March 2022, which found positive effects of mask mandates in the community setting and reductions in COVID-19 case growth, hospitalizations, and deaths. The brief also references polling data showing public support for mask mandates, with 53% of respondents agreeing that a mask mandate should be re-implemented in Ontario. These values suggest that while mask mandates may have some effect on reducing COVID-19 transmission, their impact on hospitalizations is uncertain, particularly when multiple respiratory viruses are circulating. This information can be used to inform forecasting models and predict the potential impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
