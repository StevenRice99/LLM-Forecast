TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: British Columbia (BC) is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, particularly among children under 11, with 17% of infections in this age group. The infection rate for kids under 10 is the highest per capita for any age group in BC, with a 73% increase in cases among unvaccinated kids aged 5-9 between school opening and the end of September. The hospitalization rate for children under 10 is about 2%, with a higher rate for children under 5 (1.7%) compared to children aged 5-11 (0.3%). The article suggests that BC's pandemic management policy for schools may have been too cautious and reactive, rather than aggressively proactive, which may have contributed to the surge in cases. Ontario, on the other hand, has seen a decline in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, with a full mask mandate and specialized air filtration units in every classroom. The article highlights the importance of vaccination, with 81% of BC's population fully vaccinated, but notes that children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination, leaving them vulnerable to infection. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the spread of the virus among different age groups, the effectiveness of different pandemic management policies, and the impact of vaccination on hospitalization rates.

TRUE. This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The delta variant is associated with a 108% increased risk of hospitalization, 235% increased risk of ICU admission, and 133% increased risk of death compared to the original virus strain. The study analyzed over 212,000 cases of COVID-19 in Ontario between February 7 and June 27, providing a large dataset for understanding the impact of the delta variant. The findings suggest that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe disease and death, with unvaccinated individuals making up the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. As of September 25, just over 80% of those eligible were fully vaccinated, leaving a significant portion of the population at risk. The article mentions the potential for a "bump" in case numbers after Thanksgiving, which could be an important factor to consider in forecasting hospitalizations. These values can be used to inform forecasting models, particularly in understanding the impact of the delta variant and the importance of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations and deaths.
