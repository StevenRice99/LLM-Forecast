Title: Doctor who says he gave ivermectin to rural Alberta COVID-19 patients prompts warning from health authority
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
A Vancouver-based doctor, Dr. Daniel Nagase, claimed he treated three COVID-19 patients with ivermectin, a drug typically used to rid livestock of parasites, at a rural hospital in Rimbey, Alberta. This has prompted a response from Alberta Health Services (AHS), which stated that ivermectin is not approved for treating or preventing COVID-19 and that its misuse can pose serious health risks. Dr. Nagase's actions have been criticized by other medical professionals, including Dr. Keith Wolstenholme, who called it "dangerous" and a form of misinformation that undermines trusted medical science. The article also notes that ivermectin has been wrongly promoted as a cure for COVID-19, leading to shortages for those who need it for approved parasite-related illnesses. Health Canada and Alberta's poison hotline have both issued advisories against using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 due to its potential health risks. While Dr. Nagase claims the drug worked quickly on the patients, AHS states that there is no conclusive data supporting ivermectin's effectiveness against COVID-19.

Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the results of a survey conducted in Ontario, Canada, to understand the confidence in COVID-19 vaccines among its residents. The survey received responses from 28,660 Ontarians between December 2020 and June 2021. Overall, vaccine confidence remained relatively stable during this period, ranging from 72% to 79%. However, there were specific groups with lower vaccine confidence. These groups included individuals with lower household incomes, those unable to work from home, and those self-identifying as racialized (non-white European). The survey data also revealed demographic and regional associations with COVID-19 vaccine confidence. Lower vaccine confidence was associated with lower household incomes, a higher number of people working outside the home, and residing in regions with higher COVID-19 case rates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a statistically significant decrease in vaccine confidence among these groups. The article highlights the importance of understanding the factors contributing to lower vaccine confidence in these communities. It mentions the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infections and severe outcomes among racialized and low-income communities in Ontario. To address this, community-level strategies, outreach, and interventions are recommended, including engagement with local leaders and partnerships with trusted individuals and organizations. The Black Scientists' Taskforce on Vaccine Equity is presented as a case study to demonstrate effective community-specific interventions. They conducted weekly town halls to understand vaccine hesitancy in the Black community and addressed historical mistrust in healthcare institutions and government, concerns about vaccine safety, and experiences with anti-Black racism. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to support those with lower vaccine confidence and provides specific suggestions for community leaders to increase vaccine uptake in these groups. It highlights the importance of increasing capability, opportunity, and motivation to get vaccinated through community-tailored engagement and addressing historical and societal factors that drive mistrust. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, factors such as vaccination rates, effectiveness of vaccines against severe disease, and transmission rates in the community should be considered. The article mentions that lower vaccine confidence is associated with certain demographic groups, which could impact hospitalization rates if they have lower vaccination coverage. Additionally, ongoing surveillance of infection rates and monitoring for new variants can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Burnout, a significant occupational hazard in healthcare, has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional fulfillment. Pre-pandemic, burnout rates among healthcare workers ranged from 20-50%, with nurses and physicians in hospital settings experiencing severe burnout at rates of 20-40%. Risk factors for burnout include heavy workload, long hours, role conflicts, moral distress, interpersonal conflicts, violence, and inadequate documentation systems. Conversely, protective factors include supportive leadership, manager support, autonomy, scheduling flexibility, and self-efficacy. During the pandemic, risk factors for burnout have intensified due to increased patient acuity, staffing shortages, overtime, and moral distress. Additionally, healthcare workers face unique challenges like health risks and uncertainty about infectious precautions, further contributing to burnout. Early in the pandemic, studies from Italy and Belgium reported severe emotional exhaustion among hospital workers, with rates similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, as the pandemic progressed, burnout rates escalated, reaching 51% in Canada and 76% in the US by late 2020. Interventions targeting modifiable mediators of burnout are crucial. These include improving staffing ratios, providing mental health support, enhancing workplace safety, promoting teamwork, and addressing systemic issues. Addressing burnout is essential to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and maintain the integrity of the healthcare system. Future research should focus on evaluating interventions and their effectiveness in mitigating burnout among hospital-based healthcare workers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 leaves a legacy of rising poverty and widening inequality
Publisher: World Bank
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global inequality and poverty. While the full effects cannot be quantified yet, simulations suggest that even a minor increase in within-country inequality could significantly increase the number of people living in poverty and widen the income growth gap between the bottom and top 40 percent. The pandemic's impact on income loss, asset erosion, food insecurity, and education will also have long-term effects on social mobility and inequality. Job losses among vulnerable groups and the severe impact on small businesses can hinder economic recovery and persist even as economies improve. To tackle these issues and accelerate economic recovery in lowand lower-middle-income countries, the following steps are necessary: Increase the supply of COVID-19 vaccines to these countries to improve vaccination rates and remove obstacles to growth. Expand fiscal space and promote fair and efficient domestic resource mobilization to support investments for inclusive growth. Implement targeted spending and policies to support women, low-skilled workers, and urban informal sector workers, ensuring equal access to financial services and technology, and strengthening safety nets and social insurance. Support children and parents through policies as schools reopen. Addressing structural inequalities today is crucial to building resilient societies capable of withstanding future crises. While this summary does not directly provide forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations, the discussed factors could indirectly influence healthcare capacity and access in affected regions.

Title: The Long History of mRNA Vaccines
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The history of mRNA vaccines dates back to the 1960s when mRNA was first discovered, and research began on how to deliver it into cells in the 1970s. However, it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that the first mRNA vaccine was brought to market. The early years of mRNA research faced challenges due to the quick degradation of mRNA before it could be translated into proteins in cells. This challenge was overcome through the development of nanotechnology, creating fatty droplets (lipid nanoparticles) that protected the mRNA and allowed it to enter cells effectively. The first mRNA vaccines were developed against Ebola, but the virus's limited presence hindered commercial development in the US. With the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccine technology finally had its moment, proving safe and effective, with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine becoming the first mRNA product fully approved by the FDA. Now, vaccine manufacturers are exploring mRNA vaccines for other respiratory viruses and even HIV, marking a new era for vaccine technology and production.

Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a clinical case definition for post-COVID-19 conditions, which is applicable worldwide. This definition was created through a Delphi methodology, involving patients, researchers, and representatives from all WHO regions. Post-COVID-19 condition is characterized by a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms usually appearing 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 and lasting for at least 2 months. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, which impact daily functioning. These symptoms may be new or persist from the initial COVID-19 episode, and they may fluctuate or relapse over time. This definition is subject to change as our understanding of COVID-19 evolves and new evidence emerges.

Canadian military nurses have been deployed to Edmonton, Alberta, to help with the overwhelming number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, particularly in the critical care unit. As of Wednesday, there were 1,094 hospitalizations and 252 admissions in the ICU due to COVID-19 in Alberta, with the "vast majority" being COVID patients, according to Alberta Health Services. The province has had to add hundreds of ICU beds to cope, and the current capacity is at 82%. Without the additional surge ICU beds, capacity would be at 177%. The military support is expected to last until the end of October. To reduce the spread, new measures have been implemented, including reducing outdoor gathering limits and offering a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to eligible individuals.

Title: How Canada compares to welfare states in COVID-19 cases and deaths
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article compares COVID-19 cases and mortality rates across different welfare state models: liberal, social democratic, and conservative. While there were no significant differences between the three models, there was variation within the liberal state group, with some countries experiencing higher numbers of infections and mortality rates than others. The analysis includes data from subsequent waves of the pandemic and finds that Canada, a liberal state, has generally fared better than some other liberal states like the US and UK, but worse than Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan. The high vaccination rates in Canada, coupled with trust in public health institutions, have helped curb the pandemic. However, outbreaks in long-term care facilities and the agri-food industry have contributed to higher infection and mortality rates. The UK's high number of cases in the third wave is attributed to the Delta variant, while Ireland's high numbers are linked to holiday gatherings and the Alpha variant. The US has higher vaccine hesitancy, impacting its numbers. Overall, the article suggests that welfare regimes and public health policies significantly impact COVID-19 outcomes, with more equitable and well-resourced public sectors associated with lower mortality rates.

Title: U of T research may help explain children's immune response to COVID-19
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the University of Toronto have discovered that immune cells from children's upper respiratory tracts, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, react to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This finding offers a potential explanation for why COVID-19 symptoms in children tend to be mild or non-existent, while adults often experience severe illness or death. The study, published in the Journal of Immunology, found that B cells from tonsil tissues of children reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Additionally, antibodies generated from these B cells showed neutralizing potential against the virus in laboratory experiments, hindering the spike protein's ability to bind to cell surface target proteins. The researchers initially believed that the B cells reacted to SARS-CoV-2 due to previous encounters with similar coronaviruses responsible for common colds. However, further testing revealed that the antibodies did not react to those coronaviruses, despite sharing some genetic sequence characteristics. The findings suggest cross-reactivity in the B-cell antibodies, where the immune system produces antibodies that react to SARS-CoV-2 as a byproduct of responding to other triggers. A better understanding of this antibody reaction could help elucidate the varying susceptibility to COVID-19 in children and adults, guiding clinical and public health decisions. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells in all tested samples, including 'naïve' B cells that had not encountered any pathogens, suggests that the cause may be related to common elements in the childhood environment or microbiome. The study also utilized computational biology to predict antibody reactions and benefited from collaborations with researchers from various fields and institutions, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of COVID-19 research. The findings suggest that children should respond well to vaccines, as they possess naïve B cells capable of recognizing vaccine components. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the mucosal immune system's role in COVID-19 and could have implications for therapeutic approaches and public health strategies.
