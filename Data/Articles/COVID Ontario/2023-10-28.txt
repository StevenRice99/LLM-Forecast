1.3 million Canadians left ERs without being seen in the 2022-2023 year.
This is a 34% increase from the previous year (963,000).
The ER visit rate was 15.1 million patients, with 8.6% leaving without medical care.
ER overcrowding and long wait times may lead to increased hospitalization rates due to untreated conditions.
