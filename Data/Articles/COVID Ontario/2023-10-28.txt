The study published in PLOS One highlights that people recently incarcerated in Ontario, Canada, were at an increased risk of opioid-related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of death due to opioid toxicity increased for the general population in Ontario at the pandemic's start but was significantly higher for those with a history of incarceration, rising by up to 50% from 2015-2020. This trend was more pronounced for men, with COVID-19 increasing their already elevated risk by 1.5 times, while the risk for women increased by 1.2 times. The study also revealed that individuals aged 25-49 who had been incarcerated were the most affected. Several factors contributed to the rise in drug-related deaths during the pandemic, including increased stress, social isolation, and worsening mental health. Additionally, pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for drug-dependent individuals to access safer consumption sites and support services. To reduce drug-related deaths, the researchers recommend implementing more training and resources for this vulnerable population, improving access to evidence-based treatment, and addressing the toxic drug supply. The findings underscore the need to explicitly include prison settings and the unique needs of the incarcerated and recently released individuals in pandemic preparedness and response plans. This population faces significant challenges during transitions from prison to the community, including discontinuity of healthcare, housing instability, and difficulty accessing essential services. While the study focuses on Ontario, the researchers expect similar trends in other provinces like British Columbia, emphasizing the widespread impact of the overlapping public health emergencies on this vulnerable population.

Researchers from the University of Alberta have developed a predictive model to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and identify patients at risk of developing long COVID. The model, composed of 20 molecules, predicted adverse clinical outcomes with 83% accuracy. The study involved analyzing blood samples from 117 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Alberta, 55 of whom developed long COVID with three or more symptoms persisting for at least 18 months. The researchers identified lower plasma levels of the amino acid taurine as a key marker of more severe and prolonged symptoms, increased hospitalization, and higher mortality risk. Further clinical trials are needed to validate the effectiveness of taurine supplementation in reducing long COVID symptoms, but initial studies show promising results and no harmful side effects. The team is also working on validating their predictive test on a larger, more diverse population. This research could lead to better treatments and tests for long COVID patients in the future.

Publisher: Temerty Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the University of Toronto and partner hospitals have created a database that may help explain why some individuals experience more severe cases of COVID-19 than others. Led by Lisa Strug, a senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children, the team recognized the potential genetic component influencing the severity of COVID-19 infections, given the role genes played in previous SARS infections. Through collaboration with nearly 100 researchers across various institutions in Canada, the team sequenced the genomes of individuals with COVID-19, resulting in the CGEn HostSeq database, also known as the Canadian COVID-19 Human Host Genome Sequencing Databank. This project was funded by a $20 million grant. The database gathered over 11,000 full genome sequences from across Canada, representing a diverse range of health outcomes. This data was combined with sequences from international patients under the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Initial findings identified 13 genome-wide significant loci associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 cases. Further analysis has since confirmed these loci and identified additional ones, with the latest update bringing the total to 51 distinct loci. The identification of these loci can help predict individuals who may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 and also uncover therapeutic targets for potential drug development. The database has broader applications beyond COVID-19 research, and the team highlights its potential as a long-term national whole-genome sequencing resource for various health and genetic inquiries. The article concludes by emphasizing the collaborative nature of the project and its significance as a valuable data resource for future research endeavors.

Title: COVID-19 passports did little to convince people to get vaccinated in Quebec, Ontario: study
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a study that examined the impact of vaccine passports on vaccination rates and reducing inequalities in vaccine coverage in Quebec and Ontario, Canada. Here are the key points and important facts from the article: Vaccine passports in Quebec and Ontario had a minimal impact on convincing the unvaccinated to get vaccinated, resulting in a 0.9% and 0.7% increase in vaccination rates, respectively. The study found that low-income neighborhoods in both provinces tended to have higher rates of COVID-19 and lower vaccine coverage. Areas with large racialized populations in Quebec also had lower vaccination rates. The vaccine passports did not significantly reduce inequalities in vaccination coverage between wealthy and low-income areas, or between racialized and non-racialized populations. The passports were introduced in all provinces and Yukon in 2021 to avoid lockdowns and increase vaccination rates, but they were discontinued by spring 2022. Researchers simulated vaccine uptake trends to determine the direct impact of vaccine passports, concluding that they had a small effect on overall vaccine uptake. The impact of vaccine passports may have been muted due to already high vaccination rates, with over 82% of eligible residents vaccinated before the passports were announced. Understanding the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy is crucial for increasing vaccination rates, as different groups may have different concerns or barriers. The study found that vaccine passports led to a slightly larger increase in vaccination rates among young people, especially those aged 12 to 17, who had the lowest vaccination rates. The passports had the smallest effect on people over 60, who already had the highest vaccination rates. In Quebec, vaccine passports slightly increased coverage in low-income areas compared to wealthier areas, but the difference was small. In Ontario, the increase was similar across all income groups. The study found no clear trend in Quebec regarding racialized populations but saw a small increase in Ontario. Overall, the study suggests that vaccine passports had a limited impact on convincing the unvaccinated to get vaccinated and reducing inequalities in vaccine coverage. It highlights the importance of understanding the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy and implementing targeted strategies to reach hesitant or underserved groups.

Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article focuses on the potential link between COVID-19 and fungal dysbiosis, particularly in the gut mycobiome. Here is a summary of the key points: COVID-19 has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, including changes in the fungal community (mycobiome). The gut mycobiome plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining gut health. COVID-19 patients exhibit changes in their gut mycobiome composition, with an increase in opportunistic pathogens and a decrease in beneficial fungi. Fungal dysbiosis in COVID-19 may contribute to the excessive inflammatory response and immune dysfunction observed in severe cases. The restoration of a healthy gut mycobiome could be a potential therapeutic target for managing COVID-19 and preventing long-term complications. The article also highlights the potential risk of fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with severe disease or those who are immunocompromised. The role of the gut-lung axis in COVID-19 is discussed, including the potential impact of gut mycobiome alterations on respiratory fungal infections. The authors emphasize the need for further research to fully understand the complex interactions between COVID-19, the gut mycobiome, and the immune system. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered: Surveillance and monitoring: Tracking cases, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions can help identify trends and predict future needs. The COVID-19 Dashboard by Johns Hopkins University provides valuable data for this purpose. Viral variants: Emerging variants can impact transmissibility, severity, and immune evasion, influencing hospitalization rates. Healthcare capacity: The availability of healthcare resources, including ICU beds and ventilators, is a critical factor in managing COVID-19 hospitalizations. Vaccination rates: Vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization. Monitoring vaccination coverage and effectiveness can help forecast healthcare demands. Therapeutic options: The availability and effectiveness of treatments, such as remdesivir and tocilizumab, can impact hospitalization rates and outcomes. Seasonal variations: COVID-19 hospitalizations may fluctuate with seasonal changes, with potential increases during winter months. Co-infections: As discussed in the article, fungal co-infections or secondary infections can complicate COVID-19, leading to increased hospitalizations. Social and behavioral factors: Adherence to public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, can influence transmission rates and hospitalizations. By considering these factors and utilizing data from sources like the COVID-19 Dashboard, healthcare professionals and public health authorities can make informed predictions about COVID-19 hospitalizations and allocate resources accordingly.

Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article reflects on the past responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly regarding youth experiences during school closures and re-openings, to improve future responses to the ongoing pandemic and potential new diseases. The research highlights the importance of communication and meaningful discussions with youth, as their voices and perspectives should be included and taken seriously in decisions that impact their lives. One key finding is that youth felt left out of pandemic-related decision-making, particularly around school closures and formats. They experienced a lack of direct communication, which led to confusion and oversight. The article quotes a student named Jeanne, who wished for direct communication about school closures, and Hamza, who felt that youth were not given a chance to participate in decision-making. Another critical finding addresses the decline in youth mental health during the pandemic, with most students experiencing negative emotions and challenges to their independence. Students like Drew from Ontario struggled to find mental health support and navigate the system. Some students had trusted adults to confide in, but others faced barriers such as confidentiality concerns, limited knowledge of available resources, and lack of specialized staff in schools. The article emphasizes the need to prioritize meaningful youth engagement in decision-making, as it can lead to more effective policies and services. It suggests providing youth with accurate information through easily accessible spaces like social media or schools. The overwhelming recommendation from youth to adults is to communicate and discuss matters that affect them. This engagement is not just a suggestion but a right protected by international law. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or predictions. However, it highlights the ongoing impact of the pandemic on youth mental health and the need for improved support and communication. Forecasting hospitalizations may depend on various factors, including infection rates, vaccination status, and the emergence of new variants.
