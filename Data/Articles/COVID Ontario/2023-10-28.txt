The latest Omicron subvariants EG.5 and XBB are now present and infecting cases in southern Ontario and across Canada. Active cases Canada-wide have surpassed 600,000 people, with national hospitalizations and deaths increasing at concerning rates.

Title: Updated COVID-19 Boosters and XBB.1.5: What You Need to Know
Publisher: American Society for Microbiology
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the US occur among older adults (65 years), with 63% of hospitalizations occurring in this age group from Jan-Aug 2023. Only 23.5% of hospitalized individuals in the US had received the recommended COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, and only 58.6% had received the original vaccines. The updated COVID-19 vaccine is a monovalent version, targeting the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, which is expected to provide protection against currently circulating variants. The vaccine is approved for everyone ages 6 months and older, and an analysis by the CDC suggests that universal vaccination could prevent 400,000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths in the US over the next 2 years. The COVID-19 vaccine can be administered with other seasonal vaccinations, such as the flu vaccine. Individuals who recently had a COVID-19 infection may wait up to 3 months before being vaccinated, but staying up to date on vaccination is important to prevent re-infection. These values can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly with regards to the impact of vaccination rates and the circulation of new variants on hospitalization rates among older adults.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: Public Health Ontario's latest COVID-19 wastewater data shows an uptick of the virus in most parts of the province, including the Greater Toronto Area, indicating a potential increase in cases. A recent Toronto Board of Health report suggests that the city will experience a high level of respiratory virus activity, with data from the southern hemisphere (e.g., Australia) showing an early start to the season and higher-than-average hospitalizations, especially among children. Health officials are anticipating a "surge" of infections through the fall and are encouraging vaccination, with updated Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Spikevax vaccines offering better protection against severe infection from currently circulating variants. These points suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, and highlight the importance of vaccination and other preventive measures to mitigate this risk.

Title: More than 1.3 M Canadians abandoned waits in emergency rooms in 2023
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of Canadians leaving hospital emergency rooms without being seen increased by 34% from 2021-2022 to 2022-2023, with 1.3 million Canadians leaving ERs without care in the 2022-2023 year. This represents 8.6% of the 15.1 million Canadians who sought care in emergency units, an increase from 6.8% in 2021-2022. The overcrowding and long wait times in ERs may lead to patients leaving without being seen, which can result in severe consequences, including death. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that the healthcare system is experiencing capacity issues, which could impact the ability to handle a surge in COVID-19 cases. Additionally, the overcrowding and long wait times in ERs may lead to increased transmission of COVID-19 among patients and healthcare workers, further exacerbating the pandemic.
