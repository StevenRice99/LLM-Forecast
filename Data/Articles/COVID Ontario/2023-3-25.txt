Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Hospitalization rates are stable but above 100% capacity at some hospitals, including Hamilton Health Sciences (111% of funded beds) and McMaster Children's Hospital.
Only 67 patients with COVID-19 were reported at HHS as of Wednesday, with "less than" five in intensive care.
Public health officials recommend staying up-to-date on boosters, especially for those over 60 or with underlying conditions, but only 20% have had a booster in the last six months.
