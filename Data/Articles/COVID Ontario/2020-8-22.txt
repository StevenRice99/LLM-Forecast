Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article provides information on COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and self-isolation guidelines in Nova Scotia, Canada. Here are the key points: Nova Scotia Health Authority is the go-to source for information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. They also provide guidance for those who have tested positive. Testing is available throughout the province, and individuals should refer to the testing requirements to know when and how to get tested. Most people do not need to self-isolate, but it is recommended for those with COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test result. Self-isolation involves staying at home and avoiding contact with others to prevent the spread of the virus. Self-isolation guidelines include staying at home, avoiding public places, and minimizing contact with others. This includes using separate living spaces and disinfecting shared surfaces. Individuals should wear a mask in common areas if self-isolating in a shared building and should avoid leaving the property except for essential reasons or outdoor exercise while maintaining physical distance. Other recommendations during self-isolation include daily temperature checks, having supplies delivered, avoiding contact with vulnerable individuals, and following hygiene and cleaning practices. The Government of Canada also provides resources and support for individuals who are self-isolating or caring for someone with COVID-19. These guidelines are important to follow to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and prevent hospitalizations. By identifying symptoms early through testing and self-isolating when necessary, individuals can play a crucial role in protecting their own health and the health of their community.

Title: Long-Haulers Are Redefining COVID-19
Publisher: The Atlantic
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the experiences of individuals known as "long-haulers" who have been suffering from lingering symptoms of COVID-19 for months. These long-haulers, including Lauren Nichols, have faced a range of debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, memory loss, and more, long after their initial infection. Many long-haulers are young and previously healthy individuals, challenging the notion that COVID-19 primarily affects older individuals with preexisting conditions. The article highlights the challenges faced by long-haulers in receiving recognition, support, and appropriate medical care. Many long-haulers have had to form their own support groups, conduct research, and advocate for recognition of their condition. Some studies have shown lingering damage from COVID-19, with a significant percentage of patients experiencing symptoms for months after their initial infection. The lack of clear information and recognition from official sources has led many long-haulers to seek answers and support from each other through online groups. Medical professionals like Dr. David Putrino have started programs to care for long-haulers, but such programs are still limited in availability. The article also discusses the connection between long-haulers' symptoms and conditions like dysautonomia and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome). Overall, the article sheds light on the challenges faced by long-haulers, the need for more research and support for their condition, and the importance of listening to and believing the experiences of these individuals to provide appropriate care and understanding.

Title: Manitoba unveils 'flexible' colour-coded COVID-19 response system
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Manitoba has unveiled a new colour-coded system to guide its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with four risk levels: green ("limited risk"), yellow ("caution"), orange ("restricted"), and red ("critical"). This system will allow the government to implement restrictions more flexibly and responsively, targeting specific regions, communities, sectors, or sites, rather than applying blanket restrictions across the entire province. The province is currently at the yellow level, indicating low levels of community transmission, but with some restrictions already in place, such as limits on gathering sizes and travel. Health officials will consider multiple factors when determining whether to increase or ease restrictions, including test positivity rates, increases in case numbers, and the ability to trace and contain new clusters. This system aims to balance public health needs with economic concerns, allowing Manitoba to "live with [the] virus without requiring widespread shutdowns."

Title: Why is COVID-19 prompting questions about Proposition 65?
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses how sales of vacuum cleaners, air filters, and cordless hair clippers have increased due to concerns about reducing the transmission of COVID-19. However, the main focus of the article is not the coronavirus itself, but California's Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide warnings about chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive harm. The author argues that Proposition 65 is based on content rather than exposure, and that the warnings are unnecessary and may even cause unnecessary stress, which is a risk factor for disease. The law has led to products containing certain chemicals, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) insulation in electrical wires, being labeled with warnings about the presence of chemicals that may cause cancer or reproductive harm, even when the amounts are trace and deemed safe by other regulatory agencies. Cancer incidence in California has not significantly decreased compared to other states since the law was enacted over thirty-five years ago, except for smoking-related cancers. The author suggests that instead of focusing on Proposition 65, California legislators should pass laws to enforce mask-wearing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider various factors such as vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, social distancing measures, and the availability of healthcare resources. While Proposition 65 is not directly related to COVID-19 hospitalizations, the author's argument about the importance of focusing on effective public health measures, such as mask-wearing, is relevant to controlling the spread of the virus and reducing hospitalizations.

Title: Why maps matter in our response to COVID-19
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: Mapping the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Power of Data Visualizations Summary: Maps and data visualizations have been crucial in understanding, responding to, and recovering from the COVID-19 crisis. The well-known Johns Hopkins University map, with its alarming red and black display, tracks COVID-19 infections and deaths in nearly 190 countries in real time. Other prominent dashboards include those by the World Health Organization (WHO), GAVI, and HealthMap, offering country-specific updates and detailed information. Companies like Carto, ESRI, and MapBox have developed tools to help governments, businesses, and health agencies respond to the pandemic. Citizen-led initiatives and groups are also utilizing these tools to access infection risks and develop open-source resources. Efforts to capture misinformation and understand public sentiment include platforms like the Infodemic Observatory and GDELT, which track social media messages and news coverage. Several maps predict COVID-19 spread using computational methods, while platforms like COVID Near You and Facebook's anonymized data help track symptoms and physical distancing efforts. The University of Oxford's government response tracker monitors containment, closure, and policy metrics, providing insights into government actions. Groups like COVIDCareMap and ESRI offer detailed open-source data on health capacities, while MapBox provides telemetry data on mobility patterns. Organizations are also mapping the social and economic impacts, including job losses and school disruptions, to understand the comprehensive effects of the pandemic. Research groups like UrbanFootprint are combining methods to help planners respond to COVID-19, including estimating risks, predicting sector impacts, and guiding health authority decisions. Despite the abundance of real-time maps, critical gaps remain, especially in accessing basic geospatial information in many regions like Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. To address this, the SecDev Group is designing a data-driven platform specifically for local governments and health providers in lowerand middle-income settings to improve data-driven prevention and response.

Title: Nine COVID-19 Myths That Just Won't Go Away
Publisher: Scientific American
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, focusing on important facts that can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the spread of misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, referring to it as an "infodemic." It identifies and debunks several myths about the virus, providing evidence-based explanations to correct misleading or false information. Myth 1: The novel coronavirus was engineered in a lab in China. US intelligence agencies and virologists have denied this claim, stating that the scientific consensus is that COVID-19 was not man-made or genetically modified. Myth 2: N/A Myth 3: COVID-19 is no worse than the flu. Epidemiologists suspect that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is far higher than that of the flu. As of the writing of the article, COVID-19 had caused more than 191,000 deaths in the US, compared to an estimated 12,000 to 61,000 flu-related deaths per year. Many people have partial immunity to the flu due to vaccination or prior infection, whereas most people have not yet been exposed to COVID-19. Myth 4: You don’t need to wear a mask. There is a strong consensus among public health authorities that wearing a face mask can limit the transmission of COVID-19 through exhaled droplets. Cloth face masks are an effective alternative when N95 and surgical masks are not available. Myth 5: Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment. Despite initial hopes, growing evidence shows that hydroxychloroquine does not benefit COVID-19 patients and may cause heart problems. Myth 6: N/A Myth 7: Spikes in cases are because of increased testing. Analyses have shown that the rate of positive tests has risen in states with large outbreaks and decreased in states that have controlled their outbreaks. This indicates that the increase in cases is not just due to increased testing but reflects a true rise in infections. Myth 8: N/A Myth 9: Any vaccine will be unsafe and a bigger risk than getting COVID-19. While there is a need for caution regarding new vaccines, the leading vaccine candidates are undergoing large-scale clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy. A recent Gallup poll found that one-third of Americans would not get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today, which could hinder efforts to control the virus. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of accurate information and the potential consequences of misinformation, including the impact on public health and safety. This summary includes several key facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 mortality rate is suspected to be higher than that of the flu. Face masks are effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Increased testing does not solely account for spikes in cases, indicating a true increase in infections. A significant portion of the population may refuse vaccination, which could influence the spread of the virus and the demand for healthcare services.

Title: How are cancer patients cared for during COVID-19? U of T's Fei-Fei Lu on the changes at Princess Margaret
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer care has been significantly impacted, and the way radiation therapy is delivered to patients has changed. To reduce patients' exposure to hospital settings, especially for older patients, radiation oncologists have shortened treatment regimens from the traditional five weeks to three weeks or even one week in some cases. This change has been made possible by emerging research indicating that shorter radiation regimens can be safe and effective. As a result, cancer centers like the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre have rapidly adapted to this new approach to ensure the safest and highest-quality radiation care for their patients. The pandemic has also led to the deferral of radiation and other treatments for cancer patients to limit their visits to the hospital. However, cancer care providers must carefully balance the need for deferral with the optimal timeframe for treatment to ensure the best clinical outcomes. Virtual care has been widely adopted, with approximately 50% of clinic activities being conducted virtually using platforms like the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN). While virtual care has benefits, it cannot replace all aspects of in-person care, especially for new patients who may struggle to build trust with their physicians without face-to-face interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted health disparities, with data showing that specific populations, particularly those economically disadvantaged, are more affected by the virus. These disparities also extend to cancer care, where socially and economically disadvantaged patients may experience more distress due to a lack of access to necessary supports and resources. Additionally, the pandemic has brought to light the issue of racism, particularly anti-Asian racism, which has impacted Asian healthcare workers and leaders who have been at the forefront of the pandemic response.

Title: How plants could produce a COVID-19 vaccine
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Medicago, a Canadian biopharma company, is developing a COVID-19 vaccine using a unique plant-based platform. The company's CEO, Dr. Bruce D. Clark, highlights their rapid progress, producing a vaccine candidate within 20 days of receiving the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. As of mid-May, initial pre-clinical studies were completed, with non-human primate studies and phase 1 human trials planned for the upcoming months. Medicago's platform involves using plants to produce Virus-Like Particles (VLPs), which can trigger an immune response without the risks of infection or replication. The company is also developing SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics based on antibodies from recovered donors and has around a hundred candidates. In addition to their COVID-19 efforts, Medicago is working on a seasonal flu vaccine, which is under scientific review by Health Canada, and other vaccines against rotavirus and norovirus. If approved, Medicago has the capacity to produce millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their facilities and plans to expand their production further with a new manufacturing site expected to open by 2023. The pandemic has not significantly altered the company's long-term plans, and they view it as an opportunity to showcase the usefulness of their platform in global disease preparedness.
