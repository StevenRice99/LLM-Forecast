Title: Controversy, COVID-19 and the oil crash: A look back at Jason Kenney's rise and fall
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney resigned from his position after receiving only 51% support in a leadership review vote. Kenney's time as premier was marked by a brash, combative populist style, during which he frequently clashed with various groups, including the federal government, doctors, nurses, and teachers. He also created a so-called "energy war room" to fight with oil and gas foes, but it was instead embroiled in controversies. Kenney's leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed contradictions and contributed to low poll ratings. He often tried to rally support by dividing Albertans against opponents and was criticized for not imposing health restrictions until hospitals reached dangerous capacity. Additionally, Kenney faced controversy within his own caucus, with backbenchers feeling frozen out of decision-making. Kenney's resignation came as a shock to invited guests and cabinet ministers, and the premier cited a lack of unity within the party as the reason for his departure.

Title: COVID-19 and behavior: Effects on mental health, communication
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly altered human behavior and communication in numerous ways, and society is still understanding its lasting impact. Here's a summary of the important changes discussed in the article, along with some potential implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Remote work: The pandemic led to a significant shift towards remote work, with many people working from home for the first time. This change may have long-term effects on workplace behavior and could impact future hospitalization forecasts. For example, reduced in-person interactions at offices might influence the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, affecting hospitalization rates. Spending habits: Social restrictions and lockdowns altered spending behaviors, with people purchasing more essential and non-essential items online. This shift to online shopping and bulk buying of staples may persist post-pandemic, potentially impacting the healthcare industry's ability to forecast and prepare for increased hospitalizations during disease outbreaks. Communication changes: The pandemic forced many people to rely on social media and text-based communication instead of face-to-face interactions. This shift might have long-term effects on social connections and mental health, which are essential considerations when forecasting hospitalizations, as mental health issues can impact overall health and vice versa. Mental health awareness: The pandemic negatively affected global mental health, leading to a significant increase in anxiety and depression. However, it also brought about positive changes, such as increased mental health awareness, destigmatization, and expanded treatment options, including telehealth. These developments could improve access to mental health services and potentially reduce hospitalizations related to mental health crises. Language and speech: The pandemic introduced new slang and phrases, reflecting the unique circumstances and experiences of this period. Language changes can provide insights into societal shifts and may influence how people communicate about health, illness, and hospitalization in the future. Incivility: There are anecdotal reports of increased incivility and rudeness during the pandemic, possibly due to chronic stress and an anxiety-inducing news cycle. This could have implications for healthcare workers and patients, potentially affecting the patient experience and healthcare delivery, ultimately influencing hospitalization rates and patient outcomes. These changes may have both short-term and long-term impacts on society, and understanding their interplay will be crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and developing effective public health strategies. It's important to note that the pandemic's effects vary across different populations, and localized factors should be considered when making predictions or implementing policies.

Title: COVID-19 Information and Updates
Publisher: Toronto Metropolitan University
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
As of January 18, 2023, the weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate for children and teens (aged 0-17 years) was 1.3 per 100,000—a decrease from the previous week's rate of 1.7 per 100,000. This rate has been steadily declining since the last week of December 2022. While the absolute number of pediatric hospitalizations remains relatively low compared to that of adults, it is important to interpret these numbers with caution. Children are still at risk of severe disease and complications from COVID-19, and hospitalizations can surge rapidly, especially with new variants or during community outbreaks. Several factors can help forecast and predict future trends in COVID-19 hospitalizations for children: 1. Surveillance Data: Monitoring COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates over time can help identify trends and patterns. A sudden increase in hospitalization rates may indicate a new wave or outbreak. 2. Viral Variants: The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants can significantly impact hospitalization rates, especially if the variant is more transmissible or causes more severe disease. The current dominance of the Omicron variant, which generally causes less severe illness, has contributed to lower hospitalization rates. 3. Community Transmission: High community transmission rates increase the likelihood of pediatric hospitalizations. When more people are infected, there is a higher chance that some children will experience severe disease requiring hospitalization. 4. School Holidays and Gatherings: School closures during holidays or breaks can temporarily reduce pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations by decreasing transmission among children. On the other hand, large gatherings or events involving children, especially without proper mitigation measures, can lead to spikes in hospitalizations. 5. Vaccination and Booster Rates: The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters among eligible children and teens can significantly reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization. Higher vaccination rates in the pediatric population contribute to lower hospitalization rates. 6. Healthcare System Capacity: The capacity and strain on healthcare systems can impact the number of hospitalizations reported. During surges, healthcare systems may become overwhelmed, affecting the ability to accurately capture and report hospitalization data. In conclusion, while pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization rates are currently low, it is important to remain vigilant and continue monitoring various factors that can influence future trends. By considering surveillance data, viral variants, community transmission, school dynamics, vaccination rates, and healthcare system capacity, public health officials and healthcare providers can better forecast and prepare for potential surges in pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Housing affordability in Ontario has eroded faster than any province amid COVID-19: report
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the findings of a report by Generation Squeeze, which reveals a significant decline in housing affordability in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are the key points: Housing affordability in Ontario has deteriorated at an unprecedented rate over the pandemic years, with home prices surging by 44% during Premier Doug Ford's administration. According to the report, a new homebuyer in Ontario would need to work full-time for nearly 22 years to save for a 20% down payment on a house, compared to 15 years in late 2019. The average home price in Ontario rose to $871,688 in 2021, a 44% increase since Ford took office in 2018, while wages have stagnated, particularly for young people aged 25 to 34. The report highlights the generational impact of the housing crisis, noting that between 1977 and 2019, the wealth generated from rising home values in the province disproportionately benefited older homeowners aged 55 and over. The Ontario election has seen a lack of policies addressing the housing disparity, and the current government's focus on increasing supply is insufficient to resolve the issue, according to the report's founder, Paul Kershaw. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals, and NDP have all proposed plans to increase housing supply, but the article emphasizes the need for policies that address home prices and values directly. Kershaw calls for political bravery in acknowledging the beneficiaries of rising home prices and the need for intergenerational recognition of the growing gap between home prices and earnings. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgency of addressing the housing affordability crisis in Ontario and the responsibility of provincial governments in shaping policies to mitigate the issue.

The article profiles Dr. Pieter Cullis, a 75-year-old biochemist and founder of Acuitas Therapeutics, who played a critical role in the development of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The company's expertise in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) was key to creating the vaccine, which contains billions of these nanoparticles to protect and deliver the mRNA into cells to stimulate an immune response against COVID-19. Dr. Cullis and his colleagues began working on LNP delivery systems for gene therapy and small molecule drugs decades ago, and in 2012 they started exploring mRNA-based medicines. Their work caught the attention of immunologist Drew Weissman and Katalin Kariko, who were also working on mRNA vaccines but needed an effective delivery system. The collaboration between Acuitas and the BioNTech team (which partnered with Pfizer) led to the successful development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with clinical trials showing an astonishing 95% effectiveness. Dr. Cullis and his colleagues have received international awards for their contributions to mRNA engineering, including the 2022 Canada Gairdner International Award. Dr. Cullis believes that this success is just the beginning, and predicts that within 10 years, about 40% of new medicines will be based on nanoparticle-delivered mRNA, revolutionizing the treatment of diseases such as flu, HIV, malaria, and potentially even Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the development of effective vaccines, such as the one profiled in the article, has been a critical tool in reducing severe illness and hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The high efficacy rate of 95% indicated in the clinical trials suggests that the vaccine is highly effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalizations. This technology and the collaboration between companies and researchers could also lead to faster and more effective responses to new variants or other viruses in the future, potentially reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

Title: Hand Sanitizers and COVID-19
Publisher: FDA.gov
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article provides answers to frequently asked questions about hand sanitizer and COVID-19. Here are the key points: The best way to prevent COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated and following CDC guidelines, including handwashing with plain soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a mask, and social distancing. Hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol are effective against COVID-19 when soap and water are not available. It is important to read and follow the Drug Facts label on hand sanitizer products, especially regarding use in children. Hand sanitizers are flammable and should be stored out of reach and sight of children. Ingesting hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children, so it is crucial to keep it out of their reach and monitor their use. The FDA discourages the use of sanitation tunnels that spray disinfectant onto humans, as there is a lack of data on their effectiveness and they can cause skin, eye, and airway irritation. Only ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol or 2-propanol) are permitted as active ingredients in hand sanitizers. Methanol and 1-propanol are toxic and should not be used. The FDA provides a list of hand sanitizers with potential methanol contamination, and it is important to check this list regularly and dispose of any affected products immediately. If you have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and experience symptoms, seek immediate medical treatment. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific information. However, the CDC is a reliable source for COVID-19 data and trends, including hospitalization rates. You can visit the CDC website for the latest updates and resources on COVID-19.

Title: Fewer babies born as Canada’s fertility rate hits a record low in 2020
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Canada's fertility rate has been steadily declining and dropped to a record low of 1.40 children per woman in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is similar to other countries, and Canada's population growth is primarily driven by immigration rather than fertility. The country is also seeing a shift towards later childbearing, with the average age of mothers at delivery being 31.3 years in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also influenced fertility plans, with many individuals choosing to delay having children or have fewer children. If the fertility rate continues to decline, Canada could face challenges associated with rapid population aging and increased pressure on various social and economic sectors. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of fertility rates and population trends. A declining fertility rate could lead to a decrease in the number of young people, which may result in lower hospitalization rates among the younger population. However, it is crucial to monitor the changing fertility plans and intentions of individuals to anticipate future demands on healthcare resources, especially during pandemic waves. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalization forecasts should also consider the changing age distribution and the potential for multiple pandemic waves affecting different age groups at different times. While a declining fertility rate may suggest lower hospitalization risks in the future, the pandemic's direct and indirect effects on healthcare-seeking behavior, healthcare system capacity, and the mental health and well-being of individuals of all ages cannot be overlooked.

Title: AI models identify COVID-19 patients at the greatest risk of death, injury | Waterloo News
Publisher: University of Waterloo
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed new AI models that can predict which COVID-19 patients are at the highest risk of dying or developing kidney injuries. By analyzing clinical and biochemical data, the models can identify vulnerable patients and help doctors prioritize care. The models have been designed using explainable AI technology, which means they explain the indicators used to make predictions, such as serum ferritin levels, heart rate, and blood pressure. This transparency is key to giving doctors confidence in acting on the models' findings. The research team plans to test the models in clinical settings to further improve their accuracy, and they have made their work openly available to the global scientific community. With hospitals overwhelmed by the pandemic, these AI models could help healthcare workers provide efficient and effective care, reducing both the burden on healthcare systems and costs. The AI models are expected to be transferable to other diseases and conditions as well, with researchers already exploring their use beyond COVID-19.
