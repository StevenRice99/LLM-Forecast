TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Two of the four main political party leaders in Ontario, Mike Schreiner (Green Party) and Andrea Horwath (NDP), have tested positive for COVID-19.

Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in Ontario have been trending downward in recent weeks, but the positivity rate remains above 10%. The limited number of tests reported daily suggests that COVID-19 is still circulating in the province. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of new cases among high-profile individuals (e.g. political leaders) Positivity rate (currently above 10%) Hospitalization trend (currently downward) Limited testing capacity (suggesting potential underreporting of cases) These values suggest that while hospitalizations may be trending downward, the virus is still present and circulating in the province, and new cases can still occur, even among high-profile individuals.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Influenza cases have sharply increased in Canada since the beginning of April, with 5,000 laboratory cases detected between April 17 and May 7. The majority of influenza cases were among individuals under the age of 45 years. There were 249 influenza-associated hospitalizations over the past few weeks, with a sharp increase in hospitalizations among the pediatric population. The percentage of Canadians reporting "influenza-like illness (ILI)" to doctors was 2.1%, exceeding pre-pandemic levels typical of this time of year. Ontario reported 11 new deaths linked to COVID-19 and 1,345 people hospitalized with the virus, up from 1,122. Rhinovirus test positivity (the main culprit behind the common cold) is up slightly compared to past weeks, including higher detection in Ontario compared to other provinces. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide context on the current respiratory virus landscape, including the increase in influenza cases and hospitalizations, which may impact COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Additionally, the article highlights the similarities in symptoms between COVID-19, the common cold, and influenza, which may lead to increased hospitalizations due to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.

Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including the use of additional booster doses, which can impact hospitalization rates. The article highlights the importance of considering the timing and priority of booster doses, particularly for high-risk populations such as older adults and healthcare workers. It also mentions the need for ongoing research and data collection to inform policy decisions on vaccination strategies. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The WHO recommends offering booster doses based on evidence that they would have a substantial impact on reducing hospitalization, severe disease, and death. The article notes that data on the usefulness of additional booster doses is sparse, particularly for healthy younger populations. The studies reviewed in the article suggest that additional booster doses may be beneficial for high-risk groups, such as older adults and those with immunocompromising conditions. The article highlights the importance of considering the evolution of the virus and the characteristics of future variants when making policy decisions about vaccination strategies. The WHO emphasizes the need for ongoing research and data collection to inform policy decisions on vaccination strategies, including the performance of current and variant-specific candidate COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, this article provides information on the WHO's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including the use of additional booster doses, which can impact hospitalization rates.

Title: Study tracks hospital readmission risk for COVID-19 patients in Alberta, Ontario
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study analyzed 46,412 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 in Alberta and Ontario during the first part of the pandemic and found that: The readmission rate was around 9%, similar to other ailments. Socio-economic factors and sex played a bigger role in predicting which patients were most likely to be readmitted. Patients who were male, older, and had multiple comorbidities and previous hospital visits and admissions were more likely to be readmitted. Patients from postal codes with higher deprivation indicators (e.g. lower education and income) were more likely to be admitted for COVID-19 to begin with. Vaccination status was a significant factor, with 91% of patients in Alberta and 95% in Ontario being unvaccinated. The study suggests that the healthcare system was able to withstand the pressures of the pandemic, and that care was not sacrificed despite the unprecedented pressure put on staff and systems during the peaks of the early waves. These findings can inform forecasting models by highlighting the importance of considering socio-economic factors, sex, and vaccination status in predicting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Study: Readmission rate for COVID-19 is 11%
Publisher: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
TRUE This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 11% of Canadian patients discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19 were readmitted to the hospital or died within 30 days of discharge. 95% of patients admitted with COVID-19 in Ontario were unvaccinated. The median length of hospital stay was 8 days. 14% of patients required intensive care unit admission. Patients who were readmitted or died were more likely to be older, male, discharged to a long-term care facility, and have a medical history of multiple hospitalizations. Non-specific pneumonia was the most often cited reason for readmission (37.6%). These values can inform forecasting models by providing insight into the likelihood of readmission or death after discharge, the impact of vaccination status on hospitalization rates, and the demographic characteristics of patients who are most likely to experience severe outcomes.
