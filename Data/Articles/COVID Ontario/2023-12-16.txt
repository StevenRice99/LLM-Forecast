Title: Not too late to get flu, COVID-19 shots before Christmas: experts
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Alberta has seen a record-breaking number of lab-confirmed influenza cases in the week ending December 9, with 1,800 cases, primarily driven by influenza A (H1N1). This has raised concerns about the impact on hospitalizations, especially with the upcoming Christmas gatherings. Experts recommend getting vaccinated as the top preventive measure, followed by avoiding large crowds and wearing masks. The low flu vaccination rate in Alberta, currently at 22.1%, is concerning, and pharmacists are encouraging walk-in vaccinations. The high number of influenza cases, combined with already stressed hospitals, could lead to capacity issues. Influenza and COVID-19 shots have been updated for the most likely strains this season.

Title: Allergic Reactions after COVID-19 Vaccination
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Those who experience a severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by difficulty breathing, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the throat or tongue, or a widespread rash, should not receive another dose of the same type of vaccine. They may, however, be able to receive an alternative type of COVID-19 vaccine. Non-severe allergic reactions, on the other hand, such as reactions that occur within 4 hours of vaccination but are not considered severe by a medical professional, typically allow an individual to receive another dose of the same vaccine type under observation. Individuals with a history of allergic reactions to other vaccines, injectables, or medications can likely still receive a COVID-19 vaccine, although consulting a doctor beforehand is recommended. In the case of ingredient-specific allergies, receiving the alternate type of COVID-19 vaccine may be an option for severe reactions, while non-severe reactions may still allow vaccination with certain precautions. "COVID arm," a red, itchy, swollen, or painful rash at the injection site, is not a contraindication for subsequent doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, including the 2023-2024 formula. Antihistamines and pain medications can be taken to alleviate discomfort. Overall, safeguards are in place to ensure the safety of individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines, and personalized advice from doctors or allergy and immunology specialists is available for those with specific concerns or medical histories.

The New Brunswick Auditor General, Paul Martin, released an audit of the provincial government's COVID-19 response, identifying several areas for improvement. The audit examined the decisions made by the Department of Health, Justice and Public Safety, and Education and Early Childhood Development between April 2020 and March 2022. Martin found that the Department of Health could not provide evidence to support 33 Public Health decisions made during the pandemic, including border closures and masking policies. He also discovered that the department's hotel isolation program cost over $5.4 million, with only nine travelers testing positive for COVID-19, and that students lost about 17 weeks of learning due to school closures. In addition, the audit revealed a lack of established criteria for compassionate travel exemption requests, with many decisions lacking documented rationales. The department also struggled to ensure COVID-19 test kits were provided when and where they were needed most. Martin made several recommendations, including improving record-keeping practices, establishing clear decision-making criteria, and increasing data-systems capacity to monitor test inventory. The Department of Health agreed with the recommendations and committed to enhancing its record-keeping practices during health emergencies. The audit did not find evidence of political interference in the decision-making process, but Martin emphasized the importance of retaining documentation to ensure transparency and accountability. The lack of evidence made it difficult to assess the basis for some decisions, and he expressed hope that the legislature would hold the department accountable to prevent similar issues in the future.

Title: Kingston General Hospital 'bursting at the seams' with COVID-19 and respiratory illness patients
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The Kingston General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, is struggling to keep up with a surge in emergency department admissions, including a near-record 580 admissions in one day. The hospital is opening "non-traditional spaces" to accommodate the influx of patients as the respiratory virus season, including COVID-19, RSV, and the flu, peaks across the province. The hospital is also facing a shortage of healthcare workers, which is a challenge in staffing the facility adequately. They are anticipating a 120% occupancy rate and are preparing a large gym as an inpatient unit in case of emergency department transfers during the holidays. Wait times for an initial assessment remain around the average of 3.1 hours, but patients with less urgent conditions may experience longer waits. Health officials in Ontario warn that an increase in COVID-19 and respiratory infections is causing higher than average wait times in emergency departments across the province. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to monitor admissions, occupancy rates, and healthcare worker availability, as well as encourage community members to get vaccinated, wear masks, and stay home when sick.

Here is a summary of the article: The article reflects on the role of evaluators during the COVID-19 pandemic and the insights shared in the publication "Policy Evaluation in the Era of COVID-19" and a corresponding webinar hosted by the Max Bell School of Public Policy. The discussion focuses on the challenges, successes, and failures of evaluation practices during the pandemic and offers insights for improving future responses to global crises. Mariel Aramburu's meta-analysis of literature from 2020-2021 highlights evaluators' top concerns during the pandemic, including evolving evaluation methodologies, ethical considerations, remote data collection, and prioritizing marginalized voices. Indran A. Naidoo critiques the evaluation sector's responsiveness during the crisis, calling for a transformative shift towards agile, multi-disciplinary, and immediate evaluation practices using diverse data sources. He emphasizes the need for evaluators to adapt to new realities and reassess their relevance in addressing societal challenges. Steve Montague calls for a departure from conventional evaluation practices, highlighting promising emerging practices and the importance of recalibration, collaboration, and adaptable approaches. He advocates for a revisioning of evaluation as a thinking approach, emphasizing rigorous causation analysis and contextualized behavioral systems. Pearl Eliadis focuses on the inadequate integration of human rights within evaluation frameworks, proposing a reevaluation of human rights as a fundamental aspect of ethical hierarchy in evaluation, especially given the pandemic's disproportionate impact on marginalized groups. Robert E. Lahey and Dorothy Lucks discuss the pandemic's effect on evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), noting the complexity of the targets and the crucial role of evaluation in progress assessment. They emphasize the need for adapting evaluation tools and evaluators' role as facilitators, analyzing outcomes for disadvantaged groups, and engaging stakeholders early. Jeremy Lonsdale presents the innovative approaches taken by audit institutions in the UK and Canada to generate valuable information during the crisis, despite data collection challenges, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of these institutions. Finally, Ray C. Rist wraps up the discussion with five observations, including the impact of incomplete data on understanding the pandemic, the shift towards increased government intervention, the societal flaws exposed by the crisis, the consequences of misinformation on vaccination rates, and the impossibility of fully returning to pre-pandemic normalcy. Overall, the article and the accompanying publication and webinar provide valuable insights into the role of evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering lessons learned and potential areas for improvement to enhance future crisis response and evaluation practices. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, important factors to consider include the infection rate in the population, the availability and uptake of vaccines and booster shots, the emergence of new variants, the capacity of the healthcare system, and the implementation of public health measures. These factors can help predict the likelihood of hospitalizations increasing or decreasing in a specific region or population.

Title: A synthesis of evidence for policy from behavioural science during COVID-19
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article presents an evaluation of claims made in a previous paper by Van Bavel et al. on the behavioral science of COVID-19. The evaluation aims to assess the validity of the claims and provide insights into the behavioral aspects of the pandemic. The process involved two independent teams of reviewers, including authors of the original study and independent behavioral scientists and policymakers. The reviewers assessed relevant articles and reports published before June 1, 2022, using a standardized approach. The evaluation focused on 19 claims related to various aspects of the pandemic, such as the effectiveness of targeted messaging and the influence of political polarization. The reviewers rated the level of evidence for each claim, including the study design, the setting, the direction of the effect, and the effect size. The article included preprints to reduce potential publication bias and capture the visibility and impact of preprints during the pandemic. The reviewers represented institutions from over 30 countries, with some representation from every continent. A total of 747 articles were assessed, covering 142 countries. The evidence was rated based on the highest-quality studies, focusing on field studies and real-world settings rather than averaging all available evidence. The reviewers showed high inter-rater agreement, and the evaluation results are available for public use.

The infographic presents data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, with three positive mental health indicators evaluated over three survey cycles during the pandemic. The first indicator, "Excellent or very good mental health," showed a slight decline from 59.9% in cycle one (Sept-Dec 2020) to 51.9% in cycle two (Feb-May 2021), but then improved to 56.8% in cycle three (Feb-May 2023). The second indicator, "Strong sense of belonging," also dipped between cycle one (63.6%) and cycle two (56.9%) before increasing to 61.6% in cycle three. A similar trend was observed for "High life satisfaction," with the lowest percentage of respondents reporting this in cycle two (44.6%) and a rebound in cycle three (53.6%). Overall, the data suggests a general improvement in positive mental health indicators over the course of the pandemic, with a dip in well-being during the period of cycle two. While this data does not directly forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it offers insights into the mental health of individuals during the pandemic. Mental health is closely linked to overall health and well-being, and poor mental health can impact physical health and vice versa. Therefore, understanding the mental health status of a population can provide context for healthcare demands, including potential hospitalizations. For example, a decline in mental health could indicate increased stress or anxiety, which may lead to compromised immune systems and a higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms requiring hospitalization. Additionally, the data highlights the resilience of individuals, as the indicators generally improved or rebounded over time, suggesting that people may have adapted to the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 home testing as important as ever, infectious disease specialist says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease specialist, advises that it is still important to be vigilant and take precautionary measures against COVID-19, even almost four years into the pandemic. She recommends keeping a supply of rapid tests at home and testing before visiting hospitals or healthcare facilities. While the pandemic is no longer in its emergency phase, COVID-19 is still a concern, especially with hospitals currently being very full. Dr. Barrett emphasizes the usefulness of testing, even with a negative result, as it can help manage the virus and prevent hospitalizations. She also advises waiting for the recommended duration after an infection before getting a vaccine booster to ensure the most effective immune response. The article mentions that rapid tests have expiration dates and new ones can be acquired from various sources, such as public markets, grocery stores, and pharmacies. Dr. Barrett encourages individuals to acquire tests for themselves and others who may have mobility issues. PCR tests are still offered to certain high-risk individuals, and the COVID-19 vaccine remains protective against severe illness and hospitalization. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the current situation in hospitals, the availability and usage of rapid tests, vaccination rates, and the circulating virus strain. Dr. Barrett's advice on testing and vaccination can help mitigate the impact of the virus and reduce hospitalizations.
