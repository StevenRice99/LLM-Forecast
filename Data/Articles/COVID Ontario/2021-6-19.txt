Title: Why COVID-19 may now feel like a 'bad cold' — with headache, runny nose among most-reported symptoms
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the potential shift in symptoms experienced by individuals with COVID-19 as the virus mutates and vaccination rates increase. Experts note that if this trend continues, it could make tracking the virus' spread more difficult, especially among vulnerable populations such as those in congregate-care settings or schools.
Some of the key points made in the article include:
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19.
As vaccination rates increase, symptoms experienced by individuals with COVID-19 may become less severe, potentially making testing more difficult.
A targeted approach to testing may be necessary, focusing on high-risk settings such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, and schools.
The article highlights the importance of continued vigilance in monitoring COVID-19 transmission and adapting public health measures accordingly.
Overall, the article suggests that while it's good news if COVID-19 experiences are shifting towards milder symptoms, this shift also means that we need to be more targeted in our approach to testing and surveillance.

Average wait time in hospital for an ALC patient in Ontario is around 5 months (some stay considerably longer).
Number of ALC patients peaked at "historic heights" of 5,300 during the pandemic.
ALC patients made up between 16.5 to 18 per cent of beds during peak periods.
Since the directive was put in place, approximately 3,400 ALC patients have been transferred out of Ontario hospitals.

Title: COVID-19 Vaccination for People with Disabilities
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The provided text discusses the challenges faced by people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts in Ontario, Canada. The key points are:
Accessibility of Public Health Units (PHU) 
A review of PHU websites on May 7, 2021, found varying levels of accessibility for people with disabilities.
Some PHUs had accessible websites, multiple booking options, sign language interpretation, and private booths available.
However, others lacked accessible communication, physical infrastructure, or social/sensory accommodations.
Vaccine Distribution Among People with Disabilities 
Adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) were less likely to receive COVID-19 vaccinations compared to the general population.
Data analysis revealed that only 25% of IDD individuals received their first dose by April 2021, while 60% had not been vaccinated at all.
Recommendations 
People with disabilities already included in high-risk groups should be prioritized for earlier second doses of COVID-19 vaccine and supported to rebook appointments.
Publicly available data on COVID-19 vaccination rates for people with disabilities should be monitored and reported regularly.
Mechanisms should be put in place to improve the overall accessibility of vaccination services for Ontarians with disabilities.
Methods Used 
A review of PHU websites was conducted to assess their accessibility.
Health administrative records were linked using unique encoded identifiers to analyze vaccine distribution among adults with IDD.
The use of data was authorized under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act.

Title: How tracking ethnicity and occupation data is helping fight COVID-19
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses how different provinces in Canada handled COVID-19 data, particularly when it comes to reporting ethnicity-specific information. The province of Peel, Ontario, used targeted messaging and outreach programs to reach specific communities, such as those with high South Asian populations, resulting in higher vaccination rates.
In contrast, other provinces like British Columbia (B.C.) did not release detailed neighborhood-level infection rates, citing concerns about stigma and privacy. B.C.'s data was only released after a leak revealed that the province had been collecting it. Metro Vancouver neighborhoods with high proportions of South Asians were found to have significantly higher COVID-19 rates.
Manitoba's government also cited concerns about stigmatization and privacy when explaining why they did not release ethnicity-specific information on COVID-19 cases.
The article quotes Dr. Kwame McKenzie, CEO of the Wellesley Institute, saying that it should be illegal not to collect data on health outcomes for different ethnic groups, as it is essential for equitable public services, especially during a pandemic.
Key points from the article include:
Peel's targeted approach helped increase vaccination rates in communities with high South Asian populations.
B.C. did not release detailed neighborhood-level infection rates, despite having collected this information.
Manitoba cited concerns about stigma and privacy when justifying their lack of ethnicity-specific data on COVID-19 cases.
Dr. McKenzie believes that collecting ethnicity-specific data is essential for equitable public services during a pandemic.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of collecting accurate and detailed data to inform targeted public health responses, especially in vulnerable communities.

268 ICU patients needed a ventilator to breathe.
The R-effective number, which shows the rate of spread, is down to 0.72.
64.1% of Ontario's total population has had at least one dose of vaccine.
74% of Ontarians 18 and above have gotten a first shot — above the 70% threshold for moving into Phase 2 of the province's reopening plan.
The delta variant accounts for about 40% of all new cases in the province.
