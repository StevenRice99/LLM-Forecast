TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article discusses the issue of Alternate Level of Care (ALC) patients in Ontario hospitals, who occupy hospital beds but do not require hospital-level care. The number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals has been rising, with approximately 4,000 ALC patients currently in hospitals.

During the pandemic, the number of ALC patients peaked at "historic heights" of 5,300 patients twice, making up between 16.5 to 18 per cent of beds. The Ontario Hospital Association says that since the directive was put in place, approximately 3,400 ALC patients have been transferred out of Ontario hospitals. The article highlights the importance of freeing up hospital capacity, particularly during the pandemic, and the need to create innovative options to care for ALC patients. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals (approximately 4,000) Average wait time in hospital for an ALC patient (around five months) Peak number of ALC patients during the pandemic (5,300) Percentage of beds occupied by ALC patients (16.5 to 18 per cent) Number of ALC patients transferred out of Ontario hospitals (approximately 3,400) These values can be used to inform forecasting models and predict the potential impact of ALC patients on hospital capacity in Ontario, Canada.

Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 35,000 people living with HIV in B.C. and Ontario will be tracked for COVID-19 vaccine uptake and rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalizations. The study will investigate the impact of social determinants of health on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. Earlier research has found that most existing vaccines require higher or additional doses to provide optimal protection for those living with HIV, which may inform forecasting models. The study's findings will help inform Canada's COVID-19 vaccine rollout and support the development of more effective immunization and public health strategies for vulnerable and diverse Canadians living with HIV.

Trusted: True

TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on people with disabilities and the need for accessible vaccination strategies to reach this population. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: 22% of Ontarians have a disability, and this population has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, accounting for nearly 60% of COVID-19 deaths in the UK. People with disabilities have higher rates of chronic health conditions that are associated with COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalization and death. Accessibility considerations, including communication, physical, and social and sensory environment-based accessibility, are crucial for ensuring that people with disabilities can access COVID-19 vaccinations. Ontario has prioritized people with disabilities in its COVID-19 vaccination program, but there is a difference between availability and accessibility of vaccination, and more needs to be done to address accessibility barriers. Data monitoring on COVID-19 vaccination and disability can inform accessibility initiatives and help track vaccination rates among people with disabilities. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering the needs of people with disabilities in COVID-19 vaccination strategies and provides insights into the barriers and challenges that this population faces in accessing vaccinations. By addressing these barriers and improving accessibility, Ontario can work towards reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality rates among people with disabilities.
