Title: Why COVID-19 cases are surging across Canada and what needs to be done

The article discusses the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and Alberta, specifically, and highlights the need for a more effective strategy to control the spread of the virus.
Key points:
A "circuit breaker" model from the UK, which involves brief lockdowns to interrupt transmission and reverse rising case numbers quickly, is suggested as a possible approach.
Premier Jason Kenney has urged Albertans to stop social gatherings at home and expanded restrictions on social gatherings in communities with high COVID-19 cases.
Public health experts are concerned about the rising number of community transmission cases and inadequate contact tracing in Alberta.
British Columbia has seen record-high COVID-19 case numbers, and experts there are worried that it may jeopardize their progress if they don't regain control over the surge.
The Atlantic bubble model, which involves tight restrictions on points of entry, aggressive contact tracing, and isolating new cases, is highlighted as a success story for curbing COVID-19 spread.
Expert opinions:
Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease specialist, suggests that new public health restrictions focused on limiting gathering sizes, mandating masks in healthcare facilities, and threatening businesses with closures may help drive down case numbers without the need for lockdowns.
Susan Kirkland, epidemiologist at Dalhousie University, emphasizes the need for constant vigilance to avoid letting the guard down, especially as rising cases across Canada show that COVID-19 can spread quickly anywhere.
Overall, the article suggests that a more effective strategy is needed to control the spread of COVID-19 in Alberta and other parts of Canada.
