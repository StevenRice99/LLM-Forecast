The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: The Ontario government's new COVID-19 modelling data suggests that if cases grow at a rate of 3% per day, the province will record nearly 3,500 cases per day by December 13, and if cases grow at a 5% rate, Ontario could see 6,500 cases per day by that period. The current growth rate of COVID-19 cases in Ontario has been 3.895% per day on average over the past 14 days, and 6% over the last three days. At a growth rate of 5%, Ontario will have more cases per capita than France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. The current measures in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 are not enough to curb the current trajectory. Under the 5% growth scenario, Ontario could have more than 400 patients in intensive care within the next six weeks, which would make it "impossible" to handle non-COVID-19 needs. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Ontario have increased by 61% in the past three weeks and 167% in the past six weeks. The situation in Ontario's long-term care homes is worsening, with resident mortality increasing each week, and 71 deaths occurring in the last seven days. These values suggest a rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Ontario, which could lead to a significant strain on the healthcare system and potentially overwhelm hospital capacity.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Ontario reported 1,328 new cases on Sunday and 1,242 new cases on Monday, indicating a high and potentially increasing number of cases in the province. The prime minister warned that vaccines will not bring an immediate resolution to the pandemic, emphasizing the need to control the spread of COVID-19 in the coming months. The article mentions that health officials in Quebec are seeing a worsening situation in some areas, including the Saguenay—Lac-St-Jean area, which has more than double the provincial rate of cases per 100,000 people. This could be a warning sign for Ontario, which shares a border with Quebec. The region of Saguenay—Lac-St-Jean has 312 active cases per 100,000 people, which is a high rate that could lead to increased hospitalizations. These values suggest that Ontario is experiencing a high number of cases, and the situation may worsen in the coming months before vaccines become available. This information can be used to inform forecasting models and predict potential hospitalization rates in Ontario.

Title: Why COVID-19 cases are surging across Canada and what needs to be done
Publisher: CBC.ca

Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the current situation in Ontario, where cases are spiking, and hospitalizations are increasing. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: The seven-day average of cases in Ontario has grown to nearly 1,000. There are currently almost 150 outbreaks in long-term care homes in Ontario. The largest number of COVID-19 deaths in a single day happened recently in Ontario. Experts say the province doesn't have a clear enough view of the situation, with over half of Ontario's cases having no known link to previous cases and community transmission running rampant. Ontario is moving to ease restrictions on much of the province, despite not hitting its full testing capacity and contact tracing and isolation of cases not functioning in hot spots like Toronto. Experts warn that if the number of cases is not brought down from 1,000 a day to something like 50 or 100 per day, the situation could worsen. These points suggest that the current situation in Ontario is highly unstable, and the province is at risk of experiencing a significant increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations.
