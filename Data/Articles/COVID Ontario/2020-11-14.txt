Title: COVID-19 vaccine update: Pfizer may be the frontrunner, but Canada has hedged its bets
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article provides an overview of the different types of vaccines being developed for COVID-19 and highlights the progress of seven companies that have signed contracts with the Canadian government. Here is a summary, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Pfizer and BioNTech have announced preliminary results from their Phase 3 clinical trial, showing their vaccine to be 90% effective. The vaccine is simple to manufacture but requires very low storage temperatures. Canada has signed contracts with seven companies for a total of 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, diversifying the types of vaccines it will have access to. The different types of vaccines in development include inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines (subunit and virus-like particle), viral vector vaccines, and RNA/DNA vaccines. Inactivated vaccines use viruses that have been rendered inactive and trigger an immune response when injected. Recombinant protein vaccines use a portion of the spike protein to trigger an immune response, while virus-like particle vaccines mimic the shape of the virus without containing genetic material. Viral vector vaccines use a non-pathogenic virus, such as an adenovirus, to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the body. RNA and DNA vaccines are novel strategies that use genetic material to produce a viral protein, triggering an immune response. Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, Novavax, Sanofi/GSK, and Medicago are the seven companies with agreements with Canada. Canada has reserved 76 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech, 56 million from Moderna, 38 million from Johnson & Johnson, 20 million from AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, 76 million from Novavax, 72 million from Sanofi/GSK, and 76 million from Medicago. The vaccine candidates are in different stages of clinical trials, with some in Phase 3 testing their efficacy in large populations. These developments provide hope for the control and eventual end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The diversification of vaccine types and the large number of doses secured by Canada could help ensure a steady supply for its citizens and potentially for other countries. However, it is important to note that the preliminary results and efficacy rates are subject to change as the clinical trials continue and more data is analyzed. The duration of protection and potential side-effects are also important factors to consider in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Starting with why: Explaining the science behind COVID-19 to enhance public health
Publisher: Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of effective communication and messaging to promote public health measures and behavior change. Dr. Holly Witteman, a researcher and Canada Research Chair in Human-Centred Digital Health, emphasizes the need to build trust and provide clear explanations of the science behind public health guidelines. Her team is creating adaptable digital health materials, such as an interactive demonstration explaining social distancing, to address confusion and concerns about COVID-19. These materials will be made publicly available in multiple languages and will cover topics like changing public health advice and the effectiveness of different prevention measures. Additionally, Dr. Witteman's team plans to develop a "patient decision aid" to address questions and emotions related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available. This tool will help individuals make informed decisions about vaccination by connecting research evidence with personal values and emotions. Effective communication about the 'why' behind public health measures is crucial to gaining public trust and adherence to recommendations, ultimately helping to forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Exploring life after COVID-19: the far side of the moon
Publisher: Bank of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential output growth in Canada and globally. The Bank of Canada expects the recovery to continue but predicts a lower profile for potential output, indicating a diminished ability to generate goods, services, and incomes sustainably. The reduction in potential output growth is attributed to factors such as decreased investment in capital, scarring in the workforce, and disruptions in productivity. The level of Canadian potential output is expected to be 3% lower by 2022 compared to pre-pandemic expectations, resulting in a significant economic gap. The article emphasizes the importance of growth in managing the debt load accumulated during the pandemic and over the last decade. It highlights the vulnerability of countries like Canada that depend on foreign capital and run current account deficits. Enhancing productivity and competitiveness are crucial, and the impact of technological change and digitalization is addressed. While technological advancements create more jobs overall, they can also lead to sectoral shifts that leave certain groups without jobs and struggling to find new ones. The rise of superstar firms with considerable market power due to user data monopoly power further contributes to wage stagnation and inequality. The article challenges the conventional wisdom that social and economic goals are mutually exclusive. It highlights examples such as Quebec's public daycare system, which had positive social and economic impacts by helping families and increasing women's participation in the workforce. It emphasizes the need to address inequality and strengthen social well-being to enhance economic growth and resilience.

Title: Report predicts increased youth mental health struggles related to COVID-19
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the potential mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth in British Columbia, Canada. The report, released by Simon Fraser University's Children's Health Policy Centre, suggests that the pandemic will have significant negative effects on the mental health of young people, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, and behavioral problems. These issues can persist into adulthood if left untreated, underlining the importance of investing in child and youth mental health services. The article also highlights that some children may be more vulnerable to these impacts, including those with pre-existing mental health conditions, neurodiverse individuals, youth in foster care, and those facing socioeconomic disadvantages or racism. Additionally, Indigenous peoples, who often face colonial harms such as unsafe housing and food insecurity, may be disproportionately affected. To mitigate these consequences, the report calls for government investment in mental health services to support children and youth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Immigration detention centres emptied over fear of possible COVID-19 outbreaks
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is reducing the number of people in its detention centers to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As of November, the detention centers in Laval, Toronto, and Surrey were well below capacity, with only 12, 18, and 11 detainees respectively. Lawyers and advocates have long called for the release of immigration detainees, arguing that most do not represent a danger to Canada. Between April 2019 and March 2020, CBSA detained 8,825 people, including 138 minors, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Of these, close to 2,000 were held in provincial jails. However, as of last week, there were only 94 immigration detainees in provincial jails. The pandemic has led to a decrease in immigration demands and an increase in the use of alternative solutions to detention, such as community monitoring programs. The John Howard Society of Quebec, which runs one such program, has seen its caseload double since the pandemic began. The majority of detainees released into the community adhere to the conditions of their release, and the organization has lost track of only two individuals since the program began. Advocates hope that the federal government will continue to use alternative solutions to detention even after the pandemic ends. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested that the pandemic has led to reflections on doing things "differently or better" in the future. The office of Public Safety Minister Bill Blair has stated that immigration detention has always been a last resort and that the CBSA explores all options for release when an individual's risk can be managed in the community.

Title: Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine: Meet the scientists who developed the vaccine
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article profiles scientists Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci, the founders of BioNTech, who have developed a groundbreaking coronavirus vaccine in partnership with US pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The vaccine has been shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing infection, using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to spark an immune response. This medical advance is a significant step forward in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and offers hope for the world. Ugur Sahin, the CEO of BioNTech, and his wife Ozlem Tureci, the company's Chief Medical Officer, are veterans in the world of medical research and have dedicated their lives to oncology and infectious disease research. They have a longstanding commitment to academia and science and are known for their charitable ethos. The couple's Covid-19 vaccine approach uses mRNA to trick cells into producing protein bits that resemble the virus, teaching the immune system to recognize and attack those pieces, leading to a faster reaction to infection. Despite their success, Sahin is described as modest and humble, and he believes that their vaccine will not be the only effective solution to Covid-19. BioNTech and Pfizer plan to ramp up production of their vaccine candidate, aiming to manufacture up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 if authorized. The companies will seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, with a request potentially coming as early as next week. This development offers a promising forecast for COVID-19 hospitalizations, as the vaccine could significantly reduce the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization.

Title: Federal government announces funding for COVID-19 research projects
Publisher: University of Calgary
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Three University of Calgary research projects aimed at improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 have received federal funding. The first project focuses on tracking COVID-19 in Calgary's wastewater, as SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is excreted in the feces of infected individuals, even before symptoms start. By testing wastewater samples from different areas of the city, researchers can identify areas with increasing COVID-19 cases and target active case-finding. The second project involves using state-of-the-art imaging to study sepsis caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its effects on the lungs, which could lead to more effective treatments for severe COVID-19 patients. The third project aims to evaluate different patient and environmental samples to determine the influence of viral load on clinical outcomes and transmission rates and to assess the effectiveness of clinical tests in identifying asymptomatic and low-level COVID-19 cases. These projects will improve the understanding of COVID-19 and lead to advancements in detection, diagnosis, and treatment, which could ultimately help forecast hospitalizations by identifying areas with increasing cases and understanding the factors influencing clinical outcomes.

Title: Hydroxychloroquine does not benefit adults hospitalized with COVID-19
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated with Hydroxychloroquine among Inpatients with symptomatic Disease (ORCHID) trial was a National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The trial began in April 2020 and enrolled 479 patients at 34 hospitals across the United States. The results of the trial showed that hydroxychloroquine does not provide any clinical benefit to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and does not improve clinical outcomes. The finding was consistent across patient subgroups and for all evaluated outcomes, including clinical status, mortality, organ failures, duration of oxygen use, and hospital length of stay. The careful design, implementation, and oversight of the study were key to its success, and the recommendation by a data and safety monitoring board to stop the trial early was also important. As of November 2, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported more than 9.1 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 230,000 deaths in the United States. The ORCHID trial provides important information for healthcare practitioners and researchers working to find effective treatments for COVID-19. Many other randomized clinical trials are also underway to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of other agents versus a placebo in the urgent race for effective therapies.

Here is a summary of the article: As of November 7, 2020, there were 116 new cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 3,738. Of these, 985 cases were considered active, and 2,726 people had recovered. Thirty-four people were hospitalized, with eight in intensive care. The province also reported two new deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 27. The new cases were distributed across most zones in the province, with the highest number in Saskatoon (38) and Regina (39) zones. The source of infections for many cases was unknown, with a significant proportion being community contacts or under investigation. The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) warned of a potential superspreader event in Saskatoon on October 24 and recommended anyone who attended City Centre Bingo to get tested for COVID-19, especially if they were experiencing symptoms. To limit the spread of COVID-19, a public health order was in effect, limiting indoor private gatherings to a maximum of 10 people and mandating the use of non-medical masks in indoor public spaces in Saskatoon, Regina, and Prince Albert. The article also encouraged the use of the COVID Alert app, a voluntary digital tool to notify users of potential exposure to COVID-19.
