Here is a summary of the article: Dr. Tamara Fong, an expert in cognitive health and neurology, provides an overview of important factors to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Here are the key points: Hospitalization forecasts are crucial for healthcare capacity planning and resource allocation. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate is influenced by various factors, including vaccination status, booster doses, and the prevalence of new variants. Unvaccinated individuals have a significantly higher risk of hospitalization compared to those who are fully vaccinated and boosted. Pre-existing conditions: People with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, are more likely to require hospitalization if infected with COVID-19. Age: Older individuals, especially those above 60 or with weakened immune systems, are at a higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Community transmission rates: High community transmission rates can overwhelm healthcare systems and lead to increased hospitalizations. Healthcare system capacity: The availability of hospital beds, ICU capacity, and healthcare staff can impact hospitalization rates and patient outcomes. Social and economic factors: These include access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and adherence to public health measures, which can influence infection rates and the likelihood of hospitalization. Surveillance data: Monitoring wastewater for viral RNA and tracking flu-like illnesses can provide early warning signs of COVID-19 surges and help forecast hospitalizations. Genetic sequencing: Tracking new variants and understanding their transmissibility and severity can impact hospitalization forecasts. Seasonality: COVID-19 may exhibit seasonal patterns, with higher transmission rates during colder months, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations. Public health measures: The effectiveness of measures like masking, social distancing, and vaccination campaigns can influence hospitalization rates. In conclusion, forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations requires considering a multitude of factors. By analyzing these variables and utilizing surveillance data and modeling techniques, healthcare officials can better prepare for surges in hospitalizations and allocate resources effectively.

The article presents data and analysis from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) of the Northwest Territories (NWT) in Canada, providing insights into the factors that impact the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death. Here's a summary: Individuals over 80 years old face the highest risk of hospitalization (322.1 per 10,000 persons) and death (161 per 10,000 persons) due to COVID-19. There were no deaths among residents under 30 and no hospitalizations in the 5-14 age group in the NWT. Unvaccinated individuals had a hospitalization rate nearly four times higher and a death rate over 3.5 times higher than those who received two or more vaccine doses. The Delta variant led to higher hospitalization and death rates (5.5 times greater) compared to the Omicron variant. During the Delta wave, the NWT's hospitalization and death rates were 1.5 times higher than during the Omicron wave. However, the Delta wave lasted longer (four months) compared to the Omicron wave (three months). As of March 14, 2022, there have been a total of 100 hospitalizations, 29 ICU admissions, and 20 deaths due to COVID-19 in the NWT. The Delta wave resulted in 57 hospitalizations, 18 ICU admissions, and 12 deaths, with unvaccinated individuals having significantly higher hospitalization and death rates. The Omicron wave has resulted in more infections but lower hospitalization and death rates. There have been 38 hospitalizations, nine ICU admissions, and eight deaths during this wave. Increasing age is a critical factor in the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, similar to trends observed in other Canadian jurisdictions and internationally. During the Delta wave, residents of Tch, Sahtu, and Yellowknife had higher rates of severe outcomes compared to other NWT regions. During the Omicron wave, most regions have similar rates. Vaccines provided strong protection against severe outcomes during the Delta wave. Canadian and international data suggest that while two doses offer protection, a booster dose maximizes protection against hospitalizations, especially after six or more months. The CPHO's analysis highlights the importance of age, vaccination status, and the virus variant in determining the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. This information can help forecast hospitalizations and guide public health measures to protect vulnerable populations.

Title: Is there a link between the pandemic and divorce?
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on divorce rates in Canada, specifically in 2020 when lockdowns were common. Interestingly, there was a significant drop in registered divorces in Canada during that year, with a 25% decrease since 1968 when the Divorce Act was passed. This decrease may be attributed to the difficulties in accessing court services during the pandemic. However, it is also noted that divorce rates in Canada have been generally declining since 1991 as fewer people marry and more choose common-law relationships. While the initial data suggests a decrease in divorces, the article raises the question of what the long-term impact of the pandemic might be on marital trajectories. It is possible that the intense period of time spent at home with spouses during lockdowns could have either strengthened or weakened relationships in ways that may not be reflected in the 2020 divorce statistics. The full picture of how the pandemic influenced divorce rates and marital dynamics may only become clear in the coming years as more data becomes available. Therefore, forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations based on this article's information is challenging, as the potential psychological and social ramifications of the pandemic on individuals and their relationships are complex and multifaceted.

Title: New Brunswick lifts all COVID-19 restrictions for 2nd time, hopes for different outcome
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
New Brunswick has lifted all COVID-19 restrictions, including provincially mandated masks, limits on gatherings, and distancing rules. While this decision has been met with concern from some experts, Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health, assured the public that the pandemic is not over and that more variants and surges are expected. New Brunswick has a high vaccination rate, with 50.6% of eligible residents receiving their booster dose and 87.3% receiving two doses. This is an improvement from two months ago when the province entered Level 3 restrictions, with only 28.7% boosted and 83.3% double-dosed. Modeling by Public Health epidemiologists predicts that while there may be some increases in cases and hospitalizations, they are not expected to be overwhelming. However, personal risk management is still encouraged, especially for those who are 50 or older, immunocompromised, or have chronic conditions. The province has not specified any hospitalization or case rates that would trigger a return of restrictions.

Title: COVID and the Heart: It Spares No One
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False

Here is a summary of the article: In a recent study, Ziyad Al-Aly found that people who have had COVID-19 are at an increased risk of developing heart problems for at least a year after infection, even if they only experienced mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. This is contrary to previous beliefs that only severe cases of COVID-19 led to long-term health complications. The study included nearly 11 million participants and found that COVID-19 survivors had a higher risk of arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, stroke, blood clots, heart failure, and heart attacks. Interestingly, these complications were observed even in previously healthy individuals without traditional heart disease risk factors. The exact mechanisms behind these heart issues are not yet fully understood, but several theories are proposed. One theory suggests that the intense inflammation caused by the virus and the body's immune response may affect the heart. Another theory suggests that COVID-19 may attack the endothelial cells lining the vessels of the heart, leading to clot formation and blockages. The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also play a role by engaging with the ACE receptor, allowing the virus to enter and affect heart cells. This new evidence has important implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it suggests that even mild cases of COVID-19 can lead to serious long-term health issues. It highlights the need for continued research and monitoring of COVID-19 survivors to identify and address these heart-related complications effectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a strain on healthcare systems and laboratories, with demand for testing and surveillance exceeding initial forecasts. Dr. Prameet Sheth, a clinical microbiologist and researcher at Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC), recalls that early plans anticipated 20-50 COVID-19 tests per day, but during the Omicron surge, his lab processed over 1,200 tests daily. The microbiology lab at KHSC, which diagnoses infectious diseases for Eastern Ontario, has transformed to accommodate COVID-19 testing, which now accounts for half of its workload. In addition to diagnostic testing, the lab plays a crucial role in research and development. The Ontario Ministry of Health requested whole-genome analysis of the virus to track variants and sub-variants, and KHSC is one of four hospital labs in the province conducting this surveillance. Dr. Sheth compares the mobilization to a military response in a crisis, highlighting the exponential increase in testing capacity and the challenges of maintaining a 24-hour turnaround. The expansion required new equipment and staff, with recruitment from Queen's and St. Lawrence College. Dr. Lewis Tomalty, Associate Professor and Service Chief of Clinical Microbiology at KHSC, reflects on pandemic planning exercises from a decade ago, acknowledging that no one predicted the scale and impact of COVID-19. The demand for testing surged exponentially, and Kingston had to coordinate with other testing centers across Ontario. Staff exhaustion and community skepticism added further challenges, but morale remained high. The lab's findings, including variant information, are reported to the province for surveillance and planning. Dr. Sheth is part of three labs closely involved with COVID-19 research, including the Molecular Microbiology Laboratory, the Infectious Disease Sequencing Lab, and the GIDRU lab at Queen's. Their contributions include one of Canada's first genomic analyses of COVID-19 and an Ontario-wide study. The team's future focus will likely include surveillance of respiratory viruses, influenza, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as flagged by the WHO as a growing threat.

Title: COVID-19 could be causing your ears to ring. Here’s what we know.
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the possible link between COVID-19 and tinnitus, a constant ringing or other noise in the ears. While the exact mechanism is not yet understood, some research suggests that COVID-19 may infect cells in the inner ear, leading to hearing problems. Additionally, stress and isolation during the pandemic may also be contributing factors. Several thousand cases of tinnitus have been reported post-vaccination, but experts emphasize that this is a rare occurrence and that the benefits of vaccination in protecting against severe illness and hospitalization outweigh the risks. Treatment options for tinnitus include corticosteroids, hearing aids, and cognitive behavioral therapy, but there is currently no cure. Managing tinnitus involves ruling out underlying health conditions and finding ways to distract from the noise, such as through sound therapy.
