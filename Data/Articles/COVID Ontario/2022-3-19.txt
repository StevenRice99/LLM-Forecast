Title: COVID-19 hasn't gone anywhere in Canada — and we could still see another surge
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. 
Key values: 
Current hospitalization rates (approximately 4,000 Canadians are currently hospitalized with COVID-19)
Projected hospital occupancy based on wastewater surveillance data (expected to rise, though not to the same levels as earlier waves)
Presence of BA.2 subvariant (accounts for 22% of cases in Canada and expected to become dominant strain in coming weeks)
Estimated daily number of infections (15,000 to 20,000) based on wastewater data
Risk factors: low vaccination rates, crowded housing or multi-generational homes, and lower-income residents

Article 2 of 7
Title: Ontario reports 615 COVID-19 hospitalizations with 193 patients in ICU
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here's a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting:
Hospital admissions: 615 (with 193 patients in ICU)
Daily change in hospitalizations: dip from 644 the day before and 717 exactly one week ago
Percentage of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 symptoms: 44%
Number of ICU patients: down from 199 reported Thursday and 238 at this time last week

Title: City of Ottawa scrapping mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Relevant.
COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario are not directly related to this article, but the city of Ottawa is easing COVID-19 restrictions, aligning with provincial timelines.
Almost 98% of active city employees were vaccinated under a previous mandatory policy.
Unvaccinated staff working in non-high-risk settings will return to work on April 4.
High-risk setting workers (e.g., paramedics) still require vaccination.

Title: Hospitalization of Infants and Children Aged 0–4 Years with Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 — COVID-NET, 14 States, March 2020–February 2022
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This is a scientific article discussing the outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations in infants and young children during the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.
Here are some key findings from the study:
1. Hospitalization rates: The peak weekly hospitalization rate among infants and children aged 0-4 years was approximately five times higher during the Omicron predominance (14.5 per 100,000) compared to Delta predominance (2.9 per 100,000).
2. Age-specific hospitalization rates: Infants under 6 months had a peak hospitalization rate that was about six times higher during Omicron than Delta predominance.
3. ICU admission rates: Monthly ICU admission rates were approximately three and a half times higher during the Omicron predominance peak (10.6 per 100,000) compared to the Delta predominance peak (3.0 per 100,000).
4. Underlying medical conditions: During Omicron predominance, 37% of hospitalized infants and children had one or more underlying medical condition.
5. RSV codetections: The proportion of infants and children with RSV codetections was significantly higher during Delta predominance (20%) compared to Omicron predominance (7%).
6. Hospital length of stay and ICU admission: Hospital length of stay was shorter, and the proportion requiring ICU admission was lower during Omicron predominance compared to Delta predominance.
7. Infants under 6 months: This age group accounted for a higher proportion of hospitalized infants and children, with 58% being under 2 months old.
Some additional details that might be relevant:
The study analyzed data from the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) during March 1, 2020-February 19, 2022.
The authors used SAS software to analyze the data and performed statistical tests using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and chi-square tests.
A total of 2,562 infants and children with complete clinical data were included in the analysis, representing 97% of all hospitalized patients during the study period.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Increased risk of needing intensive care (OR 2.13), invasive ventilation (OR 2.59) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 2.02) for pregnant patients with COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant patients.
Inflationary changes in the decidua and placenta associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia (OR 1.6).
Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants occurs at a rate of up to 7.7% as detected by Spike-specific IgM in cord blood.

Title: Canada Eases Covid Test Rule For Vaccinated Travelers
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False

"FALSE"
There is no mention of COVID-19 cases or hospitalization rates in Ontario, Canada, which makes this article irrelevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in that region.

Article 7 of 7
Title: Parents with kids under age 5 feel 'left behind' with ending of mask mandates
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Removing mask mandates on March 21 could lead to increased cases among children under five (too young to be vaccinated) and their caregivers.
This population may not adhere to mitigation measures as strictly, potentially leading to more cases and hospitalizations.
The province's decision is based on improving health indicators such as a stable test positivity rate and declining hospitalizations.
