The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, with increased social isolation and anxiety leading to a heightened risk of suicide. Access to firearms for those in distress can be particularly lethal, with a high fatality rate for suicide attempts involving guns. Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) are vital in preventing gun suicides, and their importance is highlighted during the pandemic as some states see an increase in calls to suicide hotlines. ERPOs allow law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. Several states have recognized the continued need for ERPOs during the pandemic, adapting policies to ensure their availability. As of April 2020, 17 states and Washington, DC, have extreme risk laws in effect, and many states have designated ERPOs as essential court proceedings, allowing them to continue despite court operation disruptions. To facilitate access to ERPOs and maintain public safety, courts are encouraged to classify ERPOs as essential proceedings and permit remote filing and hearings. This adaptation ensures that individuals can still seek protection for themselves or loved ones while adhering to social distancing measures. Resources are available for those in crisis, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741). These services provide free and confidential support for individuals in distress, offering a vital lifeline during the pandemic.Overall, the article emphasizes the continued need for suicide prevention measures, particularly regarding firearm access, during the COVID-19 pandemic. ERPOs play a critical role in this effort, and adaptations by courts and policymakers help ensure their accessibility and effectiveness in protecting vulnerable individuals.

Title: How we fail black patients in pain
Publisher: AAMC
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the disturbing findings that many medical students and residents hold false beliefs about racial differences in pain sensitivity and physiology, which can lead to disparities in pain treatment. The author, an anesthesiologist and professor of medicine, argues that these disparities are not intentional but rather the result of complex influences, including implicit biases that providers may not even be aware of. The article outlines steps that individuals and institutions can take to address these biases and improve equity in pain treatment, including collecting data on pain management by patient race, ethnicity, and other characteristics, identifying and addressing personal biases, implementing educational programs, and using clinical guidelines and standardized checklists to reduce individual discretion in pain management. The author also highlights the need to continue searching for objective measures of pain to reduce the influence of hidden biases.

Title: COVID-19 has caused a rise in hot dog sales
Publisher: Supermarket Perimeter
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Hot dog sales have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales in mid-March 2020 up over 120% compared to the same period in 2019. While sales have since leveled off, they remain elevated, with a 29% increase in sales for the week ending April 19. Beef hot dogs, which account for 60% of all hot dog sales, saw the biggest growth during this week, with a 36% increase. Non-beef hot dogs also saw a rise in sales, though at a lower rate of 18%. Consumers are purchasing hot dogs in various package sizes, with larger packages performing well during the outbreak. The sales data suggests that people are stocking up on hot dogs, which could be due to their long shelf life and versatility as an easy meal option during times of uncertainty and increased at-home dining. This trend may also be indicative of a broader increase in meat purchases as people shift towards more at-home cooking and away from dining out.

Title: Could llama antibodies treat viruses like COVID-19?
Publisher: Understanding Animal Research
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the potential of using antibodies, specifically nanobodies from llamas, as a treatment for COVID-19. Here is a summary, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations:The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global search for effective treatments.The body's immune system, particularly antibodies, is a key focus area for researchers. Antibodies can recognize and neutralize pathogens like viruses.Nanobodies, found in llamas, are smaller than conventional antibodies and have the potential to be more effective as they can reach targets that larger antibodies cannot.Researchers are hoping to find a potent virus-fighting antibody that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The use of nanobodies could also lead to the development of new synthetic drugs for other diseases like cancer and arthritis.The FDA approved the first nanobody-based drug last year, and researchers are now working on using nanobodies from llamas to target the coronavirus.An update added to the article on May 11 mentions that researchers from the University of Texas at Austin have found that antibodies from a llama can neutralize the coronavirus by binding to its spike protein and preventing it from entering host cells.The group plans to conduct preclinical research in animals before moving on to human clinical trials.While this research is promising and may lead to effective treatments for COVID-19 and other diseases, it is important to note that the development and testing process takes time. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations would depend on various factors, including the availability and effectiveness of treatments, vaccination rates, and the emergence of new variants. However, the progress in nanobody research could potentially contribute to improved treatment options and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
