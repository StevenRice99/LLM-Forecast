Title: UBC researchers develop biodegradable medical mask for COVID-19
Publisher: UBC News
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) have designed a new type of N95 mask, called the Canadian-Mask or Can-Mask, which is made entirely from local wood fibres sourced from British Columbia, such as pine, spruce, and cedar. The mask is designed to address the global shortage of medical-grade masks, which has impacted healthcare professionals' ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Can-Mask is intended to be fully compostable and biodegradable, addressing the environmental concerns associated with the use of synthetic masks. It also aims to improve supply lines by using local materials and manufacturing, reducing reliance on international sources that can be disrupted during a pandemic. The mask has two prototypes: one using a commercial N95 filter and the other using a filter designed by the UBC team from wood-based products. Both are being tested to meet health industry standards, with plans to seek Health Canada certification. The development of the Can-Mask involved a multidisciplinary team from UBC's faculties of applied science, forestry, and science. The researchers believe that their mask is a promising solution not only for pandemic response but also for stimulating the local and Canadian economies and creating jobs. While the article does not provide specific data or models to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the development of the Can-Mask and its potential to improve the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare professionals can indirectly impact hospitalization rates. Adequate PPE supplies can help ensure that healthcare facilities can safely treat COVID-19 patients and manage the pandemic more effectively, potentially reducing the strain on hospitals.

Title: New Carleton Study Finds COVID—19 Conspiracies and Misinformation Spreading Online
Publisher: Carleton Newsroom
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
A recent survey by Carleton University's School of Journalism and Communication reveals that nearly half of Canadians believe in at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory, with 26% subscribing to the idea that COVID-19 is a bioweapon engineered in a Chinese lab, and 11% believing it is a cover-up for the harmful effects of 5G technology. Additionally, many Canadians overestimate their ability to discern conspiracy theories from facts, which experts warn can lead to misinformation spreading quickly and posing a significant risk to public health communication. Younger individuals are more susceptible to believing conspiracy theories, and those who do tend to spend more time on social media. To combat this, experts recommend that scientists and public health experts actively engage with the public and provide accessible, accurate, and shareable information about COVID-19. The first phase of the survey was conducted with 2,000 Canadian residents, with a margin of error of +/2.19%.

Title: Data linking race and health predicts new COVID-19 hotspots
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black, racialized, and immigrant communities in Canada and how their vulnerabilities may have been overlooked by government officials. Here is a summary, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Anecdotal evidence suggests that these communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with higher infection and death rates. However, the lack of data collection on race and the assumption that Canada's universal health care and multiculturalism policy protect these groups have led to their exclusion from vulnerable population lists. By combining COVID-19 data with census information, the research team found that health regions with a higher percentage of Black and foreign-born residents had significantly higher infection rates. This helped explain why cities like Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver emerged as COVID-19 epicenters. The study also revealed that communities with a higher proportion of residents over 65 years old tended to have higher COVID-19 death rates, consistent with the known higher lethality of the virus in older adults. To gain a more localized understanding, the researchers subdivided health regions and identified potential COVID-19 hotspots, including Black and immigrant communities like Hamilton, Vancouver, and Montreal, as well as areas with large numbers of temporary migrant workers, such as the oilsands in northeast Alberta and mining sites in western Quebec. The findings highlight the need for individual-level data and more localized information to effectively direct resources and contain the virus's spread. They also underscore the importance of recognizing the vulnerabilities of Black and immigrant communities to avoid exacerbating inequality and health disparities. The exclusion of these groups from "vulnerable populations" in policy actions, such as Ontario's COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People, risks overlooking their higher risks of infection and death. Overall, the article emphasizes the need to address inequality and racial disparities exacerbated by the pandemic to ensure equitable health outcomes for all Canadians. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, some critical facts to consider include: Infection Rates: Health regions with a higher percentage of Black and foreign-born residents had significantly higher COVID-19 infection rates. This information can help identify communities at higher risk of outbreaks and guide targeted prevention measures. Demographics: Communities with a higher proportion of older residents tend to have higher COVID-19 death rates. This knowledge can inform resource allocation and preparedness in regions with an aging population. Hotspots: Identifying potential COVID-19 hotspots, such as areas with crowded living conditions (e.g., temporary migrant worker accommodations) or geographic proximity to high-infection areas, can help anticipate surges in hospitalizations. Inequality and Racial Disparities: Recognizing the vulnerabilities of Black and immigrant communities is crucial. Disproportionate infection and death rates in these groups may be indicative of underlying social and economic inequalities that need to be addressed to mitigate future health consequences. Individual-level Data: Collecting individual-level data on COVID-19 patients, including their racial and demographic information, is essential for understanding the disease's spread and impact on different communities. By incorporating these facts and continuing to monitor infection rates, demographics, and emerging hotspots, public health officials can better forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and develop targeted interventions to protect vulnerable communities.

Title: Canada’s COVID-19 blind spots on race, immigration and labour
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential roles played by low-paid and precarious workers in industries such as sanitation, healthcare, and food supply, who are often women, recent immigrants, and racialized Canadians. These workers face exploitative labor practices that contribute to the spread of the virus. Recent immigrants and racialized minorities, such as Filipinos and Sudanese Dinka, are at a higher risk of negative health outcomes, especially those working in meat-packing plants in Alberta. However, Canada lacks sufficient data on the social determinants of health for racialized minorities. There have been calls for collecting disaggregated data on COVID-19, health, and race, and some provincial jurisdictions are considering collecting more demographic data. The article argues that it is important to collect data on immigration status during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond. While people of color are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, not all racialized Canadians are equally vulnerable. Marginalized groups face barriers in accessing and benefiting from public services. Longitudinal data that intersects factors such as gender, age, education, income, race, and immigration profiles is needed to help policymakers understand the pathways and structures that create hierarchies of vulnerabilities within racialized and newcomer communities. This data will enable public health officials to work with stakeholders to eliminate institutional barriers to health equity. The intersection of race, gender, immigration, labor, and public health has shaped disparities in COVID-19 infection rates in Quebec, where healthcare workers account for 20% of infections, and racialized women, mostly Black and Maghrebi, make up 80% of aides in long-term care facilities. Similar issues are seen in Alberta, where over 1200 COVID-19 cases were linked to the Cargill meat plant, with 70% of employees of Filipino descent. Public health officials attributed the spread to carpooling and crowded living arrangements, but overlooked labor practices and socioeconomic conditions. Temporary foreign workers are also at risk, as they often work long hours, live in unsanitary conditions, and are reluctant to speak out due to precarious employment and residency status. The article concludes by calling for long-term changes to what is considered health-relevant demographic data. It emphasizes the need for engagement between public health officers, immigration and labor policymakers, and relevant stakeholders to develop robust social and labor protections for racial minorities, newcomers, and migrants.

Title: The changing nature of audit evidence arising from COVID-19
Publisher: CPA Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, auditors are facing challenges in planning and executing their work because of restricted access, limited travel, and reduced personnel. As a result, they are reassessing their procedures to address risks, including fraud, and the need for more persuasive evidence as risk increases. Auditors must maintain professional skepticism when evaluating evidence, especially in areas that were previously routine, such as confirming source documents or attending inventory counts. Specific considerations include increased supervision, assessing the reliability of electronic evidence, understanding how individual auditors' approaches have changed, and adapting group audit methods when physical access is restricted. Firm leaders should monitor workloads, keeping in mind the impact of increased home responsibilities on capacity. The pandemic provides an opportunity to rethink auditing practices, and collaboration between regulators, standard-setters, and practitioners is key to identifying issues and solutions.

Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The first clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine in Canada will be conducted by Dalhousie University researchers, with the goal of starting testing in the next few weeks. The Canadian Center for Vaccinology, based at Dalhousie, will lead the trials after receiving Health Canada approval. The trials aim to assess the safety and immune response of the vaccine, first in younger adults (18-55) and then older adults (65-85+). The initial tests will be intensive in monitoring and will involve healthy individuals. The vaccine, Ad5-nCoV, is a genetically modified adenovirus carrying a spike protein specific to COVID-19 to help the body identify and destroy the virus. If successful, the National Research Council will work to produce and distribute the vaccine in Canada. The intellectual property rights remain with the Chinese manufacturer, CanSino Biologics, but the NRC's involvement ensures a guaranteed domestic supply for Canada. This trial is a pivotal moment for research and innovation, with potential life-changing impacts worldwide.

Title: Not so ready-to-pick: Canadian growers left hanging by COVID-19
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the agricultural sector in Ontario and British Columbia, causing a shortage of seasonal agricultural workers and threatening the harvest of various crops. The pandemic imposed travel restrictions and safety regulations that delayed or prevented workers from arriving, with some growers in Ontario having only half their usual workforce. This has led to concerns about leaving crops unharvested, resulting in significant financial losses. The situation is similar in British Columbia, where the cherry and apple harvests may be affected. The shortage of workers is due to both the pandemic and the nature of the work, which is physically demanding and requires stamina and dexterity. The federal government has implemented measures to support the agriculture industry, including expedited visa processing and diplomatic interventions to facilitate charter flights for workers. However, visa processing remains a challenge, particularly in Mexico, which provides half of Canada's seasonal agricultural workers. As a result, arrivals in May remain uncertain, with only about one-third of the typical number of workers expected. The lack of pickers is estimated to cost billions in lost sales, and growers are concerned about the potential impact on their businesses and the industry as a whole.
