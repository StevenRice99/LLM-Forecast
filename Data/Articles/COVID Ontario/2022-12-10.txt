This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the current strain on the healthcare system in Ontario and other parts of Canada due to an early and severe flu season, particularly among children. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: The flu season has started early and is overwhelming emergency departments, with a high number of pediatric hospitalizations (over 700 children hospitalized with the H3N2 strain of the flu up to the end of November). The number of RSV hospitalizations is stabilizing, but there is still a significant burden of disease requiring complex hospitalization.

Health officials are warning of the importance of vaccination and education to combat misinformation on social media. These points suggest that the current flu season is putting a significant strain on the healthcare system in Ontario, which could impact the ability to respond to a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. The article highlights the need for targeted funding and resources to support children's hospitals and staffing, as well as the importance of vaccination and public education efforts.
