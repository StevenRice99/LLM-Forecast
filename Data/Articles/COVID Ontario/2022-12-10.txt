Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: An audit report from Alberta's auditor general revealed that thousands of small and medium-sized businesses may have received COVID-19 relief funds despite being ineligible. The report questioned the eligibility of recipients of the Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant Program (SMERG), which provided $670 million to businesses affected by public health orders and revenue losses due to the pandemic. The audit reviewed a sample of approved applications and found that 52% were ineligible for the grant, resulting in an overpayment of more than $5 million. The report criticized the province's focus on distributing money quickly rather than thoroughly verifying eligibility. The minister of jobs, economy, and northern development defended the rapid distribution, citing the urgency of supporting businesses during the pandemic. The audit also noted long wait times and a lack of transparency in the grant distribution process. The auditor general emphasized the need for better reporting on the achievements of COVID-19 relief programs, not just the amount spent. The report's findings highlight concerns about the management of COVID-19 relief funds and the potential impact on businesses truly in need of support. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider various factors, including vaccination rates, the severity of the virus strain, and adherence to public health measures. While the audit report does not directly provide data on hospitalizations, it indicates the economic impact of the pandemic on small and medium-sized businesses, which could indirectly influence hospitalization rates. By understanding the financial challenges faced by businesses and the support they require, governments can implement targeted measures to mitigate economic hardships. This, in turn, can help reduce the strain on healthcare systems by preventing business closures, job losses, and associated mental health issues, all of which could contribute to hospitalizations for various health conditions, including COVID-19. Therefore, while the audit report does not provide direct data for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, it highlights the need for effective relief programs and transparent reporting, which can indirectly influence the healthcare system's capacity and resources.

Title: Ontario pharmacists allowed to prescribe Paxlovid for COVID-19 treatment
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Ontario government announced that pharmacists in the province will be authorized to directly prescribe Paxlovid, an antiviral medication for treating COVID-19, to patients with a positive test, starting December 12. This change aims to increase accessibility and reduce the burden on healthcare facilities by preventing severe symptoms and hospitalizations. Paxlovid is recommended for individuals aged 60 and above or adults aged 18 and older who are immunocompromised or at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications. The medication is taken orally within the first five days of experiencing symptoms and will be provided to patients at no cost. However, the implementation depends on individual pharmacy decisions, and patients are advised to confirm with their local pharmacies. This strategy is expected to enhance Ontarians' access to timely treatment and potentially contribute to more effective COVID-19 hospitalization management.

Title: Cochrane review of COVID-19 vaccines shows they are effective
Publisher: Cochrane
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The review of 41 randomized controlled trials of 12 different COVID-19 vaccines involving 433,838 people found that most vaccines reduced the risk of infection and severe or critical illness caused by the virus. The vaccines with strong evidence of reducing the risk of infection were Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, CureVac, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sputnik V, Sinopharm, Bharat (Covaxin), Novavax, and Soberana 2. The vaccines that reduced or likely reduced the risk of severe disease were Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, Sputnik V, Bharat, and Novavax. The Janssen and Soberana 2 vaccines also likely reduced the risk of death from any cause. The review also found that localized and temporary side effects such as tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea were more common in vaccinated individuals compared to those unvaccinated or given a placebo. However, the rare side effects of thrombosis were inconsistently reported and rarely occurred in the trials. The researchers suggest that future research should compare new vaccines to those already in use, as they question the ethics of further placebo-controlled trials given the proven efficacy of the vaccines. This review provides valuable insight into the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and can help inform decisions about vaccination programs and policies.

Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article describes a research project conducted by McGill University researchers who used AI to analyze and compare simulated news coverage of COVID-19 with actual reporting by CBC. The findings suggest that the CBC's coverage differed significantly from the AI's perspective, with a greater focus on personalities and geo-politics, and a more positive tone despite the ongoing health crisis. This research highlights the potential for AI to identify biases in news reporting and provide insights that may be missed by human analysis alone. Furthermore, the team is optimistic about the potential for AI to be used not only to understand past human behavior but also to anticipate future actions, such as forecasting political or judicial outcomes, and even COVID-19 hospitalizations. The researchers acknowledge the presence of bias in AI but believe that understanding and interpreting this bias can provide valuable insights into human expression and decision-making processes.

Publisher: CP24
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The Canadian government's auditor general, Karen Hogan, released a report assessing the delivery and impact of COVID-19 benefit programs. While the programs provided quick relief to workers and employers, resulting in a national economic rebound, there were issues with overpayments and a lack of proper verification. Hogan estimates $4.6 billion was paid to ineligible individuals, and an additional $27.4 billion in payments require further investigation. The Canada Revenue Agency has only recovered $2.3 billion through voluntary repayments, indicating a need for improved efforts to recover overpayments. The report also highlighted data gaps, particularly regarding the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program. The program's effectiveness in helping businesses stay afloat and rehiring employees is uncertain due to limited data collection. The auditor general has recommended improving overpayment collection and addressing data gaps, which the reviewed government organizations have accepted. This audit provides insight into the challenges of implementing large-scale benefit programs during a crisis and underscores the importance of proper verification and data collection to ensure the efficient and effective distribution of funds. Accurate data on business resilience and worker benefits is crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as it helps assess the economic impact and the ability of businesses to withstand pandemic-related disruptions.

Title: Canada 'unsuccessful' at limiting COVID-19 vaccine wastage, auditor general finds
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has been criticized by the country's auditor general for its failure to minimize COVID-19 vaccine waste, with millions of doses set to expire soon. The federal government successfully procured vaccines, but lacked an effective system to track and manage their usage. As a result, out of the 169 million doses purchased between December 2020 and May 2022, only 84 million were administered, leaving 85 million unused. Of these, 50.6 million were deemed surplus and offered for donation, but only 15.3 million were donated, while 13.6 million expired. The report estimates that as of May, Canada had 32.5 million doses worth $1 billion that may expire by the end of the year if not used or donated. The auditor general attributed the waste to delays in developing an IT planning system, "VaccineConnect," and the lack of finalized data-sharing agreements with provinces and territories, impacting PHAC's ability to predict supply needs and plan donations. The federal government is urged to address data-sharing gaps and reduce vaccine surplus by increasing donations. The Health Minister acknowledged the waste, attributing it mainly to AstraZeneca doses, and committed to reducing surplus. The opposition criticized the government for the waste and the failure of the "Vaccine Connect" contract, while also acknowledging the challenge of surplus shots due to advanced purchase agreements.

This article provides an overview of the development, distribution, and impact of COVID-19 vaccines globally. Here are the key points: COVID-19 vaccines go through rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness before approval for public use. More than thirty vaccines have been approved, and over thirteen billion doses were administered worldwide by the end of 2022. Countries like Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates have high immunization rates, while many African countries have vaccinated only small fractions of their populations. Children's access to COVID-19 vaccines is expanding, with China offering vaccines to children aged three and above and the U.S. vaccinating children as young as six months old. Traditional vaccines use dead or weakened virus molecules, while newer vaccines use viral genetic material (mRNA) or viral vectors to prompt an immune response. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has involved governments, international institutions, the private sector, and research institutions. The leading vaccines are mostly from firms in China, Russia, and the U.S., with mRNA vaccines being the most sought-after due to their consistent effectiveness in preventing serious illness. Vaccine development has been sped up by overlapping stages of research and focusing on new vaccine technologies. Treatments like remdesivir and dexamethasone have been developed or repurposed to reduce the severity and duration of COVID-19 illness. Oral antiviral treatments like Paxlovid and molnupiravir can be administered at home and have been authorized for emergency use. The challenge of making and distributing enough vaccines globally remains, with multilateral initiatives and governments investing in expanding production plants. Wealthy countries initially struck deals for their own vaccine supply, leading to inequitable distribution and concerns about vaccine nationalism. Global cooperation has increased, with efforts like COVAX and initiatives to waive patents for COVID-19 vaccines to scale up production. This article highlights the progress and challenges in the global effort to vaccinate against COVID-19. While vaccines have been developed and distributed at an unprecedented pace, ensuring equitable access and addressing new variants remain crucial to ending the pandemic.

Title: Severe COVID-19 is associated with molecular signatures of aging in the human brain
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the human brain, particularly the frontal cortex, using postmortem brain tissue specimens from individuals who died from COVID-19. The study includes individuals with no known psychiatric or neurological disorders, except for one person with epilepsy and another with Alzheimer's disease. The control group consisted of age and sex-matched individuals without COVID-19 or any known psychiatric or neurological conditions. The study used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze gene expression changes in the frontal cortex of individuals with COVID-19 compared to controls. They found that COVID-19 was associated with dysregulation of gene expression related to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Specifically, they identified upregulation of genes involved in microglial activation, astrocyte reactivity, and neuronal injury. They also found that the expression of interferon-stimulated genes was increased in individuals with COVID-19, suggesting a potential role for interferons in the brain's response to the virus. The study also compared the transcriptomic changes in the frontal cortex of individuals with COVID-19 to those in an independent group of individuals who had received intensive care unit (ICU) treatment or ventilator support but did not have COVID-19. They found that while there was some overlap in the gene expression changes between the two groups, there were also unique changes in the COVID-19 group, suggesting that the viral infection may have distinct effects on the brain. Additionally, the study explored the association between COVID-19 and brain aging by comparing transcriptomic changes in the frontal cortex of young and old individuals. They found that COVID-19-associated gene expression changes were correlated with aging-related gene expression patterns, suggesting that COVID-19 may accelerate brain aging or exacerbate age-related brain changes. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the observed gene expression changes by treating human primary neurons with interferons and cytokines. They found that interferon-beta and interferon-gamma treatment upregulated interferon-stimulated genes, while tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment induced neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative gene expression changes similar to those observed in COVID-19. In summary, this study provides insights into the impact of COVID-19 on the human brain, suggesting that the viral infection may contribute to neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and accelerated brain aging. The findings highlight the importance of further research to understand the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19 and to develop interventions to mitigate these effects.
