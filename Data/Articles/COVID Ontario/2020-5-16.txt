COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets released from the mouth or nose (WHO).
Contact with contaminated surfaces can also spread the virus if hands touch face, eyes, or nose.
Wearing disposable gloves in public does not provide extra protection against COVID-19 and may lead to false sense of reassurance (Chakrabarti).
Frequent hand washing is still the most important measure to prevent COVID-19 transmission (Kwong).
Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol is recommended by PHAC.
