Title: COVID-19 - Novel Coronavirus Facts frequently asked questions
Publisher: Canadian Red Cross
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article provides information on COVID-19, including its symptoms, transmission, protection measures, and the availability of vaccines and treatments. Here are the key points: COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified in late 2019. It is a new strain of virus that had not previously been found in humans. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include a new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, loss of smell or taste, headache, gastrointestinal issues, and feeling unwell. Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure. The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, shouts, or talks. It can also spread through close personal contact or by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face. Protection measures include following good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing and physical distancing. The Canadian Red Cross also recommends wearing a non-medical mask or face covering in public when physical distancing is not possible. Vaccines for COVID-19 are being administered across Canada, but it is important to continue following public health measures such as handwashing, physical distancing, and avoiding close contact with those showing symptoms. People of all ages can be infected by COVID-19, but older individuals and those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to severe illness. There are authorized treatments for COVID-19, and ongoing safety monitoring is being conducted by the Public Health Agency of Canada. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider factors such as the transmission rate of the virus, the effectiveness of protection measures, and the availability and uptake of vaccines and treatments. Monitoring local and regional trends in infection rates and hospitalizations can also help predict and prepare for potential surges in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

Title: The Health and Behavioural Impacts of COVID-19 on Youth: Results from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article presents findings from a Statistics Canada survey on the impacts of COVID-19 on the health, behavior, and activities of Canadian youth aged 15 to 30. Here's a summary, along with some important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: Canadian youth are more concerned about the health of vulnerable people and the potential overload on the healthcare system due to COVID-19 than they are about their own health. While youth express concern about the health of vulnerable populations and the capacity of the healthcare system, less than half worry about civil unrest or family stress due to confinement. The majority of youth engage in positive health behaviors, such as communicating with friends and family and exercising indoors or outdoors. Females are more likely than males to communicate with their social network and exercise indoors. Important Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: A significant portion of Canadian youth (87%) is very or extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the health of vulnerable people, indicating a high level of awareness about the risks faced by certain populations. Only about 21% of youth are very or extremely concerned about their own health, which could suggest a lower likelihood of youth hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The positive health behaviors exhibited by youth, such as regular exercise and social connection, could contribute to overall better health outcomes and lower hospitalization rates in this age group. The survey was conducted between March 29 and April 3, 2020, providing a snapshot of youth concerns and behaviors during the early stages of the pandemic. These findings provide insights into the perspectives and behaviors of Canadian youth during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be useful for public health officials and policymakers in forecasting hospitalization rates and developing targeted interventions for this age group.

Title: Depression in pregnant women and health care providers during COVID-19
Publisher: Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This article discusses a research project that aims to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women and healthcare providers in Anhui, China. The project is led by Dr. Shelby Yamamoto, an epidemiologist interested in environmental factors affecting vulnerable populations, and is based at the University of Alberta's School of Public Health. The research will assess the potential for depression among pregnant women and the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on their mental health. It will also examine potential adverse birth outcomes and measure anxiety among healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in perinatal healthcare during and after the pandemic. The study builds on an existing CIHR-funded project that started in 2018, implementing a perinatal depression screening and management program (PDSM) in four cities in Anhui. The PDSM program uses the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to screen for depression, offering internet-based CBT and individual counseling as needed. The COVID-19 study will capture changes in depression scores over time and conduct qualitative analyses to explore the impact of the pandemic on perinatal mental health. The research is currently recruiting women and HCPs, with plans to collect data longitudinally to assess changes in depression and anxiety trends and the impact of the Mom's Good Mood program. The team also aims to gather information about perinatal service use and birth outcomes during the pandemic, exploring links between adverse birth outcomes and depression. The project benefits from the diverse expertise of the Principal Investigators, including epidemiological analysis, psychological measurement, and global maternal and newborn care knowledge.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic: Financial impacts on postsecondary students in Canada
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This article discusses the financial concerns of post-secondary students in Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a Statistics Canada crowdsourcing survey completed by over 100,000 students. The analysis focuses on continuing students who participated after the announcement of the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) on April 22nd, which provided financial support to those ineligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Key findings include: Over two-thirds (70%) of continuing students were very or extremely concerned about the financial impacts of the pandemic, primarily using up their savings (61%) and increased debt (47%). Many students were anxious about covering current expenses and future tuition/accommodation costs, with over 40% very or extremely concerned about these issues. Doctoral students relying on research funding were particularly concerned (61%) about potential funding shortages. Students living alone or with roommates were more concerned about financial issues than those living with family. The pandemic disrupted academic work placements/courses for 60% of students and significantly impacted their employment plans. While the survey provides valuable insights, it's important to note that the results cannot be generalized to all post-secondary students in Canada due to the nature of crowdsourcing data collection.

Title: COVID-19's devastating toll on families in Montreal's poorest neighbourhoods
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article details the story of Marie Missoule Michaud, a resident of Montréal-Nord, whose partner, Sony Innocent, died from suspected COVID-19 complications. Montréal-Nord is a borough in Montreal, Canada, with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and a low-income population. Public health experts attribute the spread of the virus in these areas to several factors, including population density, a higher proportion of multigenerational families, and a larger number of residents working in essential jobs that expose them to the illness. The article also mentions the high percentage of healthcare workers among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Montreal, particularly in the hardest-hit boroughs. Dr. Nima Machouf, an epidemiologist, confirms that the contagion in long-term care institutions has spread to the surrounding neighborhoods where staff reside. As of the article's publication, Montreal has recorded over 20,000 cases and 2,100 deaths, leading to a halt in plans to reopen schools. The situation has brought attention to the "issue of inequality," with calls for increased testing, mask distribution, and measures to ensure physical distancing in vulnerable neighborhoods and populations. The article concludes with a personal note, describing Michaud and Innocent's relationship and how she is coping with her loss, with the support of her community. Key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Montreal, particularly the borough of Montréal-Nord, has a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a continuous rise and no immediate downturn. The virus has spread rapidly through poorer boroughs, while outbreaks in more affluent areas have been better contained. 19% of confirmed cases in Montreal are among healthcare workers, with a higher proportion in the hardest-hit boroughs (24% in Montréal-Nord). Population density, multigenerational households, and a high proportion of essential workers in low-income neighborhoods contribute to the spread. Increased testing, mask distribution, and physical distancing measures are recommended to mitigate the impact in vulnerable areas.

Title: Covid-19 Fueling Anti-Asian Racism and Xenophobia Worldwide
Publisher: Human Rights Watch
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Human Rights Watch has urged governments to take immediate action to prevent racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, including prosecuting racial attacks against Asians and people of Asian descent. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has also expressed concern over the increase in hate crimes, urging countries to "act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate." Since the pandemic began, there has been a rise in racist rhetoric and attacks against Asians and people of Asian descent worldwide. This includes physical attacks, violent bullying, threats, racist abuse, and discrimination. Several political parties and groups in countries like the US, UK, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, and Germany have contributed to this by spreading conspiracy theories that demonize minorities and immigrants. In the US, there have been numerous media reports of attacks and discrimination against Asians and Asian-Americans, with a coalition of Asian-American groups receiving almost 1,500 reports of incidents. Similar incidents have been reported in other countries like Italy, France, Australia, Russia, the UK, and Brazil. Some governments have imposed strict lockdowns that disproportionately impact foreign workers without providing necessary support, and there have been instances of discriminatory treatment of foreigners in countries like Malaysia and China. To address this issue, the UN has recommended that governments adopt "national action plans against racial discrimination," which include enhanced policing of hate crimes and public messaging campaigns that encourage tolerance. Human Rights Watch also emphasizes the importance of public education initiatives, stronger policing of hate crimes, and support for affected communities. Social media companies are also urged to take responsibility for protecting users from hateful content. Some country-specific cases are provided, highlighting the extent of the problem in the US, UK, Russia, Australia, India, and beyond. Overall, the article calls for urgent action to address the wave of Covid-19-related racism and xenophobia.

Title: Lower income people, new immigrants at higher COVID-19 risk in Toronto, data suggests
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: According to new data from Toronto Public Health, COVID-19 appears to be disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals and newcomers to Toronto. The data showed that the group with the highest percentage of people living below the poverty line had the highest rate of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Similarly, the group with the highest percentage of recent immigrants had the highest rates of cases and hospitalizations. These findings were supported by provincial data from the non-profit research institute ICES, which found that individuals in lower-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with a higher concentration of immigrants and visible minorities were more likely to be tested and confirmed positive for COVID-19. Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, emphasized that the "next normal" in the city will include physical distancing, and that easing public health measures will be a gradual process until a vaccine or effective treatment is available. She also recommended wearing face masks in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. As of the report, 622 people in Toronto had died from COVID-19, with a total of 7,775 cases. Dr. de Villa also addressed concerns about the health risk of acquiring COVID-19 from grocery store employees, stating that not all infections among store employees were acquired in the workplace due to community spread. She recommended regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in local businesses.

Title: Local food system responses to COVID-19: Toronto and its city region
Publisher: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Toronto, Canada's largest city, has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with businesses closed and residents asked to stay at home. The city's strong public health department, Toronto Public Health, has played a crucial role in managing the crisis. The food sector is a major source of jobs in Toronto, including the hospitality industry and food processing. Food availability in Toronto has remained relatively stable due to the Ontario Food Terminal (OFT) and Canada's supply management system. The OFT centrally warehouses most fresh food brought into the city, ensuring equitable access for various food outlets. Supply management matches production volumes to demand, protecting food security and family farming. These factors have prevented price spikes and food waste. However, there are concerns about the reliance on migrant labor in agriculture and the lack of oversight for their safety during the pandemic. Food insecurity has spiked in Toronto due to job losses in the food sector and other industries. Civil society organizations, food banks, and community initiatives have stepped up to address the increased need. The Toronto Food Policy Council, a unique hybrid model, has played a crucial role in convening and empowering various stakeholders. Efforts to reopen community gardens and farmers' markets have been successful, but farmers' markets remain closed. There are concerns that the closure may entrench a retail monopoly by supermarkets controlled by oligopolies. There is a growing call to buildbackbetter in Toronto, with various organizations promoting a progressive agenda for economic recovery. Initiatives include promoting green infrastructure, institutional support for local and sustainable food systems, and projects to enhance food production and access. The federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) is providing temporary income support to those affected by the pandemic, and there is growing support for a Guaranteed Annual Income. Toronto and its city region face challenges but also present an opportunity to test measures encouraging food localization for improved food security.

Publisher: Angus Reid Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Title: Canadian Children's Perspectives on the COVID-19 Pandemic Date: May 11, 2020 Main Points: A study by the Angus Reid Institute surveyed 650 children aged 10-17 in Canada about their experiences during the COVID-19 shutdown. The dominant emotion expressed by the children was boredom (71%), with a significant number also feeling normal (41%). Older teenagers were more likely to feel angry and lonely. Half of the children (54%) said they missed their friends the most during isolation, while 16% missed extracurricular activities. Screen time activities such as watching TV and playing video games were common ways to pass the time during isolation. Older teenagers also stayed connected through texting and social media. When asked about their worries, half of the children expressed concern about becoming sick, but they were more worried about their family members' health. The biggest concern for children was missing out on school, with 29% citing it as a major worry. Most children (75%) felt they were keeping up with online classes, but many disliked the arrangement (57%) and felt unmotivated (60%). Provincial approaches to returning to school vary, with some children looking forward to it (36%) and others feeling indifferent (38%) or not welcoming the prospect (26%). The article provides insights into how Canadian children have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shutdown. While they are statistically low-risk for the virus, their lives and education have been significantly disrupted. The study highlights the emotional and social impacts of isolation, as well as the challenges of online learning.
