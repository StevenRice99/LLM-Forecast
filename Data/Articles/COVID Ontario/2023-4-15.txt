TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the latest guidance on COVID-19 booster shots and the risk of severe illness and hospitalization among different populations. The article highlights the following values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 1. Vulnerable adults, such as seniors 65 and older, those living in congregate settings, and adults with compromised immune systems, are recommended to receive another round of booster shots starting this spring. 2. The general population is not recommended to rush out for another round of booster shots, but may still consider getting vaccinated if they haven't had a shot in the last year or if they have underlying health conditions. 3. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against severe outcomes, such as hospitalization and death, is higher and more durable than against symptomatic infection. 4. Hybrid immunity, which is the combination of prior vaccination and infection, offers strong protection against severe disease. 5. Personal risk levels can shift over time, and individuals should consider factors such as pregnancy, immunodeficiency, and underlying health conditions when deciding whether to get vaccinated. 6. Scientists expect COVID-19 vaccines to eventually be recommended at an annual interval for the broader population, assuming the virus settles into a more predictable, seasonal pattern. These values can inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, by taking into account the vaccination status and risk levels of different populations, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines against severe outcomes.
