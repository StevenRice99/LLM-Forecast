Title: Why most Canadians don't need another COVID-19 booster — at least not yet
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The latest public health guidance in Canada and internationally suggests that while vulnerable adults should receive a COVID-19 booster shot this spring, the general population does not need to rush for additional doses. This marks a shift in the global vaccination approach as community immunity has changed, with the majority of people now vaccinated, infected, or both. Canadian experts recommend a booster for adults over 65, those with compromised immune systems, and those in long-term care settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the expected approach in the US align with this, emphasizing boosters for high-risk groups while healthy children and teens may not require vaccination. The focus of global guidance remains on preventing severe illness, death, and hospitalizations. Vaccines provide durable protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes, and their effectiveness is higher against severe disease compared to infection, per studies. Bivalent vaccines, targeting Omicron subvariants, also lower the risk of severe infection with other Omicron family members. This "hybrid immunity" from vaccination and prior infection offers strong protection against severe disease. However, individuals' risk levels can change; pregnancy, for example, increases the risk of severe COVID-19. Scientists anticipate annual COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for the general population in the future, assuming the virus becomes seasonal. Lower-risk individuals who have not been vaccinated or infected recently should still consider a booster, as protection wanes over time and new variants may evade immune responses. The balance between public health priorities and individuals' desires for extra protection will be key in the future approach to COVID-19 vaccinations.

Title: COVID-19: Disease-induced (natural) immunity, vaccination or hybrid immunity?
Publisher: Nebraska Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers have been studying how the immune system responds to COVID-19 and vaccines, especially with the emergence of immune-evasive omicron subvariants. The article compares disease-induced immunity (from infection) and vaccination-induced immunity to determine which provides better protection. Initially, studies suggested that vaccine-induced immunity was more effective and lasted longer than natural immunity from infection. Disease-induced immunity can vary depending on the severity of the illness, and some people may have a stronger antibody response than others. However, the latest studies indicate that both types of immunity offer benefits. While disease-induced immunity can sometimes be longer-lasting, vaccine-induced immunity has fewer risks and provides strong protection against severe illness and death. The best protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes is hybrid immunity, which is a combination of natural immunity and vaccination. A robust study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that hybrid immunity provided the most effective and long-lasting protection against omicron. The study showed that hybrid immunity offered 97% protection against hospitalization or severe disease at 12 months after the primary vaccine series and 95% protection at six months after the first booster shot. In contrast, previous infection alone provided 74% protection against hospital admission or severe illness at 12 months, with effectiveness against reinfection waning to 24%. The article emphasizes that COVID-19 still poses a risk, with approximately 300 deaths per day in the United States. It recommends staying alert, practicing healthy habits, and keeping up to date with vaccine boosters, especially for those at higher risk of serious illness. The protection offered by previous infections does not eliminate the need for vaccination. Infection-induced immunity wanes quickly, and vaccination enhances and prolongs protection. The bottom line is that individuals who have had COVID-19 should still get vaccinated and boosted to achieve the most robust immunity.

Here is a summary of the article: Title: Canada's promise to produce millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses hasn't materialized, but progress is being made In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that Canada's National Research Council would produce millions of vaccine doses by the end of 2021. Nearly 1,000 days later, this has not come to fruition, but there are signs of progress. While Canada initially lacked the biomanufacturing capacity to produce its own vaccines, the government has since invested over $1.3 billion in 12 new or expanded plants for vaccine and antibody treatment production. Most of these facilities are still under construction, but a few are close to completion and will significantly boost Canada's annual vaccine production capacity. The National Research Council's new Biologics Manufacturing Centre is one of the few facilities ready to produce vaccines, but it hasn't had a vaccine to produce. The centre had an agreement with Novavax, but the company's future is uncertain. Other companies, such as BioVectra and Moderna, are also expanding their production capacity in Canada. Moderna's new plant in Laval is expected to start producing doses by the end of 2024 or early 2025, with an annual capacity of up to 100 million doses. AbCellera Biologics is also constructing a new manufacturing site for antibody therapies, with the first clinical batches expected in 2025. However, there is concern over the future of Medicago's manufacturing site in Quebec City, which received funding from the Canadian government, as the company is facing closure. Overall, while Canada has yet to reach its goal of domestic vaccine production, significant strides have been made to improve its biomanufacturing capacity and reduce reliance on imported vaccines. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, as well as their uptake by the population. The progress made in Canada's vaccine production and the expected increase in supply can positively impact hospitalization rates by ensuring more people have access to vaccines and booster shots. However, it is also crucial to monitor the emergence of new variants and the durability of vaccine protection over time.

Title: Improving Ventilation in Your Home
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article provides guidance on how to use portable HEPA cleaners to improve indoor air quality and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Here are the key points: Portable HEPA cleaners can be used to improve filtration and reduce particles in the air, which is especially important if you don't have an HVAC system or if you want to enhance your existing system. When choosing a HEPA cleaner, select one that is appropriately sized for the room or rooms where you plan to use it. Consider the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of the HEPA cleaner. Choose a model with a CADR that meets or exceeds the square footage of the room(s) it will be used in. A higher CADR means faster air cleaning. The EPA's Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home offers more detailed information on selecting and using portable HEPA cleaners. While this article focuses on the use of HEPA cleaners to improve indoor air quality, it is important to note that forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations involves a range of additional factors, including vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, social distancing measures, and the capacity of healthcare facilities. However, improving indoor air quality through the use of HEPA cleaners can be one part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce COVID-19 transmission and mitigate the impact on healthcare systems.

Title: Millions of COVID-19 doses to expire this year in Canada. How will they be used? - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: According to data, approximately 19 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada are at risk of expiring by the end of 2023. The federal government's inventory includes 16.8 million doses with 2023 expiry dates, while provinces and territories hold over eight million doses, with over two million doses expiring soon. The actual number is likely higher as some regions did not disclose expiration details. The Public Health Agency of Canada aims to optimize vaccine supply management and reduce waste, considering options like additional booster campaigns, donations to developing nations, or expiry extensions if vaccines remain effective. A fall booster campaign for the general population is likely, but the current NACI recommendations target vulnerable groups. Canada's inventory includes 6.7 million bivalent doses, and health officials emphasize the need for non-bivalent vaccines for initial vaccinations and young children. Canada is prepared to donate surplus doses, but lower-income countries' demand and administration capacity have shifted. Donated vaccines typically require a six-month shelf life, adding urgency to distribution efforts. Canada has already donated over 25 million doses to 30 countries. To minimize waste, manufacturers can extend expiry dates with Health Canada approval, as stability testing confirms the vaccines' effectiveness beyond the original expiry. Despite efforts, some waste is expected due to the challenges of pandemic management and vaccine uptake.

Title: Three Years Later, Covid-19 Is Still a Health Threat. Journalism Needs to Reflect That
Publisher: Nieman Reports
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article criticizes the media for its inconsistent and biased coverage of COVID-19, particularly in its failure to adequately convey the risks associated with the virus and its impact on vulnerable communities. The piece argues that the media has contributed to a narrative that pathologizes those who remain cautious about COVID-19 and promotes an individualistic approach to public health that fails to consider the needs of at-risk individuals. Key points from the article include: The media's failure to include perspectives from at-risk communities, such as disabled, low-income, people of color, and elderly individuals, in COVID-19 coverage. The media's reliance on medical doctors who are often not trained in public health as sources for COVID-19 stories, leading to inaccurate predictions and recommendations. The push for a return to "normalcy" and the characterization of those who remain cautious as extreme or communist, even as new variants and surges continue to emerge. The failure to accurately convey the risks of long COVID and the growing list of health problems associated with the virus. The media's focus on death rates and hospital capacity while neglecting the wider public health impact of COVID-19, including chronic illnesses and lost wages. The article concludes by emphasizing the responsibility of journalists to convey the nuances of the COVID-19 pandemic and to hold power accountable while representing the needs of diverse perspectives. It highlights the need for a more inclusive and scientifically accurate approach to COVID-19 coverage.

Title: Policies In The Pandemic: Covid-19 Does Not Constitute Property Damage
Publisher: Clark Wilson LLP
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a court case, Sir Corp. v. Aviva, where the Ontario Superior Court ruled that COVID-19 did not cause "direct physical loss or damage" to property, and therefore business interruption claims related to the pandemic were not covered by property insurance policies. This decision aligns with similar rulings in the US and Australia, reinforcing the requirement for physical alteration or damage to trigger coverage. The court emphasized the need to interpret the policy as a whole, including endorsements, and concluded that the COVID-19 virus did not meet the physical element required for coverage. This case provides clarity for insurers and reinforces the understanding of "direct physical loss or damage" in property policies. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors are important to consider: 1. Previous waves and trends: Analyzing past waves of the pandemic can provide insights into hospitalization patterns and help identify potential triggers or warning signs. 2. Infection rates: Monitoring infection rates, including the number of new cases and the positivity rate of tests, can help predict the potential demand for hospitalizations. A surge in infections may lead to a higher number of hospitalizations, especially if a more severe variant is circulating. 3. Vaccination rates: The percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated, as well as the rate of booster doses, can impact the severity of infections and reduce the likelihood of hospitalizations. Higher vaccination rates may help mitigate the strain on healthcare systems. 4. Hospital capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators is crucial in managing COVID-19 patients. Tracking hospital capacity can help identify potential hotspots or regions at risk of being overwhelmed. 5. Demographics: Considering the age and health of the population can provide insights into potential risk factors. Older individuals or those with underlying health conditions are more likely to experience severe illness and require hospitalization. 6. Public health measures: The effectiveness of public health measures, such as social distancing, mask mandates, and travel restrictions, can impact the spread of the virus and influence hospitalization rates. 7. Wastewater surveillance: Monitoring wastewater for the presence of COVID-19 can provide early warning signs of increasing infection rates in a community, allowing for proactive planning and resource allocation. 8. Seasonal factors: COVID-19 hospitalizations may vary with the seasons, as respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily during colder months when people spend more time indoors. 9. Healthcare staffing: Adequate healthcare staffing is critical to managing hospitalizations. A shortage of healthcare workers can impact the ability to provide care and may affect hospitalization rates. 10. New variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can significantly impact hospitalization forecasts. Variants with higher transmissibility or increased severity can lead to a rapid increase in hospitalizations. By considering these factors and utilizing data-driven models, public health officials and healthcare providers can better forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and allocate resources effectively.

Title: Obesity and COVID-19 mortality are correlated
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article examines the link between obesity and COVID-19 mortality across different countries. Obesity is a global health concern, with a significant number of men and women classified as obese worldwide. While the relationship between obesity and increased risk of COVID-19 death is not fully understood, there are several clinical explanations for this correlation. Obese individuals may experience a higher volume and extended duration of viral shedding, leading to greater exposure and worse outcomes. This is supported by several studies that indicate a lower likelihood of survival for obese COVID-19 patients. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 mortality and obese adult populations reveals a pattern: high-income countries, where obesity rates are typically higher, tend to have higher COVID-19 mortality, while lowand lower-middle-income countries with lower obesity rates have accounted for a smaller percentage of COVID-19 deaths. This article contributes to the limited number of formal analyses exploring the correlation between obesity rates and COVID-19 mortality across nations. It highlights the need to consider obesity as a critical factor in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and emphasizes the importance of reevaluating public policy in light of this relationship.

Publisher: Dal News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of residents in long-term care homes, as presented in a chapter co-authored by Dr. Caitlin McArthur in the e-book "COVID-19, Frontline Responders, and Mental Health." Dr. McArthur, an expert in rehabilitation for people with chronic health conditions, particularly in home and long-term care, notes that the pandemic's effect on mental health and quality of life in these settings has been mixed, with some studies showing increased mental health concerns while others present modest increases or decreases. The pandemic exacerbated existing challenges in long-term care homes, such as lockdowns, fear of infections, staff shortages, and communication barriers due to personal protective equipment. However, it also prompted the development and testing of creative strategies to mitigate the negative mental health consequences. These strategies included technology-supported visits, increased volunteer access, and enhanced family support. The chapter emphasizes the importance of mental health and quality of life for long-term care residents to ensure they can enjoy their remaining months or years as fully as possible. Overall, the e-book explores the pandemic's impact on responder health across various sectors and highlights the inequitable impacts on vulnerable populations and workforce sectors.
