Title: What you need to know about COVID-19 in Ottawa for the week of March 21
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article provides several pieces of information relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points include: 1. Ontario has lifted its mask mandate for many indoor settings, which could lead to an increase in cases and hospitalizations. 2. The vaccination rate in Ontario is good, but experts are warning about the risks of a more transmissible subvariant. 3. Ottawa's average coronavirus wastewater level is rising quickly, which could indicate an increase in cases and hospitalizations. 4. There are currently 9 Ottawa residents in local hospitals for treatment of active COVID-19, with 1 needing intensive care. 5. The wider region has about 50 COVID-19 hospitalizations, with 15 patients needing intensive care. 6. The article mentions that hospitalizations and wastewater trends can help fill in the picture of COVID-19 trends, as testing strategies have changed under the Omicron variant. 7. Officials expect numbers to trend up as rules loosen, but the key is whether the increases become concerning. 8. Vaccination rates in eastern Ontario range from 80 to 92% for eligible residents with at least two doses, and 58 to 70% for adults with a third dose. These points suggest that while vaccination rates are good, the lifting of mask mandates and rising wastewater levels could lead to an increase in cases and hospitalizations in Ontario. However, the current hospitalization numbers are relatively low, and officials are monitoring the situation closely.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The West End Urgent Care Clinic in Hamilton, which was closed due to a surge in hospitalizations during the Omicron wave, is set to resume normal operations on March 24. The clinic's closure was due to an influx of patients requiring admission to acute wards and staffing shortages during the Omicron surge. As of March 23, the city's two hospital networks reported under 50 COVID cases combined, including fewer than five people in ICUs. The city's medical officer of health, Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, says that COVID case numbers and hospitalizations are "well down" in Hamilton, and that the easing of mask mandates is "reasonable" at this point. The latest Scarsin forecasting suggests that there will be a "small swell" of new COVID cases in the spring, with a worst-case scenario of 200 COVID-related hospitalizations between now and late May. Ontario reported 611 people in hospital with COVID on Wednesday, with 174 in intensive care, which is down by 28 for hospitalizations and a decrease of five in ICUs since the previous day. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Current hospitalization numbers: 611 people in hospital with COVID, 174 in intensive care Forecasted hospitalizations: 200 COVID-related hospitalizations between now and late May (worst-case scenario) Current ICU numbers: fewer than five people in ICUs in Hamilton Rate of institutional outbreaks: decreased to an ongoing average of five to 10 surges reported per day since mid-February.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here's a brief summary of the most important values for forecasting: The COVID-19 viral signal in Ottawa's wastewater is increasing, which typically precedes an increase in cases and hospitalizations. Current hospital levels in Ottawa are steady, with 8 people in local hospitals due to an active case of COVID-19, and 1 in intensive care. Ontario health officials reported 639 people being treated in Ontario hospitals with COVID-19, including 179 in intensive care. Ottawa's key COVID-19 statistics: + Cases per 100,000 (March 14 to 20): 57.6 (down from 58.3) + Positivity rate in the Ottawa community (excluding long-term care homes) (March 14 to 20): 17.5 per cent (up from 14.6 per cent) + Known active cases: 777 (-65) Vaccination rates in Ottawa: + Share of population five and older with at least one dose: 92 per cent + Share of population five and older fully vaccinated: 88 per cent + Share of population 12 and older with at least three doses: 61 per cent These values provide insight into the current state of COVID-19 in Ottawa and Ontario, including the increase in viral signal, hospitalization rates, and vaccination rates, which can be used to forecast future hospitalizations.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Hospitalizations at CHEO (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario) have increased recently, with 6-7 patients admitted with COVID-19 over the past weekend, up from 2 patients from March 3-12. 72% of all COVID-19 admissions at CHEO have occurred since December 1, 2021, matching the city-wide trend. COVID-19 patients have accounted for about 10% of all admissions during the Omicron wave, with only 33% of them admitted for COVID-19 as the primary reason. Ottawa's hospitalizations and other pandemic trends have generally stabilized in March at levels higher than they were before Omicron. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, particularly in the eastern region, may be increasing, and that the Omicron wave has had a significant impact on hospitalizations. This information can be used to inform forecasting models and predict future hospitalization trends.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The Ontario government has lifted its mask mandate, which may lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Students in Toronto are protesting the end of the mask mandate in schools, citing concerns about safety and the potential for increased transmission. The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, has stated that the decision to lift masking rules was made based on improving COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Masking requirements will remain in place for certain settings, such as public transit, long-term care, and healthcare settings. The Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board has decided to continue the mask mandate for two more weeks, despite the provincial order to lift it. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The lifting of the mask mandate may lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The number of schools and students participating in the walkout may indicate the level of concern and potential for increased transmission.

Title: COVID-19 hasn't gone anywhere in Canada — and we could still see another surge
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Canada has lifted most public health measures, but experts are concerned about a potential surge in cases and hospitalizations due to the spread of the Omicron subvariant BA.2. Hospitalization rates remain higher than at many points in the pandemic, with over 4,000 Canadians currently hospitalized for COVID-19. Wastewater data in Ontario shows a slight uptick in concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, indicating a potential increase in cases. The COVID-19 Science Advisory Table estimates the current daily number of infections in Ontario to be between 15,000 and 20,000 and expects hospital occupancy to rise. The BA.2 subvariant is expected to become the dominant strain in Canada in the coming weeks and is more contagious than its predecessors. Vaccination rates and prior infection may provide some protection against severe illness, but boosters are still necessary to prevent hospitalizations. Communities with lower vaccination rates, lower-income residents, and crowded housing are at higher risk of household transmission and dire outcomes. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they indicate a potential increase in cases and hospitalizations, particularly among vulnerable populations.
