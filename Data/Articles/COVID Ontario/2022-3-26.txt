Title: Proposed pathogenesis for stroke in patients with COVID-19
Publisher: Mayo Clinic
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Here is a summary of the article: A recent Mayo Clinic study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes in 2022 investigated the pathogenesis of stroke in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the combination of pre-existing vascular risk factors and immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases the risk of stroke. The study found that the immune response to the virus, along with vascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, can lead to an amplified inflammatory reaction, vessel thrombosis, and ultimately, stroke. Key findings from the study, which evaluated patient records with COVID-19 and stroke diagnoses within a three-month period, include: A low stroke rate (0.5%) among Mayo Clinic patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Over 80% of individuals had at least one traditional stroke risk factor. There was a high level of serum biomarkers for inflammation and coagulation. Only 7% of individuals with acute ischemic stroke received intravenous alteplase treatment. A 37% mortality rate was observed among the individuals studied. The low reperfusion therapy rate is attributed to patients' hesitancy to seek hospital care during the pandemic. Dr. Bart M. Demaerschalk, a study author, emphasizes the importance of early recognition and treatment, which includes managing COVID-19 infection and recanalizing occluded arteries. This study highlights the complex interplay between vascular risk factors and immune responses in COVID-19 patients, providing valuable insights for understanding and forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and stroke complications.

Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The Steering Committee of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets, and Administration (CIBA) has announced the relaxation of some COVID-19 preventive measures in Senate workplaces, while still maintaining many precautions. The most significant changes include allowing senators and staff to remove masks at their desks if two-meter physical distancing is possible and the reopening of the cafeteria with full capacity and warm food options. Shuttle services have also returned to full capacity, with mandatory mask-wearing. The vaccination requirement for staff and visitors remains in effect, and increased cleaning and contact tracing will continue. These decisions are made with the health and safety of senators and staff as the top priority, following guidance from public health authorities. This gradual easing of restrictions suggests that COVID-19 hospitalizations are expected to remain manageable, allowing for a cautious return to normalcy in Senate workplaces.

Title: Youth unemployment in Canada, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom in times of COVID-19
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some key facts and figures that could be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth unemployment in four countries: Canada, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It uses data from the COVID-19 Youth Economic Activity and Health Monitor project, as well as statistics from official sources in each country. During the initial phase of the pandemic (March 2020 to May 2020), youth unemployment rates increased in all four countries, with Canada experiencing the largest increase of 11.7 percentage points, followed by Ireland (8.2 pp), the UK (2.1 pp), and Germany (1.5 pp). There were differences in the speed and magnitude of increases in long-term unemployment among the unemployed youth in these countries. The UK had the highest proportion of long-term unemployment among youth during the initial shock, while Canada experienced a larger increase in the share of long-term unemployment during the third wave (Feb-May 2021). When comparing the unemployment rates before the pandemic (2019) and during its peak (June 2020), Canada had the largest increase of 16 pp, followed by Ireland (3.4 pp), the UK (2.4 pp), and Germany (1.6 pp). By summer 2021, youth unemployment rates had mostly recovered but remained higher than their 2019 levels. Canada's youth unemployment rate was 2.6 pp higher, Ireland's was 2.2 pp higher, while Germany and the UK had smaller differences of 1.2 and 1.5 pp, respectively. While the article focuses on youth unemployment, it does not provide specific facts or models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, understanding the economic impact of the pandemic, including unemployment trends, can be valuable contextual information when considering the overall societal effects of COVID-19.

Title: Trying to Solve a Covid Mystery: Africa’s Low Death Rates
Publisher: The New York Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
In Sierra Leone, a West African nation of eight million, COVID-19 does not seem to be a significant concern. The district's COVID response center has recorded only 11 cases with no deaths, and the regional hospital's COVID ward is shut with no patients. This trend is seen across much of sub-Saharan Africa, with low rates of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths that have puzzled scientists. The debate centers on whether cases and deaths are going uncounted or if there are other factors at play that have mitigated the impact of COVID-19 in these regions. Understanding the reasons behind the low numbers is important for global public health.

Title: Long-Haul COVID-19 in Children and Teens
Publisher: HealthyChildren.org
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article discusses the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on children and teens, referred to as "long-haul COVID" or "Post-Acute COVID-19." While most kids and teens experience mild or no symptoms during their acute infection, a significant number have reported lingering or recurring symptoms months after their initial recovery. The article highlights the case of Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl who experienced mild symptoms initially but then developed Post-Acute Covid-19, characterized by lethargy, headaches, extreme fatigue, and cognitive issues. The specific symptoms and duration of long-haul COVID vary, but common symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, cough, trouble breathing, joint or muscle pain, chest or stomach pain, mood changes, headache, fever, heart palpitations, loss of smell or taste, and lightheadedness when standing up. In some cases, these symptoms can be debilitating and significantly impact a child's quality of life. The cause of long-haul COVID is not yet fully understood, and there is no specific test for diagnosis. Treatment focuses on managing individual symptoms, and the condition can last for an extended period. MIS-C, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, is a rare but serious condition that has been associated with COVID-19. Vaccination is currently the best way to protect children and teens from COVID-19 and its potential long-term effects.

Title: COVID-19 croup during Omicron
Publisher: Boston Children's Discoveries
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
During the Omicron surge, there was an observed increase in croup cases among infants and young children, with Boston Children's reporting 75 cases. Croup is characterized by a distinctive "barking" cough and sometimes labored, high-pitched breathing. A review of the cases at Boston Children's found that 80% of the children with croup arrived during the Omicron surge, suggesting a link between the variant and the increase in croup cases. The cases were also more severe than usual, with a higher rate of hospitalization and more medication doses required. COVID-19 croup may be more severe than croup caused by other viruses, and further research is needed to determine the best treatment options. Parents are advised to seek medical attention if their child exhibits frequent noisy inhalations, clear struggles to breathe, increased fatigue, blue lips or fingertips, a high temperature for more than three days, or if mild croup symptoms last longer than seven days. While croup can be caused by various viruses, the possibility of COVID-19 should be considered, and testing is recommended.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic still hitting low income areas hardest, Ontario's science table says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Low-income areas in Ontario have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, experiencing higher death rates and a greater pandemic burden overall. The latest data from the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table shows that this trend has persisted through all five waves of the pandemic, including the most recent Omicron wave. The mortality rate in low-income neighborhoods was two to two-and-a-half times higher than in the highest-income areas. This disparity is due to various factors, including higher-risk employment in the services sector, lower vaccination rates, and higher population density in lower-income communities. Additionally, individuals in low-income areas often face barriers to accessing healthcare and have limited access to paid sick leave, making them more vulnerable to the virus. To reduce the impact of COVID-19 on these vulnerable communities, experts recommend maintaining workplace safety standards and improving ventilation in schools and workplaces. They also emphasize the importance of outreach initiatives to increase vaccination rates among marginalized and racialized groups. However, with mask mandates in Ontario set to lift, there are concerns that the disproportionate impact on low-income and racialized communities will worsen. Doctors highlight the need for investments in social safety nets and policies such as paid sick leave, improved housing, and better access to healthcare and vaccines to address these disparities. They argue that failing to take action will result in COVID-19 and long COVID concentrating in low-income areas, further exacerbating health inequalities. The social, health, and economic policies required to protect vulnerable communities from COVID-19 are similar to those needed to address broader health and social issues. By implementing these policies, Ontario can work towards reducing the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on marginalized communities and improving overall health outcomes.
