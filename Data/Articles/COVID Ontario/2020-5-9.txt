The stories also illustrate how CERB has enabled households to:
1. Cover essential expenses: Paying rent, keeping food on the table, and meeting utility bills are just a few examples of how CERB has helped individuals meet their basic needs.
2. Defer or reduce debt payments: Some respondents have been able to put off or lower payments on other financial obligations, providing temporary relief from financial pressure.
3. Plan for the future: CERB recipients like Brandi Wein are using the benefit as a safety net while they prepare for their businesses to reopen and recover.
The article serves as a reminder that many Canadians have been severely affected by the pandemic, and government support programs like CERB have helped mitigate some of the economic impact.

Title: Why some nursing homes won't let families install 'granny cams' to check on their loved ones
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the use of "granny cams" in long-term care homes, specifically focusing on audio recording capabilities and their legality. The story revolves around Pepin's concerns about her mother's mental health due to isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Pepin installed a granny cam with audio functionality in her mother's room at Extendicare long-term care home to ensure staff were following safety protocols and intervene if she saw anything that might put her mother at risk. However, there is some confusion regarding the legality of using audio recording on these cameras.
The Advocacy Centre for the Elderly recommends not having an audio function on granny cams due to potential privacy issues. Meanwhile, lawyer Daniel Nassrallah advises his clients to install cameras with audio functionality in their loved ones' rooms, citing that staff don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy when in residents' rooms.
Nassrallah points out a 2017 Quebec ruling and the Supreme Court's rejection of an appeal from the union representing long-term care workers in Quebec as evidence supporting his stance. The article concludes by mentioning Extendicare's response to the issue, stating that the Supreme Court's rejection should not be read as an endorsement.
Additionally, the Ontario Personal Support Workers' Association supports relatives installing cameras and suggests allowing two-way audio functionality during the pandemic, citing its potential benefits for residents' well-being.
