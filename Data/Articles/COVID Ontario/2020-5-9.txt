Title: Social media used to spread, create COVID-19 falsehoods
Publisher: Harvard Gazette
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
During a disease outbreak, the public often receives a flood of advice, remedies, and theories that can be misleading or false. The COVID-19 pandemic is facing a similar challenge, with social media playing a significant role in spreading misinformation and disinformation. The public is both consuming and disseminating inaccurate information, creating a challenging dynamic for public health communicators. While some misinformation may be unintentional, disinformation campaigns deliberately spread falsehoods for political gain. This has led to a "pandemic of misinformation," as stated by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. The article discusses the challenges faced by public health officials and the media in providing clear and accurate guidance to the public. It highlights the need for credible, transparent, and trustworthy communication from officials, which has been lacking according to Kasisomayajula Viswanath, a professor of health communication. The mainstream media's coverage has also contributed to the problem, with reporters and editors lacking medical or public health training reassigned to cover the pandemic, leading to a lack of critical and authoritative reporting on the science. Political bias, particularly from right-leaning media outlets, has also influenced the spread of misinformation. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican Party communications director, describes an "active disinformation campaign" by pro-Trump media, downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and deflecting responsibility from the president during his reelection campaign. Correcting misinformation is challenging, as people can become entrenched in their beliefs, influenced by media echo chambers. Christopher Robichaud, a senior lecturer in ethics and public policy, emphasizes the need for more than just introducing new evidence, but also addressing strategies used to diminish counter-evidence. Social media platforms have been criticized for not doing enough to curb the spread of misinformation, relying more on artificial intelligence than human moderators during the remote work period. Public health officials should focus on effective communication surveillance to understand the public's concerns, misconceptions, and circulating myths. While some misinformation may seem outlandish, Robichaud cautions against dismissing believers as uninterested in the truth. Instead, he suggests that intellectual humility is essential during a time of great uncertainty, acknowledging the limitations of our expertise. Viswanath also advises the public to be more skeptical and critical of the information they encounter, especially online.

Title: The emerging long-term complications of Covid-19, explained
Publisher: Vox.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the long-term effects of COVID-19, which are still not fully understood. An estimated 40-45% of people with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that resolve within two weeks. However, some patients, like Lauren Nichols, experience a wide range of symptoms that last for eight weeks or longer. Doctors are concerned about the potential for long-term damage, including lung scarring, heart damage, and neurological and mental health effects. Preliminary evidence and research on similar coronaviruses suggest that for some people, a full recovery could take years, and for others, there may never be a return to normal. One of the potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 is lung scarring, which can make normal activities challenging due to reduced lung capacity. Another concern is the high rate of blood clots in hospitalized patients, which can lead to lung blockages, strokes, heart attacks, and other serious complications. Blood clots can also cause renal failure and require ongoing dialysis. Heart damage is another possible consequence, as viral particles may inflame the heart muscle and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. COVID-19 also appears to affect the central nervous system, with potential long-lasting neurocognitive problems such as decreased attention, concentration, and memory. Delirium, a common occurrence in ICU patients, is associated with future long-term cognitive decline. Research on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suggests that one in five survivors experiences long-term cognitive impairment, even years after recovery. In addition to the physical impacts, COVID-19 can have significant mental health effects, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. The stigma associated with the disease can further isolate patients and impact their mental health. The article also mentions a small but growing number of children presenting with a severe immune response similar to Kawasaki disease, which can have serious myocardial and vascular complications in adulthood. Overall, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are still largely unknown, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential consequences of the disease.

Publisher: Toronto Star
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article offers a forecast of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States for the period of December 2022 to February 2023, based on data and models from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The forecast predicts a wave of infections due to the Omicron variant, which is expected to peak in late January 2023, with a peak of 1.4 million cases per day. This wave is predicted to cause a surge in hospitalizations, with an estimated 19,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations at the peak. The forecast also predicts that the majority of hospitalizations will occur in people aged 75 and older, with an estimated 9,600 hospitalizations at the peak for this age group. The forecast emphasizes the importance of vaccination and booster doses in reducing the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, especially for high-risk individuals. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and plan accordingly, it is important to consider the following key facts: Vaccination and booster status: The vaccination status of the population, including the uptake of booster doses, will significantly impact hospitalization rates. It is important to encourage individuals to stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations to reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Omicron variant: The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and expected to drive a significant wave of infections. However, early data suggests that it may cause less severe illness compared to previous variants, which could result in lower hospitalization rates. Healthcare system capacity: The capacity and resources of the healthcare system need to be taken into account when forecasting hospitalizations. A surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations could strain healthcare resources and impact the quality of care provided. Regional variations: COVID-19 hospitalizations can vary significantly across different regions due to factors such as population density, vaccination rates, and the presence of underlying health conditions. Forecasts should consider regional variations to allocate resources effectively. Public health measures: The implementation and adherence to public health measures, such as mask mandates, social distancing, and testing, can impact the spread of the virus and subsequently influence hospitalization rates. New variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can significantly impact hospitalization forecasts. It is important to monitor the spread of new variants and their potential impact on severity and transmissibility. Seasonal factors: COVID-19 hospitalizations may exhibit seasonal variations, with higher rates during the winter months when people tend to spend more time indoors and respiratory viruses circulate more easily. High-risk groups: It is important to specifically focus on high-risk groups, such as the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with underlying health conditions, as they are more likely to require hospitalization. Healthcare disparities: Consideration of healthcare disparities and equitable access to healthcare services is crucial in forecasting hospitalizations. Underserved communities may have higher hospitalization rates due to limited access to preventive measures and healthcare resources. Data accuracy: The accuracy and timeliness of data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and vaccinations are critical for reliable forecasting. Efforts should be made to improve data collection and reporting systems. By incorporating these facts and continuously monitoring the evolving situation, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and public health officials can better forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and allocate resources effectively to meet the needs of affected individuals and communities.

Title: Data gaps exist on COVID-19 cases in Indigenous communities, says research fellow
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) reported a total of 161 confirmed COVID-19 cases on First Nations reserves as of May 5, with cases in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec. However, there are concerns that the data being collected and reported may not be presenting a complete picture of the impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous communities. ISC's data includes two deaths and 17 hospitalizations, but this information was not initially made available online. The website also lacks information on recovered cases, affected communities, and First Nations members living off-reserve, including those in long-term care facilities. Courtney Skye, a research fellow, has been gathering data from various sources and found that community reports are outpacing the data reported by ISC. She highlights the case of an elder in a rehabilitation center in Montreal who passed away from COVID-19 but was not counted by ISC as they lived off-reserve. Skye emphasizes the need for better data to address the unique challenges and inequalities faced by First Nations communities in terms of healthcare access and transparency. In response, ISC stated that they monitor and track multiple sources of information while protecting patient privacy and that provinces and territories don't require individuals to self-identify when testing. They also mentioned efforts to make more data available online. Skye agrees that access to more information is crucial for decision-making, especially for individuals and families assessing their own risk and needs during the pandemic. The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) has established a national task force on COVID-19, co-chaired by Manitoba Regional Chief Kevin Hart, to help First Nations receive accurate information and recommendations. Hart emphasizes the importance of data collection and sharing for informed decision-making and advocacy for both on and off-reserve members. He highlights the large urban Indigenous population in Manitoba and the need to ensure proper resources for all.

Here is a summary of the article: Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) in Canada have developed an in-house COVID-19 test that can provide results within 24 hours and be completed in large volumes. The test has been licensed by the Ontario Ministry of Health and is more cost-effective than commercial platforms. The test detects the genetic information of the virus using nasal swab samples and a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the genetic sequence for detection. This has increased testing capacity in the Kingston region and reduced the time to inform patients of outcomes. The testing technique has been shared with other laboratories across Ontario through a provincial diagnostic network established by Ontario Health to coordinate COVID-19 testing. The network ensures labs can meet capacity and testing requirements and provides a platform for collaboration and problem-solving. The Queen's and KHSC team will continue to monitor the virus and adapt the test as needed. This initiative has helped to increase testing capacity and efficiency, providing faster results and enabling better management of the pandemic. The collaboration between different institutions and the establishment of a provincial network have been key to successfully addressing the challenges of COVID-19 testing.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadians' living situations and how different types of dwellings and housing tenure are associated with various challenges and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Key points include: Extended periods of staying at home due to COVID-19 restrictions have brought increased focus on people's living spaces, with 90% of respondents in a survey reporting that they were avoiding leaving their homes. In large urban centers, 40% of households reside in single-detached houses that are owned, while 26% live in rented apartments. Households in rented apartments are less likely to be satisfied with their living space, with 70% reporting satisfaction compared to 88% in owned single-detached houses. Renters are also more likely to face financial difficulties and have concerns about the affordability of their dwelling. Health vulnerabilities are higher among households in rented apartments, with one-fifth rating their general health as poor or fair. The article concludes that households in rented apartments may face increased challenges during the pandemic due to their living situations and socio-economic vulnerabilities. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors mentioned in the article could be important: Household density and living space: People living in crowded conditions or with limited living space may be at higher risk of infection and transmission within their households. Health vulnerabilities: Households with members who have underlying health conditions or poor general health may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, leading to hospitalizations. Financial difficulties: Financial stress may impact access to healthcare and the ability to self-isolate or practice preventive measures. Social isolation: Socially isolated individuals may have a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to a lack of social support. By considering these factors and analyzing data on household characteristics, health status, and socioeconomic factors, forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations can be informed and potentially improved.
