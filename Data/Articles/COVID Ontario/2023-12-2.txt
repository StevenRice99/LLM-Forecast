Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the values most important for forecasting: As of Nov. 25, the COVID-19 test positivity rate in Ontario was 20%, indicating a high level of circulating COVID-19 cases. Wastewater surveillance and hospitalizations also show climbing COVID-19 cases in Canada. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist, is concerned about the low uptake of the new COVID XBB-variant vaccine, which could lead to more hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 this year compared to last year. The article also mentions that the flu season has started in Canada, which could put additional pressure on hospitals and emergency departments, particularly in pediatrics. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may increase in the coming weeks and months, especially if vaccine uptake remains low.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Experts predict that COVID-19 will reach levels in December not yet seen this year, combining with surges of flu, RSV, and other pathogens to create a "syndemic" winter. COVID-19 wastewater levels are "high" and increasing, on track to surpass their 2023 peak. COVID-19 hospitalizations are up 10% week over week in the US. The variant "Pirola" (BA.2.86) and its descendants, such as JN.1, are spreading quickly and could heighten an anticipated winter surge. Experts expect COVID-19 to remain a major force impacting hospitalizations and death numbers, even if the respiratory season returns to a more standard pattern. The "immunity debt" theory suggests that infections from other pathogens may spike after pandemic precautions are abandoned, contributing to a potentially severe winter respiratory disease season. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 wastewater levels COVID-19 hospitalization rates Spread of variants such as Pirola (BA.2.86) and JN.1 Immunity debt theory and its potential impact on hospitalizations Note: While the article primarily focuses on the US, the expert opinions and trends mentioned can be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as the province may experience similar patterns and challenges.

Title: Most Ottawa COVID-19 signals are very high

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 numbers are mostly rising or stable, with very high individual trends. The city's wastewater data shows a rising average coronavirus level, which is considered very high. The average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 has risen to 79, including two patients in an ICU. The weekly average test positivity rate sits at about 20%, which is considered very high. There are 38 active COVID outbreaks, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals, with a very high number of new outbreaks. The health unit reported 292 more COVID cases in the last week and four more COVID deaths. Other regions in Eastern Ontario, such as the Kingston area and the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, are also reporting high-risk times for COVID transmission, with moderate to very high test positivity rates and hospitalizations. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may continue to rise, driven by increasing case numbers, high test positivity rates, and a growing number of outbreaks. The data from wastewater and hospitalizations suggests that the situation is worsening, and the region is entering a high-risk period for respiratory illnesses.

Title: Reduction in influenza, RSV during COVID-19 pandemic linked to less asthma, COPD events
Publisher: Healio
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, RSV, and rhino/enterovirus, and the resulting effects on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, COPD, and respiratory tract infections in Ontario, Canada. The study found that during the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of these viruses, leading to a decrease in hospitalizations and ED visits for related conditions. However, the study also notes that as public health measures were alleviated, there was a "rebound" in healthcare utilization due to asthma, COPD, and respiratory tract infections, particularly in October, which corresponds to the peak of rhino/enterovirus. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Reduction in incidence of influenza, RSV, and other respiratory viruses during the pandemic (>90%) Decrease in hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma, COPD, and respiratory tract infections during the pandemic (57-85%) "Rebound" in healthcare utilization due to asthma, COPD, and respiratory tract infections in October, corresponding to the peak of rhino/enterovirus Impact of public health measures on the incidence of respiratory viruses and related healthcare utilization These findings can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, by highlighting the potential impact of the pandemic on other respiratory viruses and related healthcare utilization, as well as the importance of considering public health measures in forecasting models.

Title: Ontario is reporting a surge in COVID-19. What does that mean for us?

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The COVID-19 wastewater signal in Ontario has doubled over the last month and is now at its highest point since mid-November 2022. The positivity rate for PCR tests in Ontario has nearly doubled to over 20% in the last week. COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada increased from 3,894 to 4,369 in the last seven days, with 248 of those admissions taking place in Ontario. Dr. Isaac Bogoch expects a peak in cases as we enter the winter months, but notes that most individuals are not experiencing severe symptoms or hospitalization due to vaccination or prior infection. Seniors (especially those over 80) are disproportionately affected and have low uptake of updated vaccinations (only 25% have received a booster). Experts urge residents to stay up to date on vaccinations, including COVID-19 and influenza, and to take measures such as masking and staying home when feeling unwell to prevent infections. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Wastewater signal: 1.9 ( highest point since mid-November 2022) Positivity rate: over 20% (nearly doubled in the last week) Hospitalizations: 248 admissions in Ontario in the last seven days Vaccination rates: low uptake of updated vaccinations among seniors (25%) Age groups: seniors (especially those over 80) are disproportionately affected.
