This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Canadians, particularly in Toronto, where they make up 9% of the population but account for 25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The article also notes that Black people are more likely to be essential workers living in precarious conditions, making social distancing more difficult. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Toronto are Black, despite making up only 9% of the population. 8 out of the top 10 COVID-19 hotspots in Toronto are in the city's north-west end, where many Black and racialized communities reside. Limited race-based medical research data is available in Canada, but a 2015 McGill study found that Black women have significantly higher preterm births than white women. Historical examples of systemic racism in healthcare, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, contribute to mistrust of the healthcare system among Black Canadians. Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and build trust with Black communities are underway, including the allocation of $12.5 million in funding towards community health agencies in 15 high-risk communities. These values highlight the need to consider the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Canadians and the importance of addressing systemic racism in healthcare to build trust and increase vaccine uptake in these communities.

Title: Important thing to know about the novel coronavirus: It's a shapeshifter

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the values most important for forecasting: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving to evade immune responses by changing the shape of its spike protein, which could lead to increased infectiousness and potentially reduced effectiveness of current vaccines. Research has identified a pattern of genetic modifications in the virus that are occurring in the same spots, suggesting an evolutionary process is underway. These modifications involve genetic code disappearing, allowing the virus to change the shape of its spike protein and potentially resist neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests that the virus is not becoming unstoppable, but rather, it is evolving to require new formulas to take out new variants. The researchers emphasize the importance of having multiple approaches to combat the virus, including combinations of different antibodies, nanobodies, and vaccines. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Increased infectiousness of new variants (e.g., B.1.1.7) Potential reduced effectiveness of current vaccines against new variants Need for new formulas to take out new variants Importance of having multiple approaches to combat the virus These values can inform forecasting models by considering the potential impact of evolving variants on hospitalization rates and the need for updated vaccines and treatments.
