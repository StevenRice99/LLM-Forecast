Title: New COVID-19 outbreak declared at Cargill meat plant in Alberta — site of Canada's largest outbreak
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
There is a new outbreak of COVID-19 cases at the Cargill meat-processing plant in High River, Alberta, with 11 cases linked to the facility as of Saturday. This is concerning as an outbreak at the same plant in 2020 infected nearly half of its workforce, with around 950 staff testing positive. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 401 president, Thomas Hesse, emphasized the rapid spread of the virus during the previous outbreak, highlighting the importance of early intervention. Cargill, the town of High River, and Alberta Health Services are all working to implement safety measures and offer testing to employees. The union is investigating the extent of the outbreak and evaluating the effectiveness of health and safety measures in place. This outbreak is particularly concerning given the serious consequences of the previous outbreak at the Cargill plant, which resulted in two worker deaths and one worker's father's death. The company is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging inadequate safeguards. Alberta New Democratic Party Leader Rachel Notley has also expressed deep concern, stating that a repeat of the 2020 outbreak cannot be allowed to happen and that the plant must be shut down if new safety measures prove ineffective. With the High River plant processing around one-third of Canada's processed beef supply, an outbreak could have significant implications for the country's beef supply chain. There are currently outbreaks at seven meat-processing facilities in the province, including the Olymel pork plant in Red Deer, with 168 cases and one death. The situation at the Cargill plant and the overall increase in cases in meat-processing facilities in Alberta may contribute to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in the region.

Title: Your COVID-19 Vaccine Questions Answered
Publisher: Metis Nation of Ontario
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article is a transcript of a town hall meeting held by the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) on January 21, 2021, to address their plans for rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination. Here are the key points and answers to the questions raised during the town hall: Identification required for vaccination: MNO citizens need to provide government-issued identification (e.g., health card, driver's license) and their Métis Nation of Ontario Citizenship card to be eligible for the first round of vaccinations. Advanced registration for immunocompromised individuals: The MNO has determined that citizens aged 65 and above, as well as immunocompromised or high-risk individuals, will be eligible for advanced registration. This includes those with congenital conditions, illnesses like HIV/AIDS or cancer, or those on immunosuppressant medications. Diabetics, who are considered high-risk, are also eligible for advanced registration. Vaccination for non-MNO family members: Discussions are ongoing regarding the timing and process of vaccine rollout for non-MNO citizens residing in the same household. Antibody testing: Antibody tests are available in Ontario for a fee from three laboratories (Dynacare, Med-Health, and LifeLabs). A requisition form signed by a healthcare provider is required. Antibody testing is different from the COVID-19 PCR test available to all Métis in Ontario. Second vaccine dose: The recommended interval between doses is 21-27 days, but supply challenges may result in longer wait times. There is currently no data on the maximum interval between doses, and a longer interval does not require restarting the series. The government of Ontario is prioritizing second doses for long-term care and elder care home residents. Vaccine eligibility by age: The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for those aged 16 and above, while the Moderna vaccine is approved for those aged 18 and above. Vaccine availability for MNO adults: The MNO estimates that vaccines will likely be available to adults in March 2021, but this may change depending on vaccine supply. Registration process: Details on the vaccine rollout are still in development. Information on registration will be communicated through the MNO website. Vaccine for pregnant and breastfeeding women: Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals can access COVID-19 vaccines after informed counseling and consent, which includes a review of risks and benefits. Voluntary vaccination: The MNO, along with federal and provincial governments, has stated that the COVID-19 vaccine will be voluntary. Vaccine for immunocompromised individuals with allergies: It is recommended to consult an allergist-immunologist. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may be contraindicated for those with severe allergic reactions to a previous dose or vaccine components. Informed counseling and consent are required for individuals with autoimmune conditions or immunocompromised due to disease or treatment. Vaccine effectiveness: According to research, the vaccine efficacy for the two approved mRNA vaccines was consistent across various subgroups, with an overall efficacy of 94-95%. The vaccine efficacy was consistent regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, obesity, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Notification of vaccination: MNO citizens who have already received the vaccine (e.g., caregivers to parents in long-term care homes) do not need to notify the MNO. Registration for vaccine clinics will be organized separately. New MNO citizens: Those who have received their acceptance letter can use it along with government-issued photo ID to get the vaccine. Phase One vaccination: The first phase of vaccine rollout in Ontario includes all adult Métis, Inuit, and First Nations populations. Local health unit awareness: Information regarding the timing and process of vaccine rollout is still in development. The MNO will communicate updates through its website. Contacting seniors: The MNO is co-developing a process to proactively reach out to seniors aged 65 and above, including those who may not use email or a computer. Moderna vaccine availability: Details on the timing and availability of the Moderna vaccine are still in development due to delays in vaccine shipments to Canada. Vaccination locations: MNO offices are not currently equipped to administer vaccines and are not a choice for the vaccine rollout at this time. The MNO is working with the Ministry and partners to find the best options. Some important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include: The priority given to specific vulnerable groups, such as citizens aged 65 and above, immunocompromised individuals, and those with high-risk medical conditions (including diabetes). The potential delay between the first and second doses of the vaccine due to supply challenges, which could impact the effectiveness of the vaccination program. The voluntary nature of the vaccination program, which may affect uptake and the overall success of the program in reducing hospitalizations. The availability of antibody testing to identify individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19, which could provide additional data for forecasting hospitalizations. These factors, along with the vaccine efficacy rates and the timing of vaccine availability, will play a crucial role in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in the coming months.

Title: Impact of COVID-19 on merchandise imports: evidence based on end-use goods
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
This article examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on international merchandise imports, specifically in Canada for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The analysis is conducted using monthly Broad Economic Categories, Rev. 5 (BEC5) data, which provides insights into imports and exports as inputs into production, capital sources, and sources of goods for final consumption. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted imports of intermediate goods, capital goods, and consumption goods differently. In absolute terms, intermediate goods were the most affected, with a decline of $21.6 billion, followed by capital goods ($18.5 billion) and consumption goods ($10.4 billion). However, in relative terms, capital goods were the most adversely affected, with a decline of 24.4%. The top BEC categories in terms of value in the first half of 2020 were construction, housing, appliances, and furniture; transport equipment and travel services; and energy, mining, basic metals, and chemicals. Further analysis reveals that intermediate goods, capital goods, and consumption goods in the transport equipment and travel services category were the most negatively impacted by the pandemic, with declines of 28.8%, 38.5%, and 36.7%, respectively. The disruption in this category was influenced by major auto sector companies temporarily halting production for worker safety and weaker global demand. End-use categories in the energy, mining, basic metals, and chemicals category were the second most affected, with declines in intermediate goods, capital goods, and consumption goods. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of supply chain diversification outside of China, particularly for personal protective equipment. The data suggests that Canada heavily relies on the U.S. as a supplier of end-use products, with this dependence increasing for certain products between the first halves of 2019 and 2020. China is expected to remain a significant supplier of intermediate goods, especially in the textile, apparel, footwear, and jewelry category. Canadian companies considering supply chain diversification often opt for U.S. suppliers but also look to other countries as a backup. While not directly providing forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article's analysis of the pandemic's impact on international merchandise imports offers insights into the disruption of supply chains and changes in trade patterns. The information can help businesses and policymakers make informed decisions about supply chain resilience and economic recovery.

Title: Financial strain top source of worry in COVID-19 mental health crisis: public health researcher
Publisher: University of Alberta
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of financial strain on Canadians' mental and physical health, highlighting that addressing this issue will be crucial for the country's post-COVID social and economic recovery. The University of Alberta's Centre for Healthy Communities, led by public health professor Candace Nykiforuk, has received funding to study and address the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic related to financial strain. Financial strain is defined as the stress and uncertainty individuals feel about meeting their financial commitments, regardless of their income level. Nearly 30% of Canadians struggled with bill payments even before the pandemic, and financial worry has been the top pandemic-related anxiety for many. Financial strain has been linked to various mental and physical health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and chronic conditions. It disproportionately affects specific demographics, including single parents, women, people of color, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and seniors. The project aims to develop a range of actions and interventions for local, provincial, and federal governments to tackle financial strain related to COVID-19. The team will review evidence, consult experts, and engage with front-line workers to create a menu of effective actions, along with metrics to evaluate their impact. Addressing financial strain is crucial not only for individual health but also for societal well-being and economic prosperity, especially in preparing for future crises.

Title: Why Canada doesn’t know how many COVID-19 cases are linked to travel
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the arguments against implementing stricter travel restrictions in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing data that suggests a low percentage of cases are linked to travelers. However, it argues that the data may not accurately represent the true number of travel-related COVID-19 cases and that the system needs to be more robust, timely, and accurate. The article explains that the current estimates of travel-related cases are based on reports of potential exposures on international and domestic flights, with passengers in nearby rows deemed at higher risk. However, only direct cases involving air passengers who exhibit symptoms and test positive are counted. There is no routine testing or contact tracing of travelers entering Canada, and infections that occur during travel to and from airports or on connecting domestic flights are not counted. The methods for measuring travel-related infections also make questionable assumptions about the reliability of testing, contact tracing, and quarantine compliance. The article calls for improved testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures, as well as random sampling to estimate infections at different points of entry and during travel. Genomic sequencing of positive results is also highlighted as important for quickly identifying imported cases of new COVID-19 variants. To facilitate effective policy decisions and manage the risks associated with travel and COVID-19, the article concludes that more comprehensive and accurate data is needed. Reducing non-essential travel and focusing resources on testing, contact tracing, and quarantine can help improve the accuracy of the data and manage the risks more effectively. As for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models. However, the article's call for improved data collection and testing could help provide more accurate forecasts by capturing a more representative sample of travel-related COVID-19 cases, including those that may be asymptomatic or undetected under the current system.

Title: Interim guidance on the use of Abbott Panbio COVID-19 antigen rapid test, CCDR 47(1)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 7 days ago
This document provides interim guidance on using the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test in Canada as of December 12, 2020. The test is designed for qualitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen in human nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals suspected of having COVID-19. Health Canada approved the test for use in October 2020, and it is intended for professional use as an aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test provides preliminary results, and negative results do not rule out infection. The clinical performance of the Panbio test must be closely monitored due to its anticipated low sensitivity. The Panbio test is less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification tests, including the Abbott ID NOW, and its performance characteristics must be considered when interpreting results. The test is suitable for point-of-care applications due to its rapid nature and ease of use. However, the incidence of infection within the tested population and indications for testing, such as symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals, must also be considered. The document outlines scenarios where the Panbio test may be useful, including symptomatic testing in congregated settings, symptomatic testing in Northern, remote, and isolated communities, and asymptomatic community-based surveillance. In high-prevalence settings with limited access to RT-PCR testing, the Panbio test could be used, with positive results triggering immediate public health actions while confirmatory PCR tests are conducted. The test's utility depends on factors beyond its intrinsic performance characteristics, including infection prevalence, predictive values, and intended use. In critical decision-making scenarios, the most accurate test, currently RT-PCR, is recommended. However, the Panbio test could enhance testing capacity, particularly when demand exceeds laboratory capacity or in situations where symptomatic individuals may be lost to follow-up. Overall, this document provides guidance on using the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test in Canada, highlighting the need for careful consideration of its performance characteristics and appropriate use in different settings.
