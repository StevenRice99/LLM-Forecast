Title: North American trade in the time of COVID-19
Publisher: Dentons
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted international trade and supply chains, including in North America. The USMCA agreement, replacing NAFTA, will come into force on July 1, 2020, despite COVID-19 delays. COVID-19 has disrupted supply chains due to labor shortages and business closures. Several countries and organizations have emphasized the importance of cross-border supply chains during this time. Canada and the US temporarily closed land border crossings to non-essential travel, with the closure recently extended until June 21, 2020. Several Canadian provinces have also ordered the closure of non-essential businesses. The US has restricted travel across its borders with Mexico and Canada to essential travel only. President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, and individual states have implemented shutdown procedures. Mexico declared a sanitary emergency on March 30, 2020, and extended it until June 15, 2020, for non-essential activities. Only essential sectors such as health, food, transportation, and telecommunications were allowed to continue operating. Canada has committed to keeping its trade and supply chains open during the pandemic and has implemented measures to facilitate the import and export of essential goods. The US has implemented controls over the supply chain of PPE, requiring explicit approval from FEMA for exports until August 10, 2020. The US has also taken steps to advance its trade policy objectives despite the pandemic. Mexico has issued orders to facilitate the supply of essential goods, including medical equipment and hygienic products, and has waived certain requirements for importing these goods. This article focuses on trade-related impacts and does not provide specific data or forecasts related to COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the information on supply chain disruptions and border closures may be relevant when considering the availability of medical resources and the potential impact on hospitalization capacity.

Title: Modelling scenarios of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Canada, CCDR 46(6)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the use of predictive modeling to forecast the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the transmission of COVID-19 in Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) developed two complementary modeling approaches: an agent-based model and a deterministic compartment model. The models were calibrated using the latest literature and surveillance data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection dynamics. The key outputs of the models were the effective reproduction number (R e ), the final attack rate, and the duration of the epidemic under different NPI scenarios. Without any NPIs, the models predicted that over 70% of the Canadian population would be infected, and the epidemic would last about a year. When NPIs were partially effective, the epidemic was prolonged, the peak was reduced, and the attack rate was lowered to 50% or less. If NPIs were lifted early, the epidemic could rebound and result in a higher attack rate. However, if NPIs were applied with sufficient intensity to reduce R e below one, the attack rate could be reduced to between 1% and 25%. The PHAC modeling efforts informed public health decisions and highlighted the importance of maintaining effective NPIs to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada.

Publisher: Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the infodemic of COVID-19 information and how it can be overwhelming and misleading for people. Dr. Jeanna Parsons Leigh, a medical sociologist at Dalhousie University, is leading a research project to understand how Canadians receive, interpret, and act on COVID-19 information. The project includes a national survey, follow-up surveys, and focus groups to track public perceptions over time. The goal is to develop a "knowledge translation" campaign that provides evidence-based strategies to address knowledge gaps and misinformation. The campaign will include videos, resources, and customizable components to meet local needs and will be translated into multiple languages. The research aims to educate, engage, and empower Canadians to make informed health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure that public health responses resonate with and are meaningful to people's lives.

Title: Now is the time for a 'great reset'
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant social and economic disruption, and there are concerns about a potential global depression. To mitigate these impacts, a "Great Reset" of capitalism is proposed, involving joint and swift action from all countries and industries. The pandemic has shown that rapid and radical changes are possible, and there is a willingness to make sacrifices and move towards stakeholder capitalism. The Great Reset agenda has three main components: steering the market towards fairer outcomes, ensuring investments advance shared goals such as equality and sustainability, and harnessing innovations to support the public good. Governments should improve coordination, implement reforms for more equitable outcomes, and create conditions for a stakeholder economy. Large-scale spending programs provide an opportunity to create a new system that is more resilient and sustainable. The third priority is to leverage Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations to address health and social challenges. The COVID-19 crisis has affected people worldwide, but it also presents an opportunity to reset and create a healthier and more equitable future.

Title: Black neighbourhoods in Toronto are hit hardest by COVID-19 — and it’s ‘anchored in racism’: experts
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black communities in Toronto and the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to health inequities. Higher Coronavirus Rates in Black Neighborhoods: Global News' analysis revealed a strong association between high coronavirus infection rates and Toronto neighborhoods with a significant Black population. Income Inequality and Health: Lower-income neighborhoods in Toronto showed a stronger positive association with coronavirus rates. As incomes increased, the relationship weakened, suggesting that poverty plays a significant role in infection rates. Living Conditions and Racialization of Poverty: Denser, lower-income neighborhoods, often populated by racialized communities, face challenges with social distancing and quarantining. Dr. Nnorom attributed this to systemic racism, where people from these communities may take on precarious work due to discrimination, leading to overcrowded living conditions. Education and Employment: Neighborhoods with higher coronavirus rates had a higher number of adults without a degree, diploma, or trade qualification. Black people also face higher unemployment and underemployment rates, contributing to poverty and food insecurity, which further impact physical health. Work Circumstances: The analysis found links between coronavirus rates and work circumstances. Neighborhoods with many individuals having no fixed workplace and early morning commuters had higher infection rates, often due to front-line jobs with inadequate access to personal protective equipment. Underlying Health Conditions: Black communities may have underlying health conditions that predispose them to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Dr. Nnorom attributed this to the stress of everyday racism, leading to chronic health conditions. Anti-Black Racism in Healthcare: Anti-Black attitudes in Canadian healthcare contribute to inequities, with a report highlighting an incident of a young Black male patient facing disbelief in the emergency room. Similar Patterns in Other Cities: Similar findings were observed in Montreal, New York City, and Minnesota, where Black and minority communities experienced higher COVID-19 death rates and infection rates, respectively. Call for Race-Based Data Collection: Advocates emphasize the need for race-based data collection to understand the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities fully. This data is crucial for developing strategies to address disparities and create targeted interventions to support at-risk neighborhoods. Social Determinants of Health: The article concludes by highlighting the social determinants of health, including income, access to education, and food security, which contribute to health inequities exacerbated by the pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is essential to consider these social and economic factors affecting Black communities. Addressing these disparities through targeted interventions, improved data collection, and strategies to reduce overcrowding and provide adequate protective equipment can help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on these vulnerable communities.

Title: SFU, Providence Health Care develop AI tool for quicker COVID-19 diagnosis
Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Simon Fraser University (SFU) researchers and Providence Health Care (PHC) are working together to create an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to speed up COVID-19 diagnosis. The tool is currently being validated at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada, and uses chest x-ray images and bio-image detection analysis to distinguish between COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 cases. This will help healthcare professionals make quicker decisions and confirm their suspicions, especially for less experienced doctors. The AI system has been trained using X-ray images to identify unique characteristics of COVID-19 and can also be used for other types of chest x-ray pneumonia detection. The tool is not meant to replace standalone clinical diagnosis but to assist healthcare workers in rapid confirmation. Once approved, the tool will be made available for free globally, with the support of the United Nations. This collaboration between SFU and PHC showcases how universities and healthcare organizations can work together to address urgent issues like the COVID-19 crisis and make a positive impact on communities.

Title: Ventilators and COVID-19: What You Need to Know
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the role of ventilators in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ventilators are machines that pump air, often with extra oxygen, into patients' airways when they are unable to breathe effectively on their own. They are crucial for patients with severely impaired lung function, such as those with COVID-19, to support breathing. While ventilators do not cure illnesses, they can help keep patients alive while they fight infections or recover from injuries. The article features insights from Dr. Lauren Ferrante, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Yale Medicine, who explains how ventilators work and why they are essential in treating COVID-19 infections.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 'unprecedented levels of homelessness,' foundation warns
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the issue of homelessness and affordable housing in Toronto, with the potential for a significant increase in homelessness as a result of the economic downturn. The Toronto Foundation, a charitable organization, has released a brief highlighting the precariousness of the housing situation and calling for innovative solutions from all levels of government, individuals, and businesses. The brief estimates that thousands of renters have been struggling to make payments since April due to job losses and reduced work hours, and if even a small fraction of these renters are evicted, it could lead to a sharp rise in homelessness. The current capacity of the city's shelter system is already strained, operating at 98 to 99 percent capacity, and a potential influx of newly homeless individuals would further stretch resources. The brief also notes that the scale of the issue is unprecedented, with the potential for a much higher number of eviction cases compared to pre-pandemic levels. It is estimated that 10% of renters in Ontario missed their monthly rent payment in April, which equates to about 53,000 households or 130,000 people in Toronto alone. Furthermore, a less optimistic forecast could double that number to 260,000 people at risk of eviction and homelessness. While some renters are deferring payments with plans to repay in full later, the brief highlights the uncertainty surrounding those who may not be able to fulfill those agreements. To address the impending crisis, the brief calls for immediate action and suggests several measures, including longer-term income support programs, improvements to Employment Insurance, and opportunities for non-profit organizations to acquire properties for affordable housing. Additionally, advocacy groups like Maytree and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives recommend targeted rent relief funding, a gradual lifting of the eviction ban, and the reintroduction of provincial rent controls. The scale of the challenge is vast, but there is also a potential for lasting positive change in addressing the housing crisis through innovative solutions and collaboration.
