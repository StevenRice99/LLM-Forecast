This article is partially relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Although the article focuses on the situation in Quebec, it provides some valuable information that could be applied to Ontario: 1. The article mentions the spread of new variants (BA. 2.12.1, BA. 4, and BA. 5) that are more easily transmissible, which could potentially affect Ontario as well. 2. The article notes an increase in cases and hospitalizations in Quebec, which could be a warning sign for Ontario. 3. The article highlights the importance of public health guidelines, such as distancing, washing hands, and mask-wearing, which are also relevant for Ontario. However, the article does not provide specific data or information about the situation in Ontario, which would be more directly relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in the province. Therefore, while the article provides some useful context and insights, it is not directly applicable to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
