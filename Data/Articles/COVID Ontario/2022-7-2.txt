Title: Interim Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines in Children Aged 6 Months–5 Years — United States, June 2022
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The text appears to be an excerpt from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document, specifically addressing the recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Here are the key points:
Vaccine Safety 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare adverse events reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
Monitoring by CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink has not detected an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in children aged 5-11 years.
Recommendations 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months to 5 years as a 2-dose primary series.
ACIP also recommends vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years as a 3-dose primary series.
Risk-Benefit Analysis 
Despite high seroprevalence among young children (71% had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by April 2022), vaccination is still recommended due to the potential benefits of enhanced protection against reinfection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization.
No concerns have been identified in postauthorization safety surveillance associated with vaccination of seropositive persons aged 5 years.
Clinical Considerations 
Children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may require additional considerations, which can be found at the CDC website.
Future Updates 
ACIP will continue to review additional data as they become available and update recommendations or clinical considerations on their website.

Title: Severe Acute Hepatitis in Children of Unknown Etiology
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
This text appears to be a "Science Brief" from the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) on Acute Hepatitis in Children, likely related to the 2022 outbreak of severe acute hepatitis cases among children.
The main points are:
Key Takeaways 
Consult with a pediatric gastroenterologist for a child with AST  500 IU/L or INR  1.5.
Perform a complete infectious workup (respiratory virus testing, stool testing, serology, blood PCR) to investigate suspected etiologies (including SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus infection).
Consider additional investigations:
+ Autoimmune hepatitis evaluation (quantitative immunoglobulins, antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody)
+ Toxicology Testing
+ Other tests (ferritin, creatine kinase, ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha-1-antitrypsin)
When to Refer 
Consult a pediatric gastroenterologist for a child with:
+ ALT  500 IU/L or INR  1.5
+ Clinical concerns for hepatic encephalopathy (sleepiness, fatigue, altered mental status, movement abnormalities), GI bleeding, decreased urine output.
Consider prompt transfer to a Children's Hospital with a liver transplant program if the child has:
+ Persistent or continued elevation of serial INR values and bilirubin levels after one IV vitamin K dosage
+ Clinical concerns for hepatic encephalopathy (sleepiness, fatigue, altered mental status, movement abnormalities), GI bleeding, decreased urine output.
Interpretation 
Acute hepatitis often resolves with supportive care.
Consult a pediatric gastroenterologist to prioritize investigations, discuss management, review anticipatory guidance, and indications for admission.

Here is a brief summary of the article with values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Summary: This study from Public Health Ontario, the University of Toronto, and ICES analyzed data on 19.7 million mRNA COVID vaccine doses administered in Ontario between Dec 2020 and Sep 2021.
Relevant Values: 
Incidence rates per million doses: 15 cases per million vaccine doses for myocarditis or pericarditis overall.
Age-specific incidence: Highest rate among men 18-24 years old, with 299.5 cases per million doses after the second Moderna dose.
Dosing interval impact: Incidence dropped by one-fifth for both vaccines when spacing between doses was longer (56 days or more).
Specific rates: 16.2 myocarditis or pericarditis cases per million Moderna doses with a 56-day or longer interval, and 9.6 cases per million with a Pfizer dose followed by Moderna.
