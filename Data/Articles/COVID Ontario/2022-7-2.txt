Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses a study published in the journal Nature that developed a tool to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. The tool was designed to help hospitals and public health officials anticipate and plan for surges in hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The study used data from over 3 million patients in the United States who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2022. The researchers analyzed the data to identify patterns and create a predictive model for future hospitalizations. They found that certain factors, such as a person's age, gender, and underlying medical conditions, as well as regional factors like vaccination rates and the prevalence of new virus variants, influenced the risk of hospitalization. The forecasting tool combines data on these risk factors with local data on virus transmission rates and hospital capacity. It can predict the likelihood of hospitalization up to four weeks in advance and can be tailored to specific regions or demographic groups. According to the article, the ability to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations can help hospitals and health systems in several ways. It can allow them to ensure they have enough staff, beds, and resources available to care for patients. It can also help inform public health messaging and policies, such as encouraging mask-wearing or social distancing in areas where hospitalizations are expected to rise. The authors of the study emphasize that the tool is intended to complement, not replace, public health expertise and clinical judgment. They also note that the tool's accuracy may vary depending on the availability and quality of data and the presence of unforeseen factors, such as new virus variants. Overall, the development of a tool to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations can be a valuable resource for public health officials and healthcare systems in their efforts to manage and respond to the pandemic.

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article presents a methodology for estimating daily carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the global, national, and sectoral levels, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions. The authors use activity data such as energy consumption and emissions factors to estimate CO2 emissions, and they disaggregate annual emissions data into daily estimates. They also calculate daily emissions reductions due to workplace closures and simulate daily emissions baselines for 2020. The article includes a detailed explanation of the data sources and methods used for each sector, such as power generation, industry, ground transportation, aviation, and residential consumption. The authors also provide uncertainty estimates for their emissions estimates. Overall, they find that CO2 emissions in 2020 decreased by 6.3% compared to 2019, with a range of 5.5% to 7.2%. The article includes a correlation analysis between COVID-19 deaths, government response measures, and emissions reductions, but it does not directly discuss the forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause arrhythmias?
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe and effective, but like any medication, there is a small risk of side effects, which can include tiredness, headaches, muscle pain, and, in rare cases, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). While the COVID-19 vaccine may rarely affect the heart, the actual COVID-19 infection is much more likely to cause heart complications. A small percentage of people may experience myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination, which are inflammations of the heart muscle and its outer lining, respectively. Symptoms of these conditions include arrhythmia, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Myocarditis has been reported more often in young males and after the second vaccine dose, but most cases resolve quickly and are mild. The overall risk of heart inflammation from the COVID-19 vaccine is low, similar to that of other vaccines. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection has been linked to arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart attacks, and excessive inflammation in the heart muscle, which can disrupt electrical signals and lead to blood clots. Traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been found in the heart tissue of deceased patients, and the prevalence of myocarditis in competitive athletes post-infection is significantly higher than the risk associated with the vaccine. While vaccine-related side effects are typically minor and short-lived, individuals experiencing abnormal heartbeats after vaccination or infection should consult a doctor, as it could indicate a more serious cardiac issue.

Title: Long COVID symptoms linked to inflammation
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: An NIH-supported research team led by Drs. Benjamin tenOever and Venetia Zachariou investigated the underlying biology of Long COVID and its effects. They exposed golden hamsters to SARS-CoV-2 and compared the results to a group exposed to influenza A. Results showed that while both viruses were generally cleared within two weeks, hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited more extensive and slower recovery from lung damage and additional kidney damage. Analysis of hamster brains revealed that SARS-CoV-2 had unique effects on the olfactory system, causing extensive and long-lasting inflammation in the lining inside the nose and the olfactory bulb, a brain region associated with smell, emotion, and learning. This inflammation was linked to behavioral changes in the hamsters, possibly indicating mood disorders. Similar inflammation patterns were observed in a small sample of human olfactory bulb tissue from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 but died of other causes. The study suggests that persistent inflammation may be the mechanism behind many Long COVID symptoms, and the hamster model can be useful for developing future treatments. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider that Long COVID, affecting around 2.5% of COVID patients, can occur even in those with mild cases. The potential for long-term symptoms and organ damage underlines the seriousness of the disease and the need for effective treatments. The study's insights into the mechanism of Long COVID may help in developing strategies to prevent and manage these persistent symptoms.

Title: Severe Acute Hepatitis in Children of Unknown Etiology
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the rise in cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children, with initial reports from Scotland and Alabama leading to surveillance efforts worldwide. As of May 27, 2022, the World Health Organization reported 650 cases from 33 countries. The challenge lies in determining if the increase is real or due to heightened awareness. The article emphasizes the need for clinicians to report cases to investigate possible causes and monitor trends. The definition of severe acute hepatitis in children involves clinical, biochemical, and histopathological data, with a spectrum of severity from asymptomatic enzyme elevation to pediatric acute liver failure (PALF). The incidence of PALF remains uncertain, with some cases requiring transplantation and resulting in deaths. The article highlights the difficulty in determining the true incidence of acute hepatitis in children due to varied diagnostic practices. Potential causes of severe acute hepatitis in children include infectious and non-infectious conditions, with adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections being hypothesized culprits. Adenovirus has been detected in some cases, but its role as a direct cause remains unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been infrequently isolated in cases of hepatitis, but there is pathophysiologic evidence supporting its potential role in liver damage. Surveillance case definitions have been developed to detect potential signals of increased incidence, but variations in definitions across jurisdictions make direct comparisons challenging. The article stresses the importance of robust data collection and methodology to interpret reported numbers accurately and determine if there is a genuine cause for concern.

Title: Canada outperformed most G10 countries during first two years of pandemic response: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
A new study reveals that Canada's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in its first two years was more effective than most G10 countries. The study compared infection and death rates, excess mortality, vaccination rates, restrictions, and economic performance. Canada had the second-lowest per-capita COVID-19 cases and death rates among the countries studied. Its excess mortality rate, which accounts for deaths during the pandemic compared to expected deaths, was also second lowest. Canada also had the highest fully vaccinated population despite being slow to introduce vaccines. The study highlights the impact of public health measures and vaccinations in lowering Canada's infection and death rates. However, Canada's GDP growth was weaker compared to other countries, although it's challenging to attribute this solely to public health restrictions. The decisions and actions made during the pandemic have real costs and restrictions on individual freedom and society. As COVID-19 restrictions ease and vaccination rates slow, policymakers need to re-engage the public and emphasize the importance of their actions in controlling the pandemic and preparing for future challenges.

Title: Canada's COVID-19 response better than many comparable countries, study finds
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A recent study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that Canada managed the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic better than several other comparable countries. The study compares data from 11 countries, referred to as the G10, including Canada, the US, and several European nations. The research credits Canada's success to stringent and persistent public health measures and a high vaccination rate. Canada had the highest vaccination rate among the G10, with over 80% of eligible Canadians fully vaccinated with two doses as of June, compared to 64-77% in other G10 countries. Canada also had the lowest per-capita rate of COVID-19 cases (82,700 per million) and the second-lowest death rate (919 per million), only surpassed by Japan. The study's authors and other experts attribute Canada's positive outcomes to the country's strict public health measures and successful immunization drive. However, they also acknowledge the economic burden of the pandemic response, with Canada experiencing one of the highest relative increases in government debt. Looking ahead, there are concerns about a potential strain on the healthcare system in the fall when COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses are expected to coincide. Overall, the article highlights Canada's relatively successful handling of the pandemic compared to similar countries and underscores the importance of public health measures and vaccination campaigns in mitigating the impact of COVID-19.

Title: Infected with COVID-19? Cuddling your pet cat or dog can make them sick, says study - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses a Canadian study that suggests COVID-19 can be transmitted from infected humans to their pets, particularly cats and dogs. The study found that close contact with pets, such as kissing and sleeping in the same bed, increases the risk of transmission. While dogs are also susceptible, cats may have a higher rate of infection due to the way the virus latches onto receptors in their respiratory system. Over half of the cats studied that lived with a COVID-19-positive human had antibodies for the virus. Infected animals may show similar symptoms to humans, such as loss of appetite, lethargy, and sneezing. There is also evidence that infected animals can transmit the virus back to humans, as in the case of a veterinarian who likely caught COVID-19 from an infected cat. To minimize transmission, pet owners who are infected with COVID-19 should keep their distance from their pets, wear masks, and take other precautionary measures, similar to those recommended for human-to-human transmission. This information is important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it highlights the potential for human-to-animal transmission and the risk of subsequent animal-to-human transmission, which could contribute to the spread of the virus and impact hospitalization rates.
