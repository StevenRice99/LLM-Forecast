Posted: 1 day ago
The Canada Research Coordinating Committee (CRCC) has played a crucial role in strengthening Canada's response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing federal support for the research community and evidence-based decision-making. They oversee the Canada Research Continuity Emergency Fund (CRCEF), offering $450 million to universities and health research institutions to maintain essential research activities. The CRCC also allocated $7 million to the initial COVID-19 research response through the New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) and extended deadlines and provided additional funding for early career researchers. They coordinated with the International Development Research Centre and the Public Health Agency of Canada to share insights and accelerate information-sharing between government and academia through the CanCOVID platform. These actions have helped sustain research efforts and informed COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and responses.

Title: The Economic Impact of Travel Restrictions on the Canadian Economy due to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 on the Canadian economy. The analysis uses input-output multipliers to estimate the economy-wide effects, considering the interdependency between the tourism industry and other sectors. The results suggest that the restrictions could have a significant economic impact, with a potential GDP loss of up to $37 billion, or 1.7% of total real GDP in 2019. The impact on employment is also notable, with up to 549,000 jobs at risk. The analysis considers several scenarios with different timelines for lifting restrictions and varying recovery paths. The longer the restrictions remain in place, and the slower the recovery, the larger the potential economic impact. The pandemic is expected to have a major effect on the Canadian economy, with forecasted declines in GDP of 8% to 9.4% in 2020. The travel restrictions are estimated to contribute significantly to this decline, accounting for about 14% to 20% of the overall drop in GDP. The article highlights the potential economic consequences of the COVID-19 containment measures and underscores the vulnerability of the tourism industry to such disruptions. However, it is important to note that the analysis is static and does not account for behavioral changes or dynamic adjustments by consumers, businesses, and governments. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered: Infection rate: The number of new COVID-19 cases in the population. Hospitalization rate: The percentage of infected individuals who require hospitalization. Length of stay: The average number of days a COVID-19 patient spends in the hospital. Available hospital capacity: The number of beds and healthcare resources available to treat COVID-19 patients. By analyzing these factors and using data on the current infection rate and hospitalization rate, it is possible to make predictions about future hospitalization needs. For example, if the infection rate is increasing and the hospitalization rate remains constant, the number of hospitalizations can be expected to rise proportionally. Additionally, if the length of stay for COVID-19 patients increases due to more severe cases or complications, this will also impact hospitalization forecasts. It is crucial to monitor these factors and adjust predictions accordingly to ensure that healthcare systems are prepared and have the necessary resources to handle COVID-19 patients effectively.

Title: 7 months into pandemic, Quebec overhauls COVID-19 screening strategy
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The Quebec government has replaced the firm in charge of its COVID-19 screening system with a new system developed by Deloitte for a one-year contract worth $12.4 million. The new system will allow people to use a self-assessment tool online and schedule COVID-19 tests near their homes. Negative test results will be sent via text message or email to free up nursing personnel for COVID testing and contact tracing. The system, called Health Connect, is currently being tested in two regional health agencies and is expected to be implemented province-wide in the next six to eight weeks. The government has the option to cancel the contract if it is not satisfied with the results after 30 days.

Title: The startling impact of COVID-19 on immigrant women in the workforce
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities, particularly for immigrant women in the workforce. While the pandemic has negatively impacted all demographic groups, the effects on immigrant women have been disproportionately severe. Here are the key facts and findings from the article: Between May 2019 and May 2020, the employment rates for immigrant women (who arrived in Canada more than 10 years ago) dropped by 12.2%, compared to 7-8% for Canadian-born individuals and immigrant men. The unemployment rate for immigrant women increased by around 7 percentage points during the same period, compared to a 4.5-point increase for Canadian-born and immigrant men. University-educated immigrant women experienced the highest unemployment rates (12.6% in May 2020), a 7.3-point increase from the previous year. Their Canadian-born counterparts had an unemployment rate of only 5%. Immigrant women working in the service sector, particularly in retail trade, hospitality, and information/culture/recreation, were hit hard by shutdowns. Their unemployment rates increased significantly more than those of Canadian-born women. Even as the economy recovers, immigrant women are still further from pre-pandemic employment levels compared to men and other Canadian women. The precariousness of immigrant women's work, including hourly jobs, weak labor contracts, and underemployment in low-skill/part-time/high-risk occupations, contributes to their disproportionate impact. The lack of recognition of foreign credentials, lack of Canadian work experience, and limited access to social capital and professional networks are longstanding challenges for immigrant women in the workforce. Racialized immigrant women face additional systemic biases in hiring and advancement due to their race or ethnicity. As the Canadian government's financial support winds down, there is a need for new policy instruments to support an economic recovery that ensures equality of opportunities for all workers. Investing in the green economy and promoting "shovel-worthy" projects that address social value and utilize diverse talent can help ensure a more inclusive recovery. Upskilling and retraining initiatives are necessary to improve the employment outcomes of displaced workers, particularly immigrant and racialized women, who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. In conclusion, the article emphasizes the need to address the inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic and ensure that immigrant women, especially racialized and newcomer women, are not left behind in the post-COVID economic recovery.

Title: Some vaccines should be mandatory but not COVID-19, says U of A expert
Publisher: Folio - University of Alberta
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
While Canada should have a mandatory vaccination policy for childhood infectious diseases with available vaccines, this approach may not be as effective for COVID-19 due to potential objections and complexities. Readiness and willingness for COVID-19 vaccination are influenced by factors such as disease presence and impact, with countries severely affected by the pandemic likely to be more accepting of measures to control it. Policy makers should address readiness concerns and provide clear information about vaccine production, safety, and efficacy to increase vaccination uptake. However, mandatory COVID-19 vaccination may face challenges due to genuine fears about accelerated vaccine development and distribution, especially among racialized populations and communities of color. Ensuring equitable access to the vaccine globally and within Canada is crucial, considering the disproportionate impact on certain communities.

Title: COVID-19 takes toll on physical health of young Canadians, scientists, school board find
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of Canadian children and the resulting challenges for school physical education programs. Here are the key points: Only five per cent of Canadian children met the basic physical activity guidelines during the early stages of the pandemic, indicating a significant decrease in physical activity. Physical distancing measures and remote learning have contributed to increased sedentary time for children, leading to concerns about their health and well-being. School boards, such as the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), have recognized the issue and are adjusting their physical education programs. TDSB gym teachers have reported that students' physical activity levels are alarming, with many students getting out of breath immediately. Phys-ed teachers are finding creative ways to engage students in physical activity, such as demonstrating exercises through laptop screens and encouraging activities like juggling to practice movement skills. National health guidelines recommend that children and youth aged 5-17 years engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily, get sufficient sleep (9-11 hours for ages 5-13 and 8-10 hours for ages 14-17), and limit recreational screen time to no more than two hours per day. A study conducted by Mark Tremblay and his team in April 2020, about a month after the pandemic was declared in Canada, found that only three per cent of children were meeting healthy living behaviour guidelines. This puts them at increased risk of physical and mental health issues. Factors that can encourage healthy movement behaviours outside of school include parental encouragement, parents playing actively with their children, and dog ownership. Tremblay emphasizes that while staying home is important during the pandemic, it doesn't mean staying inside, and children should still find ways to be physically active. The scientists plan to conduct another survey in early November to assess any changes in children's physical activity levels as the pandemic continues. This article highlights the importance of physical activity for children's health and the challenges of maintaining adequate activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in physical activity among Canadian children is concerning, and it will be interesting to see the results of the follow-up survey to gauge any improvements or further declines in physical activity as the pandemic situation evolves.

Title: Fact Sheet: DHS Measures on the Border to Limit the Further Spread of Coronavirus
Publisher: Homeland Security
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: To limit the spread of COVID-19, the U.S. has agreed with Canada and Mexico to restrict non-essential travel across borders. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also immediately return illegal immigrants to their countries of origin to prevent the spread of the virus in detention facilities. These measures were implemented on April 20, 2020, and have been extended multiple times throughout the pandemic. The US-Canada land border supports a significant economic relationship, with $1.7 billion in daily cross-border trade. The restriction on non-essential travel between the two countries aims to protect the health of citizens while preserving supply chains for essential goods. The definition of "non-essential" travel includes tourism and recreational activities. Similarly, the U.S.-Mexico border restrictions aim to protect bilateral trade and ensure the health and safety of citizens in both countries. Essential travel, such as trade and critical services, will continue unimpeded. CBP, as the first line of defense at the borders, is implementing measures to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into its facilities. Aliens subject to the order will be turned away from ports of entry, and those who cross illegally will be returned to their countries of last transit to prevent the spread of the virus in detention facilities. This is crucial due to the human-to-human transmission nature of the virus and the lack of adequate quarantine and treatment capabilities in CBP facilities. From October 2019 to February 2020, over 190,000 migrants from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases were apprehended or denied entry at the U.S. Southwest border. CBP apprehends between 7,000 and 9,000 individuals per week between ports of entry, highlighting the potential for rapid spread in detention facilities. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and certain other travelers are exempt from these restrictions and will undergo standard processing and potential CDC medical screening at U.S. ports of entry. The measures were initially implemented on March 21, 2020, and have been extended multiple times, with the latest extension until November 21, 2020. These border restrictions and measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities could help reduce the number of hospitalizations due to the virus. By limiting non-essential travel and returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin, the potential strain on healthcare resources in border regions may be mitigated.
