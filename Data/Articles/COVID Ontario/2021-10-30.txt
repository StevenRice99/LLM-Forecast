Relevant article for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Key points:
68% of pregnant women in Ontario have received at least one dose of a vaccine (Oct 3).
60% are fully vaccinated.
Hospitalization rates among pregnant women with COVID-19 are higher: 25 hospitalizations reported by Hamilton Health Sciences from March 2020 to August 2021.
A study found that pregnant individuals are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 40% more likely to be admitted to the ICU if they contract COVID-19.

Title: Average Costs for a COVID-19 Hospital Stay Top $400,000 in Some States: Study
Publisher: Money
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The average cost of a noncomplex COVID-19 hospitalization is over $100,000 in some states (similar to the costs in Ontario).
Complex cases require ICU admission and/or a ventilator, costing up to $472,213.
Location matters: costs vary by state due to factors like cost of living, labor prices, malpractice insurance, and negotiations between providers and insurers.
In Canada, healthcare is publicly funded, but hospitalization costs for COVID-19 may still be significant (no specific data provided).
The article mentions that health insurance companies are phasing out cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 patients, which could lead to more people receiving significant medical bills for their treatment.

Title: Why 'waning immunity' from COVID-19 vaccines isn't as bad as it sounds
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the topic of breakthrough infections and waning immunity after full vaccination against COVID-19. Despite some individuals experiencing severe outcomes or death from COVID-19 two weeks after their second vaccine shot, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines remains high.
According to Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) data, fully vaccinated Canadians are 79 per cent less likely to be hospitalized and 64 per cent less likely to die from COVID-19. However, the article highlights that underlying conditions play a significant role in breakthrough infections, with older, frailer individuals living with comorbidities being at increased risk.
A recent study from the Toronto-based Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute found much lower levels of neutralizing antibodies in elderly patients, which may explain their higher risk of breakthrough infections. Additionally, immunocompromised groups, such as transplant patients and people with certain types of cancers, have shown declining protection from COVID-19 vaccines.
The article also discusses the debate surrounding COVID-19 booster shots, with some experts recommending them for long-term care residents due to their increased vulnerability. However, it is suggested that boosters may not be necessary for the general population at this time, as overall vaccine effectiveness remains high and waning immunity can be addressed through continued public health measures.
Key points from the article include:
Fully vaccinated Canadians are 79 per cent less likely to be hospitalized and 64 per cent less likely to die from COVID-19.
Underlying conditions play a significant role in breakthrough infections, with older, frailer individuals being at increased risk.
Immunocompromised groups have shown declining protection from COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters may not be necessary for the general population at this time.
Continued public health measures can address waning immunity and prevent severe outcomes.
