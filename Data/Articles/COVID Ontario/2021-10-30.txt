Title: Why 'waning immunity' from COVID-19 vaccines isn't as bad as it sounds

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Antibodies from COVID-19 vaccines do decline over time, but this is not unexpected and does not necessarily mean that the immune system's protection against the virus is waning. Memory B cells, which are created after vaccination, continue to learn how to fend off the virus months after vaccination and are actually getting better at it over time. Breakthrough infections do not necessarily indicate waning immunity, and reports of waning immunity may lack important context and data on who is seriously affected and why. In Ontario, 94.7% of all COVID-19 cases since December 14 have been among those not fully vaccinated, as well as 95.8% of hospitalizations and 94.3% of deaths. Fully vaccinated Canadians who do get COVID-19 are 79% less likely to be hospitalized and 64% less likely to die. Key information on the age, underlying health conditions, or specific vaccine combination administered to those who were hospitalized or died from COVID-19 two weeks after their second shot is not available in Canada due to health privacy laws. Older, frailer Canadians living with comorbidities in congregate settings, such as long-term care facilities, are at increased risk of breakthrough infections because their antibody levels drop "much faster" than in the general population. Boosters for the general population are considered "premature" in Canada, and experts recommend waiting and seeing when waning immunity becomes a concern before administering boosters.
