Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are at an increased risk of severe illness and adverse outcomes. In Alberta, Canada, an unvaccinated pregnant woman died from a COVID-19-related infection while in the ICU, and her baby survived. The province's chief medical officer, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, urged pregnant individuals to get vaccinated, citing data that pregnant women with COVID-19 are five times more likely to be hospitalized and 10 times more likely to require intensive care. Dr. Eliana Castillo, who studies COVID-19 in pregnancy, noted a rise in unvaccinated pregnant women admitted to ICUs as the pandemic surges, with more severe infections and complications in the recent delta wave. During the first 13 months of the pandemic, 7 unvaccinated pregnant women were admitted to Alberta ICUs, while 6 were admitted in the third wave (May to July 2021). In August 2021, 6 unvaccinated pregnant women were admitted to the ICU, indicating a worsening trend. COVID-19 in pregnancy can lead to preterm births and developmental issues in babies, and severe cases may require urgent C-sections. Doctors emphasize that vaccines are safe for pregnant women and protect both mother and baby, debunking fears about infertility and birth defects.

Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article provides an update on the COVID-19 situation in New Brunswick, Canada, as of Friday, including the transition of the Horizon and Vitalité health networks to the orange alert level due to a decrease in new and active cases, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions. Here are the key points to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Hospitalizations: Twenty-eight people are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19, a decrease from 31. Of these, 17 patients are in intensive care, an increase of one. Alert Level Transition: The move to the orange alert level will result in an increase in services, with Vitalité stating that they believe they can enhance ambulatory care, medical imaging, and surgical services. CUPE Strike Impact: Vitalité warns that a potential strike by CUPE healthcare workers could force them to change their alert level again, as it would impact their regular activities. Visitor Restrictions: Both Horizon and Vitalité will maintain red alert level visitor restrictions, allowing only patients with a designated support person to have visitors. Regional Breakdown: The article provides a detailed breakdown of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and intensive care admissions for each health region in New Brunswick. Circuit Breaker Measures: A two-week COVID-19 circuit breaker has been implemented for most of Zone 2 (Saint John region), with restrictions on private gatherings and non-essential travel. This is in response to an increase in new infections in the area. Case Breakdown: Of the 48 new cases reported on Friday, 56% are unvaccinated, 25% are partially vaccinated, and 19% are fully vaccinated. Contact Tracing: Public Health continues to conduct contact tracing despite the surge in cases, and additional resources have been allocated to support this effort. Vitalité Worker Vaccination: As of October 25, 87% of Vitalité's 8,000 employees are fully vaccinated, and 91% have received their first dose. However, as of November 19, unvaccinated workers without a medical exemption will be placed on unpaid leave. Nova Scotia Travel Rules: Starting November 1, travelers aged 12 to 18 entering Nova Scotia will have their self-isolation requirements based on their own vaccination status, rather than that of their accompanying adult. School and Child-Care Cases: Three cases have been confirmed at two schools in the Saint John region, including Island View School and Simonds High School. Additionally, a case has been identified at St. Joseph's Community Preschool and Afterschool Program.

Title: New COVID-19 modelling projects continued downward trend for Alberta
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: According to new modelling, COVID-19 hospitalizations and daily cases in Alberta, Canada, are projected to decline if public health measures are maintained. University of Victoria physics professor Dean Karlen, a member of British Columbia's independent COVID-19 modelling group, notes that the decline is faster than in neighbouring B.C., with a drop of about 3-4% per day. The analysis suggests that infections peaked during the fourth wave, nearly overwhelming Alberta's healthcare system. The implementation of public health measures, including a proof-of-vaccination program, in mid-September, is credited for the turnaround. However, Karlen cautions that case counts are no longer a reliable indicator due to reduced testing and contact tracing, and modelling is now based on hospitalizations. While the current trend is positive, Craig Jenne, an infectious diseases expert, warns that several variables could influence the occurrence of a fifth wave, including indoor gatherings during winter and the emergence of new variants. Jenne emphasizes the need to maintain public health measures and increase vaccination coverage, especially in the under-12 population, to prevent another spike in cases.

Title: UBCO researchers test alternate COVID-19 screening method
Publisher: UBC Okanagan News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers at UBC Okanagan have developed a new method for COVID-19 testing using artificial intelligence and X-ray images, called CORONA-Net. The viral test and the antibody test are the two prevalent methods for COVID-19 testing, but they have limitations such as cost and availability, especially in countries without extensive PCR testing capacity. As a solution, CORONA-Net uses chest X-ray images and deep learning neural networks to detect COVID-19 infections quickly and accurately. According to the World Health Organization, chest imaging is an effective method for detecting COVID-19-related clinical symptoms. CORONA-Net can differentiate between X-ray images of individuals with COVID-19 and those without the disease, thanks to datasets of X-rays from individuals with COVID-19-induced pneumonia, pneumonia caused by other diseases, and healthy individuals. The system has achieved over 95% accuracy in classifying COVID-19 cases from digital chest X-ray images, and its accuracy will continue to improve as the dataset expands. CORONA-Net can also self-improve and learn over time, increasing its sensitivity and positive predictive value. The system has shown 100% sensitivity to the COVID-19 class, 95% sensitivity to the pneumonia class, and 95% sensitivity to the normal class in testing. CORONA-Net offers a valuable tool for diagnosing COVID-19 using chest X-rays, providing accurate and promising results for healthcare systems, especially in challenging-to-test individuals. The system has been published in the Journal of Imaging and cited several times, indicating its potential impact and usefulness in the ongoing pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS): updated statement regarding myocarditis and pericarditis reported with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) released a statement regarding rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, particularly in younger men after the second dose. US data estimates a higher crude reporting rate in males (40.6 cases per million) compared to females (4.2 cases per million) aged 12-29 years. There is a likely causal association between these conditions and the mRNA vaccines. Some Nordic countries temporarily paused the use of the Moderna mRNA vaccine or recommended the Pfizer vaccine preferentially for younger individuals due to preliminary results of a Nordic study. However, other countries continue to recommend either vaccine for adolescents and young adults. The GACVS subcommittee has reviewed data from multiple countries and notes that some suggest a higher incidence of myocarditis after the Moderna vaccine in young males, but the overall risk is small. Myocarditis can also occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the benefits of mRNA vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 are clear. Countries should continue to monitor reports of myocarditis and pericarditis and consider the benefits of immunization in their context when developing COVID-19 policies. The immediate course of these conditions following vaccination is generally mild and responsive to treatment, but long-term follow-up is ongoing. Vaccinated individuals should seek medical attention if they experience symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis.

Title: Researchers confirm how to decontaminate and reuse masks during COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: University of Alberta
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The study reveals two effective methods for sterilizing disposable masks: heat treatment and methylene blue treatment with light. These methods can potentially allow healthcare workers to reuse masks, especially in areas with limited resources. Both methods effectively inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various types of masks, including N95 respirators and cotton masks. The heat treatment involved exposing masks to 65-75 degrees Celsius in humid air for 15 minutes, while the methylene blue treatment involved using the compound commonly used in blood banks along with bright light. The latter method may be slightly preferable as heat can damage mask elastic straps. This study provides valuable guidance for health authorities, ensuring that any treatment does not compromise the protective qualities of the masks. Ensuring effective sterilization of masks can help reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers and alleviate PPE shortages in some regions. While the focus is on mask sterilization, this does not provide a full picture of COVID-19 hospitalizations, which are influenced by various factors, including vaccination rates, public health measures, and the availability of intensive care resources.

Title: ‘These diseases are now vaccine-preventable’: the parallels between polio and COVID-19
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article highlights the similarities between polio, a highly infectious disease that spread in the first half of the 20th century, and COVID-19, the current coronavirus pandemic. Both diseases are caused by viruses and are now vaccine-preventable. However, vaccine hesitancy exists for both diseases, with some people reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine and similar skepticism when the polio vaccine was first introduced in the 1950s. The article also notes that Canada was certified polio-free in 1994, and the success of polio vaccination has led to the eradication of two out of three strains of the virus worldwide. As of 2020, wild poliovirus type 1 still affects Pakistan and Afghanistan. The virtual eradication of polio through vaccination is described as one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine and public health. The article argues that many people who decline the COVID-19 vaccine are actually benefiting from the billions of people globally who are inoculated against other diseases, including polio.

Title: The Great COVID-19 Immunity Test Kit
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the idea of a test that can predict an individual's risk of contracting COVID-19 and their likelihood of transmitting it to others. While the concept may seem appealing, the author explains that it is not based on scientific reality. The author explores the complexity of the immune system and how it interacts with the COVID-19 virus, highlighting that simply measuring antibody levels is not a reliable indicator of immunity. Reinfection, for instance, is possible but rare. The article also includes an interview with Professor Judith Mandl, an expert in immune cell dynamics. Professor Mandl emphasizes that there is still much to understand about the 'correlates' of protection, including the role of antibody levels and T-cell responses. She also clarifies that testing the amount of virus in saliva is not an effective way to determine contagiousness, as that level can change rapidly. In conclusion, the author emphasizes that the best way to evaluate COVID-19 risk is by considering health risk factors, the prevalence of the virus in the local area, the nature of the activity, and vaccination status. While apps can provide rough estimates, they cannot offer guarantees. Understanding and accepting the complexities of risk assessment is crucial, especially during a pandemic involving a constantly evolving virus.
