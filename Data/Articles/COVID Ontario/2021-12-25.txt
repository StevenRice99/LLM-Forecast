Title: COVID-19 in Canada: Year-end Update on Social and Economic Impacts
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some critical facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada: Vaccination and Unintended Health Impacts: Vaccination rates have increased due to provincial vaccine passport requirements, but rates vary across Canada. As of December 4, 2021, 89.6% of Canadians aged 12+ had received at least one dose, and 86.7% were fully vaccinated. The pandemic caused excess deaths, with a 5% increase from March 2020 to May 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This includes deaths from COVID-19 and other causes like poisonings and opioid overdoses, especially in those under 65. Opioid overdoses increased by 88% from April 2020 to March 2021 compared to the previous year, with the majority of deaths among young adults (20-49) and in BC, Alberta, and Ontario. The pandemic has negatively impacted mental health, with a quarter of Canadians reporting high stress levels and nearly half saying their stress is worse than pre-pandemic. Demographic Impacts: Canada's population growth in 2020 was the lowest since 1945 due to decreased immigration and increased deaths. Deaths surpassed 300,000 for the first time, a 7% increase from 2019. Lower immigration during the pandemic will impact employment, as international migration usually contributes significantly to population growth. Economic Recovery: Economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the recovery is uneven across industries. Employment has rebounded, but high job vacancies indicate a mismatch between labor supply and demand. Rising prices and input costs are pressuring businesses and consumers, with consumer inflation accelerating at the fastest pace since 2003, outpacing wage growth. These factors, including vaccination rates, excess deaths, mental health issues, population changes, and economic challenges, will influence COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada. The impact of the Omicron variant and the potential for new restrictions will also be critical in forecasting hospitalizations.

Title: Supply chain resilience: How are pandemic-related disruptions reshaping managerial thinking?
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global supply chains, revealing the weaknesses in many companies' business continuity plans. The pandemic has been characterized by a series of major shocks to logistical systems, with prolonged disruptions and a wide geographical reach. Supply chain leaders acknowledge that response times to the pandemic could have been improved and that the agility of supply chain management was tested. Internal and external communications, including with suppliers, customers, and logistics providers, could have been better to facilitate a more coordinated response to disruptions. The mental well-being of managers and employees during a pandemic is important for maintaining emotional resilience and effective decision-making. Standard methods to increase supply chain resilience include localized sourcing, supplier base diversification, and strategic inventory management. The pandemic is expected to accelerate automation and technological advancements in logistics, such as augmented reality and 3D printing. Managers recognize the need for deeper knowledge of upstream supply chains to assess vulnerability and exposure to global risks. Visibility beyond tier-one and tier-two suppliers is crucial due to the complexity and geographical extent of modern value chains. The pandemic may lead to a new era of supply chain collaboration, enabling better risk management and sustainability benefits. To prepare for future disruptions, managers need to enhance their ideation and scenario-building skills, as well as their ability to model changing risk profiles during a prolonged crisis. Effective management of virtual and mixed teams is becoming a core competence in the post-pandemic work environment, requiring digital literacy and leadership skills. While the article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on supply chains and managerial responses, it does not directly provide facts or data that can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the insights into supply chain disruptions and the need for improved resilience could indirectly influence the availability and distribution of medical resources, which could have an impact on hospitalization rates during the pandemic.

Title: Social media responses to COVID-19 vaccine news posted by Canadian news organizations, and recommendations to counter vaccine hesitancy, CCDR 47(12)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
This article examines social media responses to COVID-19 vaccine news posted by Canadian news organizations to understand the perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and intentions of Canadians toward COVID-19 vaccines. The analysis identified four main themes: concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, conspiracy theories stemming from mistrust, beliefs that the vaccine is unnecessary, and trust in vaccines as a safe solution. Theme 1: COVID-19 Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Concerns A significant number of commenters expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, with many believing that the development process was rushed due to political pressures. Some stated they would wait for others to take the vaccine first to ensure its safety, while others questioned the ingredients and potential side effects. A few commenters also raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines against new COVID-19 variants. Theme 2: Conspiracy Theories Stemming from Mistrust in Government and Organizations A prominent theme in the comments was conspiracy theories and mistrust in governments, pharmaceutical companies, and health organizations. Many commenters believed that COVID-19 was a hoax or exaggerated by the media, while others claimed that the vaccine was a tool for population control or a way for governments to track citizens. Some also questioned the motives of health organizations and scientists, accusing them of being influenced by financial gains or political agendas. Theme 3: COVID-19 Vaccine is Unnecessary as the Virus is Not Dangerous A significant number of commenters believed that the COVID-19 virus was not dangerous enough to warrant a vaccine. Some argued that the survival rate was high, especially for healthy individuals, and that the focus should be on protecting vulnerable populations instead of vaccinating everyone. Others expressed concerns about the potential impact of the vaccine on natural immunity or believed that natural immunity was sufficient to fight the virus. Theme 4: Trust in COVID-19 Vaccines as a Safe Solution Despite the presence of negative sentiments, a portion of commenters expressed trust in COVID-19 vaccines and believed that they were necessary to protect themselves and others. Some shared their personal experiences with the vaccine, stating that they did not experience any significant side effects. Others emphasized the importance of vaccines in controlling the spread of the virus and returning to normal life. Based on these themes, the article provides key communication recommendations for promoting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. These include infographics highlighting the benefits of vaccination, public education about vaccine contents and safety, and sharing personal stories to elicit an emotional connection. The authors also suggest leveraging the public's trust in healthcare professionals to act as liaisons between public health authorities and the Canadian public. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide direct insights. However, the themes identified can help understand the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, which could impact hospitalization rates. If a significant portion of the population delays or refuses vaccination due to safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or the perception that the virus is not dangerous, it could lead to higher infection rates and subsequently, higher hospitalization rates.

Title: Income inequality and COVID-19: We are in the same storm, but not in the same boat
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the impact of income inequality on COVID-19 infection and death rates within countries, including Canada. Researchers from economics and epidemiology fields studied the relationship between inequality and health during the pre-vaccine phase of the pandemic. They found that higher income inequality within a country was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, including more deaths and cases. The first study focused on 22 high-income countries and found that higher income inequality was linked to more COVID-19 deaths across all age groups. The second study looked at 127 countries with varying income levels and found a strong association between COVID-19 cases, deaths, and inequality. The article also mentions that lower-income groups tend to have lower vaccination rates. Reducing income inequality can increase overall welfare and improve economic performance and public health. Canada can focus on improving systems and policies that exacerbate inequality and invest more in people and social programs to achieve greater equality.

Title: Feature: Novel approach to COVID-19 vaccine shows early promise
Publisher: Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses a novel approach to developing a COVID-19 vaccine by a team at Western University, which has shown promising early results in inducing a robust immune response. The vaccine uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a vector to deliver the full COVID-19 spike protein gene into the body's cells. What sets this vaccine apart is the modification of the rVSV vector to have a mixed envelope, which allows for booster shots since the body doesn't develop full immunity to the vector virus. This approach has shown to produce higher quantities of spike proteins, triggering a stronger immune response and significantly reducing lung damage in mouse models. The development of new and more efficient vaccines is crucial in the push for global vaccine equity and addressing new variants of the virus. The goal is to achieve worldwide herd immunity, which requires vaccinating about 90% of the global population, or approximately 14 billion doses with a two-dose approach. This second-generation vector-based vaccine aims to provide long-lasting and strong protection against all variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is critical to ending the pandemic.

Quebec is closing schools, bars, gyms, and movie theaters to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, which is doubling every few days. The health minister, Christian Dube, warned that the situation is critical and that the healthcare system is already overwhelmed. Schools are closing early, with students switching to remote learning until January 10th. Non-essential businesses are also closing, and restaurants are reducing capacity and limiting hours. With hospitalizations already over half of the province's capacity, Dube warned that more measures may be needed. The severity of Omicron is unknown, but its high transmission rate will lead to more hospitalizations. Quebec is trying to speed up booster shots, but there is a shortage of staff to administer them.

Publisher: The Narwhal
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the poor working conditions and lack of labor protections for migrant farmworkers in Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the story of Damion, a Jamaican worker who experienced skin irritation and peeling after his workplace, Lakeside Produce, dusted their greenhouses with hydrated lime powder. Multiple workers reported side effects from the powder and felt that their employer was not taking their health and safety concerns seriously. This incident led to a strike, with workers demanding the removal of the powder. The article also mentions that migrant workers were already facing difficult working and living conditions before the pandemic, with little government oversight or labor protections. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues, with workers reporting that they were singled out for lockdowns and quarantines that didn't apply to Canadian workers. There were also concerns about COVID-19 outbreaks in cramped employer-provided housing and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). As of October 2021, there had been over 1,100 COVID-19 cases and 5 deaths among migrant farmworkers in Ontario that year. The federal government's inspections of quarantine accommodations and housing for seasonal agricultural workers were also criticized in the article, with a report from the auditor general detailing inadequate inspections and bureaucratic backlog that left workers vulnerable. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Canada's agricultural sector has made record profits this year. Overall, the article highlights the systemic issues and lack of labor protections faced by migrant farmworkers in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need for improved working conditions and government oversight to address these issues.
