Title: How level of understanding and type of used sources relate to adherence to COVID-19 public health measures in Canada
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This research article examines the relationship between Canadians' understanding of COVID-19 information, their information sources, and their adherence to public health measures during the first year of the pandemic. The study used latent trajectories to model adherence levels, finding that a small group of individuals (2.5-6.0%) consistently displayed low adherence to social distancing, contact limitation, and mask-wearing measures. The results indicate that individuals' perceived understanding of COVID-19 information positively correlated with their adherence to public health measures. Additionally, the use of informal information sources was linked to lower adherence, particularly for social distancing and contact limitation. The study highlights the importance of clear and coherent communication from governments and public health agencies to improve understanding and adherence. While education level influenced knowledge and understanding, it had less of an impact on promoting adherence compared to other factors. The study's strengths include its longitudinal design and control variables, while limitations include the self-reported nature of adherence and understanding measures, and the lack of standardized assessment tools for COVID-19-related concepts.

Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare labor force in Canada, focusing on employment quality and job satisfaction. The study uses data from the Labour Force Survey and looks at three main occupational groups: nurses, personal support workers/care aides (PSWs), and other healthcare workers. Key findings include: 1. Absences due to personal illness or disability among healthcare workers increased during the pandemic, with nurses missing an average of 19.5 days in 2020 (+4.6 days compared to 2019). 2. Healthcare employees are working longer hours, with an increase in both the proportion of employees working overtime and the number of overtime hours worked. In 2022, 7.9% of full-time healthcare employees reported working 49 or more hours per week. 3. In 2022, job vacancies for healthcare occupations reached an all-time high of 95,800, more than double the number in 2019. Vacancies in nursing and PSWs accounted for two-thirds of all vacancies. 4. In August 2022, healthcare workers were just as likely as non-healthcare workers to report intending to leave their jobs within the next year. Among those intending to leave, being overworked was cited as the main reason. 5. Wages for nurses in the public sector struggled to keep up with price growth, with a real wage decline of 1.4% from 2019 to 2022. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors could be important: 1. Absenteeism due to illness or disability: High absenteeism rates among healthcare workers, particularly nurses, could impact the availability of staff to provide care for patients. This could be exacerbated by overtime and long working hours, leading to increased burnout and fatigue. 2. Healthcare worker retention: The intention to leave among healthcare workers, especially when citing being overworked as the main reason, could indicate future staffing shortages. This may be mitigated by addressing overtime and long working hours, as well as providing competitive wages to retain healthcare workers. 3. Vaccination and infection rates: The impact of COVID-19 infections on healthcare workers, including their ability to work, depends on vaccination rates and the severity of emerging variants. Infection rates in the general population can also impact healthcare worker absences and demand for healthcare services. 4. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of the healthcare system to manage increased demand, including through innovation in healthcare delivery and staffing strategies, will influence the number of hospitalizations that can be accommodated. 5. Public health measures: The implementation or relaxation of public health measures can impact infection rates and, subsequently, hospitalizations. This includes measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, and restrictions on gatherings.

Title: Back-to-school booster? What to know about fall COVID-19 vaccine guidance - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Experts warn that COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses are likely to surge again in the fall as schools reopen in Canada. While COVID-19 cases have decreased or stabilized, this trajectory may change, especially with the rise of the new Omicron subvariant EG.5. Scientists are monitoring this subvariant, which is already dominant in the US and has been detected in Canada. Vaccinations, masking, and testing are crucial to prevent a surge in cases and hospitalizations. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends a COVID-19 booster for those aged 5+ if it's been at least 6 months since their last dose or infection. An Omicron-specific bivalent vaccine is available, and new formulations are expected in the fall. Boosters are especially important for children with underlying medical conditions. Additionally, experts warn of a potential "tridemic" with COVID-19, flu, and RSV. Influenza vaccine is recommended for children over 6 months, and a new RSV vaccine has been approved for adults over 60, with a drug also authorized to protect babies from serious illness.

Title: A new COVID-19 variant is spreading in Quebec—here is the latest guidance
Publisher: CTV News Montreal
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The latest COVID-19 variant, EG.5 (Eris), is becoming more prevalent in Quebec and currently accounts for the highest percentage of reported cases in the province. This variant, an offshoot of the XBB strain, has been designated a variant of interest by the WHO due to its increased contagiousness. While it is not yet clear if it causes severe respiratory disease, vaccine protection is available. Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist, emphasizes the importance of having all three vaccine doses, including the bivalent vaccine, as it offers some protection against the XBB subfamily, which includes EG.5. To prepare for the fall, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends Canadians receive a booster if it has been at least six months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection. The upcoming vaccine campaign will include a formulation targeting the XBB subfamily. Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, another infectious disease specialist, warns that those who have not been infected or boosted in the past year may be more susceptible to illness and Long COVID. Regarding COVID-19 measures, Quebec has lifted most restrictions, including mask requirements for healthcare workers, and now encourages a "common-sense" approach. Individuals with symptoms are advised to stay home if they have a fever and wear a mask if they have a cough, sore throat, or congestion. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the prevalence of the new variant, vaccination rates, and the potential impact of Long COVID on healthcare resources. Monitoring the spread of EG.5 and tracking vaccination rates, especially among vulnerable populations, will be crucial in predicting and managing hospitalizations. Additionally, the possibility of Long COVID contributing to an increase in hospitalizations should be considered, as Dr. Sharkawy notes. Here are some key facts from the article to assist in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: EG.5 is an offshoot of the XBB strain and is now the dominant variant in Quebec, with 18% of cases as of mid-July. The WHO has designated EG.5 a variant of interest due to its increased contagiousness. Vaccine protection is available, but a booster dose, including the bivalent vaccine, is important for optimal protection. NACI recommends a booster for Canadians if it has been at least six months since their last dose or infection. The upcoming vaccine campaign will include a formulation targeting the XBB subfamily. Unvaccinated or unboosted individuals who have also not been infected recently may be more susceptible to illness and Long COVID. Quebec has lifted most COVID-19 restrictions but encourages individuals with symptoms to stay home if they have a fever and wear masks if they have respiratory symptoms. Monitoring the spread of EG.5, tracking vaccination rates, and considering the impact of Long COVID may help forecast hospitalizations.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, along with some key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The new Omicron subvariant EG.5 has been detected in Manitoba, Canada, according to provincial health authorities. This subvariant has been circulating in Canada since at least May, and it has been designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. The latest data shows that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Manitoba remain low, with only six admissions, including one to intensive care, during the most recent reporting period. However, there were an additional 19 hospital admissions in the previous two weeks of July, indicating a potential upward trend. Wastewater surveillance data suggests a slight rise in COVID-19 activity in some parts of Winnipeg. The vaccination rate in Manitoba is relatively high, with 77.4% of residents having received at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, it is important to monitor the spread of the new subvariant EG.5 and its impact on hospitalizations, especially in areas with lower vaccination rates or where wastewater surveillance data indicates increasing virus circulation. Overall, while COVID-19 hospitalizations in Manitoba are currently low, the presence of the new subvariant and the slight increase in cases and wastewater virus levels could be factors to watch for in forecasting future hospitalization trends.

Title: What to know about the new COVID-19 variant EG.5
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 variant EG.5, a descendant of the Omicron strain, has become the dominant variant in the United States and is spreading to other countries, including Canada. While it has been classified as a "variant of interest" by the World Health Organization (WHO), the available evidence suggests that it does not pose a greater threat to public health compared to other circulating Omicron lineages. Symptoms of EG.5 are consistent with typical COVID-19 symptoms, and it is predicted to be less severe in vaccinated individuals compared to previous variants like Alpha and Delta. Globally, there has been a steady rise in EG.5 cases, with the variant making up 17.4% of weekly cases from July 17 to 23. In the US, it accounts for 17.3% of cases, while in Canada, two lineages of EG.5 together made up 36% of cases between July 30 and August 5. The lack of widespread testing in Canada makes it challenging to determine the exact number of EG.5 cases. Experts recommend that Canadians stay up-to-date with vaccines and boosters and consider additional protections like mask-wearing and staying home when sick to prevent the spread and reduce hospitalizations.

Here is a summary of the article: Researchers have identified a genetic variant, HLA-B15:01, that is associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. This variant is involved in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to the virus. The study found that individuals with this genetic variant may have T cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to seasonal coronaviruses, leading to a quicker immune response and the absence of symptoms. This discovery could guide the development of improved vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, providing a potential strategy for better protection against the disease. This research provides valuable insights into the role of genetics in COVID-19 infections and offers a possible explanation for why some individuals remain asymptomatic. By understanding how this genetic variant confers protection, scientists can work towards translating these mechanisms into effective preventive and therapeutic measures. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, this information could be used in combination with other epidemiological data and modeling techniques. Understanding the factors contributing to asymptomatic infections can help identify at-risk groups and guide public health strategies to reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
