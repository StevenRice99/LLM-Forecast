Title: COVID-19 activity risk calculator as a gamified public health intervention tool
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 risks:
Community transmission levels: The number of active cases has a close correlation with the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death.
Age: Older individuals (70+ years) have a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and death compared to younger individuals (30 years).
Vaccination: Vaccination with the first dose of Pfizer vaccine reduces the risk of infection, with further reduction with the second dose and booster dosage. However, the omicron variant is not significantly decreased by vaccination.
Mask type: Wearing a 2-layer woven nylon mask with a nose bridge reduces the risk of infection, while wearing an N95 respirator has a very high reduction in risk of infection.
These factors can be used to estimate COVID-19 risks and inform mitigation strategies.

Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary:
EG.5 variant has been detected in Canada since May 2023 and made up 19% of cases in the country between July 30 and August 5.
Public Health Ontario estimated that EG.5 will account for 30.5% of sequenced samples by August 5, indicating an increase in prevalence.
Dr. Angela Rasmussen stated that symptoms associated with EG.5 are similar to other Omicron subvariants, with a low public health risk and no reported changes in disease severity.
There is no clear evidence yet on how dangerous EG.5 could be, but it's expected to lead to hospitalizations and deaths eventually.
The new boosters will still provide protection against EG.5 since they target Omicron variants.
