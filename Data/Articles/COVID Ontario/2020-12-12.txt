The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: A small community in Renfrew County has experienced a significant outbreak with 54 cases of COVID-19 out of 212 people, resulting in a 50% positivity rate.

Despite the high number of cases, no one in the community has required hospitalization, with approximately 90 people showing symptoms. The community has limited interaction with the outside community, which may help contain the spread. The outbreak has significantly increased Renfrew County's seven-day average of cases per 100,000 people, from 1.8 to 15.6. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the potential for rapid spread in close-knit communities, the impact of external factors (such as visitors from other regions), and the effectiveness of containment measures.
