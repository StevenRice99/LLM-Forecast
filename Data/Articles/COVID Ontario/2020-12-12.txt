Title: 'Historic moment': Health Canada approves Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False

Canada has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, making it the third country in the world to do so. The vaccine will be distributed to Canadians through ultra-cold freezers at 14 medical facilities across the country. However, Canadians living in remote areas and the territories may have to wait until the Moderna vaccine is approved before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
Canada's approval process was expedited due to an emergency order, allowing Health Canada to review the vaccine's safety and efficacy more quickly than usual. The agency will closely monitor the vaccine's safety once it is on the market and take action if any concerns arise.
Pfizer has agreed to follow clinical trial participants for two years after their second dose and provide regular updates on the vaccine's quality, efficacy, and safety. Each province and territory will track who receives doses, and the federal government is considering an additional layer of national monitoring.
Canada has signed contracts guaranteeing access to 194 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines, with options to purchase up to 220 million more. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is one of four candidates being evaluated by Health Canada, along with the Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
COVID-19 vaccines will be offered to Canadians free of charge and are not mandatory. The approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is seen as a positive development in the fight against COVID-19, but officials caution that it is just one tool among many being used to combat the virus.
