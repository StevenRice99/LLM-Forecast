This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: The province is currently experiencing a peak in COVID-19 cases, but the duration of this peak is uncertain.

Current hospitalization numbers: + 945 people hospitalized with COVID-19. + 241 patients in ICUs (down from 252). + 191 patients on ventilators (down from 195). Long-term care homes are a major concern, with 150 outbreaks reported and over 2,500 residents testing positive for COVID-19. The province has 6,000 empty hospital beds and over 2,000 ventilators available, but is cautious about reopening due to the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system.
