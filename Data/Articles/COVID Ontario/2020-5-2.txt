Symptoms often show up within 5 days after infection (median incubation period: 5.1 days). Hospitalization typically occurs 2 days after shortness of breath appears, and ICU admission occurs around 10 days after symptoms first appear. Median duration of illness is approximately 20 days, with some patients recovering quickly and others experiencing a slow recovery lasting weeks or even months. These patterns can be used to inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
