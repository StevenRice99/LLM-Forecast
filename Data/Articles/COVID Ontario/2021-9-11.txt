TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Canada is currently in the midst of a fourth wave of COVID-19, fueled by the delta variant, with most cases and hospitalizations among the unvaccinated. Fully vaccinated foreign travelers are allowed to enter Canada without a 14-day quarantine requirement, but must have a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their scheduled flight or arrival at a land border crossing. The border test positivity rate for COVID-19 has remained low, with a 0.19% positivity rate for fully vaccinated travelers randomly selected for testing at border crossings between Aug. 9 and 26. Experts express concern that the open border policy was formulated in early July, when the delta variant wasn't as prevalent in Canada, and that fully vaccinated people can still be infected and transmit the virus. The full rate of breakthrough cases is still unknown, and experts emphasize the importance of focusing on the domestic situation and getting more vulnerable Canadians vaccinated. These points highlight the ongoing risk of COVID-19 transmission in Ontario, Canada, particularly among the unvaccinated, and the potential risks associated with allowing fully vaccinated foreign travelers to enter the country. The article also emphasizes the importance of monitoring the situation and adjusting policies as needed to mitigate the spread of the virus.
