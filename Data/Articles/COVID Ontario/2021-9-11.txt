The provided text appears to be a scientific brief on addressing the opioid crisis in Ontario, Canada, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Key Points: 
1. Opioid-related harm: Rates of fatal overdose and other opioid-related harms have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Less restrictive OAT (opioid agonist treatment) regulations
Increased access to harm reduction services, such as supervised consumption sites, in shelters and emergency settings
Addressing stigma in healthcare systems
Improving upstream social determinants of health (SDOH)
3. Disproportionately affected populations: Rural and Northern communities, people experiencing poverty or homelessness, those incarcerated, and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities have been disproportionately impacted by opioid-related harm.
4. Gaps in data capabilities: There are gaps in provincial data on opioid-related harms for specific subgroups, such as racialized or marginalized communities.
5. Collaboration and coordination: A coordinated effort among service providers, researchers, and government is necessary to address the overdose crisis, prioritizing harm reduction during a time of disruption.
Methods: 
The brief cites various sources, including:
1. Opioid-related mortality data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario

Title: Canada has opened up its borders to fully vaccinated foreign travellers. Are there risks?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here's a brief summary:
The province of Ontario is currently in the midst of a fourth wave of COVID-19.
Most cases and hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated population.
Low test positivity rate at border crossings (0.19% for fully vaccinated travellers between Aug 9-26).
Fully vaccinated foreign travellers will still pose some risk, but it's considered low due to testing and vaccination requirements.
The focus should be on eliminating domestic cases rather than worrying about imported variants.
