Here is a summary of the article: British Columbia health officials reported 820 new COVID-19 cases and nine deaths on Friday, the highest daily death toll since February. There are currently 5,850 active cases in the province, with 281 hospitalizations and 135 people in intensive care. Hospitalizations have increased by 295% in the last month, and ICU admissions by about 487%. The provincial death toll is 1,856, with a total of 173,158 confirmed cases. As of Friday, 85.5% of those 12 and older in BC have received their first vaccine dose, and 78% are fully vaccinated. The province is implementing a vaccine card system starting Monday, requiring proof of vaccination for non-essential services. Unvaccinated individuals accounted for the vast majority of recent cases and hospitalizations. Here are some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Hospitalizations typically lag behind new cases, so an increase in cases now may predict higher hospitalizations in the coming weeks. Unvaccinated individuals are significantly more likely to be hospitalized, with a 35-fold higher risk compared to those fully vaccinated. The number of active cases and hospitalizations varies across the province, with Interior Health and Fraser Health having the highest number of active cases. Outbreaks in long-term care facilities and other healthcare settings can significantly impact hospitalization rates. The provincial vaccination rate continues to increase gradually, which may help reduce the strain on hospitals in the coming months. Overall, the situation in British Columbia is evolving, and the impact of the vaccine card system and other public health measures will influence COVID-19 hospitalizations in the coming weeks and months.

Here is a summary of the article: Title: COVID-19 Wastewater Surveillance in Newfoundland and Labrador Objective: To provide an overview of COVID-19 wastewater surveillance efforts in Newfoundland and Labrador and its potential impact on forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Background: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be shed in the stool of infected individuals regardless of symptom presentation or diagnosis. Monitoring municipal wastewater for this virus offers a way to detect its presence in a large population, providing an early warning of potential outbreaks, including asymptomatic cases. Wastewater monitoring is a valuable tool for mass public health surveillance. Methodology: Wastewater samples are collected from treatment plants and shipped to laboratories for analysis. The virus RNA is then quantified using PCR analysis, and the results are reported as gene copies/mL to the relevant department. The data is made publicly available through a web mapping application, offering insights into sampling locations, sewersheds, and historical COVID-19 levels in wastewater. Results and Impact on Hospitalization Forecasting: The article provides a summary of sample dates, statuses, numbers analyzed, and testing frequencies. While specific data is not included, the mapping application allows for the tracking of COVID-19 prevalence over time and across different areas. This information can help public health officials identify emerging hotspots and potential outbreak locations, enabling them to allocate resources effectively and provide early warnings to the community. By detecting asymptomatic cases through wastewater surveillance, there is a higher chance of catching most COVID-19 cases, which can inform more accurate hospitalization forecasts and public health guidance. Resources: The article includes links to the COVID-19 Wastewater Mapping Application and relevant provincial COVID-19 resources, as well as contact information for the Community Water and Wastewater Section. Overall, this article highlights the value of wastewater surveillance as a tool for COVID-19 public health management and its potential to provide early warnings of outbreaks, helping to forecast and prepare for hospitalizations.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article presents insights from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, conducted by Statistics Canada in the third quarter of 2021, to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and their expectations for the future. Here's a summary: Impact of COVID-19 on Retail: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the retail sector in Canada, with many retailers deemed non-essential and forced to close temporarily or reduce their operating hours. This led to a record drop in retail sales in March 2020. Challenges and Uncertainties: Retail businesses faced several challenges and uncertainties due to the pandemic. About two-fifths of retailers expected maintaining inventory levels and rising input costs to be obstacles in the next three months. Additionally, they faced difficulties in recruiting skilled employees and labor shortages. Expected Increase in Selling Prices and Profitability: Despite the challenges, around 30% of retail businesses anticipated an increase in the selling prices of their goods and services in the short term, while about 21% of all businesses expected the same. Moreover, over one-fifth of retailers expected their profitability to improve, compared to 13.7% of all businesses. Optimistic Future Outlook: With the easing of public health restrictions, most businesses in the retail trade were optimistic or somewhat optimistic about their future outlook for the next 12 months. More than half of the retailers believed they could continue operating for at least 12 months before considering closure or bankruptcy. Ability to Take on More Debt: Three-fifths of retail businesses reported they could take on more debt if needed, compared to 55.3% of all businesses. However, cash flow and uncertainty in future sales were common challenges for those who couldn't take on additional debt. Government Support: Similar to all businesses, about 70% of retailers accessed COVID-19 related funding or credit to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic. The survey provides a snapshot of the retail sector's expectations and challenges during the third quarter of 2021, as the Canadian economy continued to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Publisher: McGill University Health Centre
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: In Canada, over 7 million people suffer from immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. As these conditions require immunosuppressive drugs, there are concerns about the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for this vulnerable group. Led by Dr. Sasha Bernatsky, a nationwide study is being conducted to assess vaccine effectiveness, safety, and hesitancy among 2,500 IMID patients. The research team, including experts from multiple universities, will collect and analyze blood samples to study antibody levels, post-vaccine reactions, and COVID infections in this population. The study aims to address knowledge gaps, alleviate safety concerns, and inform public health recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in vulnerable patient groups. The Vaccine Surveillance Reference Group (VSRG) and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF) are supporting this important research to protect Canadians with IMID from COVID-19 and ensure evidence-based decisions.

Title: PAHO Director urges countries to prioritize pregnant and lactating women for COVID-19 vaccinations
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 poses a severe risk to pregnant women in Latin America and the Caribbean, with more than 270,000 infections and 2,600 deaths among pregnant women in the region. In Mexico and Colombia, COVID-19 was the leading cause of maternal deaths in 2021, and Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil account for half of all COVID-19 deaths among pregnant women in the area. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommends prioritizing pregnant and lactating women for vaccination and ensuring their access to health services. PAHO also emphasizes the continued importance of public health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoiding indoor gatherings for pregnant women. The organization reports nearly 1.5 million cases and 22,000 deaths in the Americas in the last week, with varying trends across countries. Vaccination campaigns face supply challenges, with only 28% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean fully vaccinated. PAHO is working to increase vaccine access through various initiatives. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts could be useful: Pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are more likely to develop severe symptoms and require ventilation and intensive care. They also have a higher risk of pre-term delivery. Ensuring vaccine access and prioritizing pregnant women for vaccination can help reduce hospitalizations. Disruptions to maternal and newborn care due to the pandemic can impact pregnancy-related health outcomes and increase the risk of complications. The overall vaccination rate in the region is low, with limited supplies impacting the progress of vaccination campaigns. Therefore, to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is crucial to consider the vulnerability of pregnant women, the availability of vaccines, and the potential impact of disrupted healthcare services. Increasing vaccine access and prioritizing the vaccination of pregnant women can help mitigate the risk of severe COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in this high-risk group.

Title: WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 8 September 2021
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the inequitable distribution of vaccines and other life-saving tools, which is driving a two-track pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets to support countries in vaccinating their populations, but there has been limited progress in low-income countries due to vaccine hoarding by high-income countries and manufacturers prioritizing bilateral deals. The article also mentions a meningitis outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which WHO is supporting the response to. Key points include: More than 50,000 weekly COVID-19 deaths worldwide since October 2020, with recent weekly deaths nearing 70,000. 5.5 billion vaccine doses administered globally, but 80% in highand upper-middle-income countries. WHO targets to vaccinate 10% of every country's population by September 2021, 40% by 2021-end, and 70% by mid-2022. High-income countries' pledge to donate 1 billion doses has <15% fulfillment. The WHO calls for a moratorium on booster shots until the end of 2021 to prioritize first doses for high-risk people globally. The G20 countries are urged to show leadership in promoting vaccine equity and ending the pandemic. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article mentions that some countries with high vaccine coverage are seeing a decoupling of cases and deaths, indicating that hospitalizations and deaths may remain low even with increasing cases among unvaccinated individuals. However, premature relaxation of public health measures puts unvaccinated and immunocompromised individuals at extreme risk. Thus, forecasting hospitalizations would depend on factors such as vaccine coverage, the emergence of new variants, public health measures in place, and the capacity of healthcare systems to manage COVID-19 cases.
