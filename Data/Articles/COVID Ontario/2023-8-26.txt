Title: Excess mortality among older adults institutionalized in long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based analysis in Catalonia
Publisher: Frontiers
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
It appears that you've provided a list of references related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on older adults, particularly those living in care homes. Here's a brief summary:
The references discuss various aspects of the pandemic's effect on this population, including:
1. Excess mortality rates among care home residents during the first wave of the pandemic (Morciano et al., 2021)
2. Clinical and resource-use characteristics of institutionalized older people in Catalonia (Amblàs-Novellas et al., 2020)
3. The performance of quantitative measures of multimorbidity, which can predict health service utilization (Vela et al., 2021)
4. Multimorbidity as a predictor of health service utilization in primary care (Monterde et al., 2020)
5. Comparing the clinical characteristics and mortality of residential and non-residential older people with COVID-19 (Marin-Gomez et al., 2022)
Additionally, some references discuss the importance of considering frailty when assessing outcomes from COVID-19 (Miles et al., 2020) and the need for effective vaccination strategies to protect this vulnerable population (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, n.d.).

Title: Big data evidence of the impact of COVID-19 hospitalizations on mortality rates of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The text you provided appears to be a statistical analysis of patient-level microdata from the Brazilian public health system, specifically focusing on ICU patients and their outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here's a breakdown of what I've understood from your explanation:
1. Data Source: The data comes from the Brazilian Public Health System (SIH/SUS) records, which contain detailed information about patient diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.
2. Model Objectives:
- To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on ICU patient mortality rates in Brazil by accounting for various factors influencing these outcomes.
- Specifically, to identify whether and how spillover effects from the pandemic influence non-COVID-19 ICU patients' mortality.
3. Regression Model: The analysis employs a high-dimensional fixed-effects regression model (Equation 1), which includes:
- Four high-dimensional fixed effects: postal code (21,518 five-digit codes), hospital, epidemiological week, and disease diagnosis (1508 ICD-10 codes).
- Control variables for sex, age (with nonlinear effects allowed), total number of ICU patients in the same hospital and week.
- The model aims to capture spillover effects from COVID-19 while controlling for demand and supply factors.
4. Methodology:
- The feasible estimator for high-dimensional fixed effects is used to estimate the model, offering advantages over alternative approaches in terms of computational efficiency.
- Cluster-robust standard errors with hospital clustering are implemented for inference.
5. Key Findings: While specific results and interpretations (coefficients, p-values, etc.) aren't provided within your text, it suggests that the analysis aims to offer insights into how spillover effects from COVID-19 influence mortality rates among non-COVID-19 ICU patients in Brazil, considering a rich set of control variables.
