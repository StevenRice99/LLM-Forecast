Title: Here's what you need to know about the new COVID vaccines
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: Health Canada is reviewing submissions from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to update their COVID-19 vaccines to target the latest variants, with authorization dependent on multiple factors. This new vaccine will specifically target the XBB.1.5 Omicron variant and its sub-lineages, with Moderna claiming increased effectiveness against the BA.2.86 subvariant. The constantly mutating nature of the COVID-19 virus has rendered its original form extinct, necessitating updated vaccines. Unlike the flu or measles, COVID-19 requires more frequent vaccinations due to its multiple waves and variants. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends a dose of the new vaccine for authorized age groups at least six months after their last COVID-19 vaccine or infection. While the distribution timeline is uncertain, the federal government plans to launch an informational campaign to promote personal well-being and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. The new vaccine is also under review by authorities in the U.S. and Europe.

Title: Want a COVID-19 booster? Experts say most Canadians should wait for updated shots
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
As COVID-19 infection rates rise again in Canada, many people are wondering whether to get a booster shot now or wait for the updated vaccines expected to roll out by early October. Health officials, including Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, recommend that most people wait for the updated boosters, which will be more effective against the currently circulating Omicron subvariants. However, for individuals at higher risk of severe disease, an additional dose of the current vaccine may be beneficial if it has been over six months since their last vaccination or infection. The decision to get a COVID-19 booster is more nuanced now, and vulnerable populations, including immunocompromised individuals, pregnant people, older adults, and those with pre-existing health conditions, may require more frequent vaccinations. Health Canada is also reviewing updated boosters for children aged six months and up. To streamline the vaccination process and increase convenience, officials are planning to offer both influenza and COVID-19 booster shots simultaneously, as only around four in 10 Canadians received flu shots in the last three seasons. Medical experts hope that vaccination coverage will help manage hospital capacity, which is already stretched thin, during the upcoming respiratory virus season.

Title: Large number of COVID-19 reinfections in Northern Hemisphere ‘concerning’: WHO - National
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern over a surge in COVID-19 cases in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically sees a peak in respiratory illnesses during winter. The WHO has urged countries to strengthen their surveillance and reporting of COVID-19 cases as hospitalizations have spiked in the last month, especially in European nations. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on the COVID-19 response, warned that the virus is currently reinfecting millions of people each week, but the true extent is unknown due to reduced surveillance. She added that the uptick in cases in the Northern Hemisphere is concerning, especially with other challenges like wildfires and extreme heat. While the pandemic may seem less threatening than before, the WHO emphasized that the virus is still evolving and governments must remain vigilant. Canada is also tracking a new variant, BA.2.86, which has been classified as a "variant under monitoring" by the WHO due to its large number of mutations. As of August 18, there had been no detections of this variant in Canada, but the Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring it.

Title: Canada ‘likely at the start’ of new COVID-19 wave. How big will it get? - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Canada is likely experiencing the beginning of a new wave of COVID-19 infections, with an increase in cases and wastewater data indicating heightened viral activity. Health experts warn that while the severity of this wave is unknown, Canadians should stay vigilant as two new variants, EG.5 and BA.2.86, are being monitored. COVID-19 hospitalizations have risen in the past year, with an increase in patients requiring ICU admissions and ventilation. The upcoming fall and winter seasons, coupled with a return to indoor settings, may contribute to a further rise in cases. Canadians are advised to stay up-to-date with vaccinations and mask up in high-risk settings to curb the spread.

Title: Return to life after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic: A look at culture, arts, entertainment and recreation services in 2022
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: After a challenging two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses in the culture, arts, entertainment, and recreation sectors experienced a strong recovery in 2022, as restrictions eased and people sought out activities outside their homes. The study examines the financial recovery of these sectors using alternative datasets, including GST sales and payroll deduction files. Nationally, there was significant growth in revenue and salaries across most industries, except publishing, which continued to decline. The strongest revenue growth was in event promotion, while the largest salary increases were in the for-profit performing arts sector. Publishing industries faced challenges like rising paper costs and digital competition, with the largest revenue decline in newspaper publishing. The lifting of restrictions boosted revenues and salaries in spectator sports and related industries, as arenas and theatres operated at full capacity. Performing arts also thrived with the return of live shows, and the motion picture and video industries benefited from a backlog of projects. Amusement and recreation industries, including golf, skiing, and fitness centers, experienced varied growth due to the impact of pandemic restrictions. The article does not provide specific forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations, but the recovery of these sectors and the increase in social activities may have implications for hospitalizations if COVID-19 cases rise. The data reflects the financial recovery and resilience of these sectors, which were heavily impacted by the pandemic, and provides insight into consumer behavior and spending patterns as restrictions eased.

Title: Highly mutated COVID virus variant BA.2.86 showing up in multiple countries
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A new variant of COVID-19, BA.2.86, has emerged and is being monitored by health officials worldwide. While it has shown up in multiple countries, including Israel, Denmark, the US, and the UK, it is still unclear whether it will cause a significant fall wave of infections. This variant has more than 30 mutations in its spike protein, which could allow it to evade the immune system and cause more infections. However, scientists have cautioned that it may not be as transmissible as previous variants, and its impact is difficult to predict. Health officials in the UK and US are monitoring the variant, with a small number of cases identified so far. Denmark has also reported unlinked cases, and researchers are studying the variant to understand its severity and contagiousness. While the genetic information about BA.2.86 is available, its transmissibility and clinical impact are yet to be determined. This development comes as parts of the world, including Canada, are experiencing a rise in COVID-19 cases, with another Omicron subvariant, EG.5, becoming dominant in the US. However, the landscape of immunity has changed significantly due to vaccination and previous infections, which may lessen the impact of new variants.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 can cause lasting damage to cells’ energy production
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the findings of a research team led by Dr. Afshin Beheshti and Dr. Douglas Wallace, which suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause lasting damage to mitochondria, the energy-producing component of cells. This damage may contribute to the organ dysfunction seen in COVID-19 patients, as mitochondria are responsible for generating most of the energy needed by cells. The research team compared mitochondrial gene expression in tissue samples from COVID-19 patients and uninfected individuals, finding that genes involved in energy production were suppressed during acute infection, shifting cells into a state that favored viral replication. This suppression persisted in certain organs even after the virus had been cleared, indicating possible long-term damage. Animal models showed similar results, with mitochondrial energy production suppressed during early infection and recovering once the immune system controlled the virus. The findings highlight a potential novel treatment approach: by stopping the virus from hijacking mitochondrial energy production, serious complications may be prevented. Additionally, the researchers identified a regulatory molecule, miR-2392, as a potential therapeutic target, as neutralizing it could impede viral replication and improve outcomes for at-risk patients. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and offer potential avenues for developing more effective treatments to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and long-term organ damage.

Title: COVID-19 linked to diabetes risk, study shows
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
As COVID-19 activity rises again, researchers are emphasizing the importance of avoiding infection to prevent potential long-term health repercussions. A growing body of evidence suggests a link between COVID-19 and an increased risk of developing diabetes, a condition that impairs the body's ability to control blood sugar and can lead to serious complications. Studies by Dr. Alan Kwan and Dr. Naveed Janjua found a significant association between COVID-19 infection and a heightened risk of diabetes, with the risk persisting even after the emergence of the Omicron variant. The risk is estimated to be 17% to 22% higher among those who test positive for COVID-19, with slightly higher risks for men and those with severe illness. This could add pressure to healthcare systems already under strain. While the mechanisms behind the link are not yet fully understood, inflammation and chronic inflammation-related autoimmunity post-COVID infection are potential factors. Researchers also highlight the possibility that steroid medications used to treat hospitalized COVID patients may affect blood sugar handling. However, more research is needed to determine the persistence of diabetes post-COVID. It's important to note that having controlled blood sugar levels during a severe illness is common and may not indicate diabetes. Nonetheless, even mild COVID cases have been associated with developing diabetes later on. To manage this dual health crisis, clinicians are advised to monitor individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 for signs of diabetes, especially those with other risk factors like obesity. Staying up to date with vaccinations is also recommended to help protect against the risk of COVID-19 and its potential long-term effects.
