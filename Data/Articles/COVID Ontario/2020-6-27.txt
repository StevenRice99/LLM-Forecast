Title: Still Confused About Masks? Here’s the Science Behind How Face Masks Prevent Coronavirus
Publisher: UC San Francisco
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
As of July 11, the latest updates and guidelines regarding COVID-19 include the recommendation for the general public to wear cloth masks in most public spaces in states like California. This update is a reversal from earlier guidelines by the CDC and WHO, which has caused some confusion. However, health experts emphasize that masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, and increasing mask usage will have a positive impact. The change in CDC guidance is attributed to a better understanding of the disease's prevalence and the knowledge that both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is possible. Studies have shown that viral load peaks before symptoms begin, and speaking can expel virus-carrying droplets. Additionally, it is challenging to identify infected individuals as they may be asymptomatic. Evidence supporting the efficacy of masks includes laboratory studies that demonstrate the ability of various masks to block respiratory droplets. Real-world studies also provide strong evidence, with one study showing that mask mandates led to a slowdown in the daily COVID-19 growth rate. Another study found that countries with cultural norms or policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates. Experts agree that wearing a mask is primarily beneficial for individuals with COVID-19 to protect others, but it also provides some protection for the wearer. The type of mask is less important than comfort and consistency, with N95 respirators being reserved for medical situations. Any mask covering the nose and mouth will provide risk reduction rather than absolute prevention. San Francisco has specified that masks with valves do not comply with the city's face-covering order, as these valves allow unfiltered air and droplets to escape, which defeats the purpose of wearing a mask. Overall, wearing a mask is an essential part of warding off COVID-19, along with handwashing and social distancing.

Here is a summary of the article: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its direct and indirect effects, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has announced a COVID-19 May 2020 Rapid Research Funding opportunity, investing over $109 million in COVID-19 research. One of the recipients of this grant is Assistant Professor Dr. Shannon MacDonald from the University of Alberta Faculty of Nursing. Dr. MacDonald's research focuses on two main objectives. Firstly, she will assess the provision of routine vaccines (such as childhood vaccines and those for pregnant women and older adults) across Canada's provinces and territories. This includes understanding the public's perceptions and intentions regarding these vaccines during the pandemic and measuring the pandemic's impact on vaccine coverage levels in three provinces. The second part of her research concentrates on future COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. MacDonald and her team will conduct a national survey to gauge the public's and healthcare providers' sentiments about potential COVID-19 vaccines and their willingness to receive them. The outcomes of this research are expected to have a significant impact on Canada's public health system. It will help determine if extra strategies are required to deliver routine vaccines and prevent outbreaks of other diseases. Additionally, it will provide insights into how Canadians may react to COVID-19 vaccines and guide the development of strategies to encourage vaccine uptake. Dr. MacDonald's involvement in vaccine research stems from her clinical experiences in the Pediatric ICU and her global health work in Indonesia and Ghana, where she witnessed children lacking access to life-saving vaccines. She aims to contribute to health promotion and improve vaccine access and uptake. The success of receiving the CIHR grant is attributed to the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team, and Dr. MacDonald is enthusiastic about involving research trainees from the University of Alberta.

The University of Manitoba researchers received funding to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on various populations, including children, racialized persons, newcomers, and Indigenous communities, as well as to study the cellular aspects of the disease and potential treatments. The total funding amount is $7.5 million, provided by the Canadian government and provincial partners. One project, led by Lori Wilkinson, focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and well-being of Indigenous peoples, racialized persons, and immigrants in Canada, the US, and Mexico, considering the influence of socioeconomic inequalities. Meghan Azad's project aims to understand the direct effects of coronavirus infection and the indirect effects of the pandemic on children, as well as the varying severity of the disease and the true infection rate in the population. Kevin Coombs' team will use a novel tool called SOMAscan to study how COVID-19 and other coronaviruses affect genes and proteins in human lung cells, which are the primary target of the virus. Josée Lavoie, in partnership with the First Nations Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba, will develop a modeling platform to estimate the course of infection, the impact of public health measures, and the resources needed to respond to community pandemics in Indigenous contexts. Nathan Nickel's project, in collaboration with Indigenous organizations, will provide data on COVID-19 testing patterns in Manitoba, which can inform the public health response across Canada. Ryan Zarychanski is leading an international trial to investigate the use of anticoagulant medications, such as heparins, to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 by reducing inflammation and preventing blood clots. These projects aim to address urgent questions about COVID-19 and its impacts on different populations, as well as to develop effective tools and strategies to mitigate the pandemic and improve patient outcomes.

Title: Resetting capital spending in the wake of COVID-19
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted organizations' ability to execute capital projects, and companies are looking for ways to mitigate the financial effects. One of the fastest and most effective ways to do this is by deferring capital expenditures, and many companies have already announced cuts in their capital budgets. To navigate this crisis, CFOs and company leaders need to quickly reset their capital-project portfolios. The article proposes a four-step process for resetting capital portfolios: 1. Triage the capital portfolio: Assess where to reduce or defer spending while minimizing liabilities. Identify projects that may no longer be viable due to work restrictions, limited resources, or changing market conditions. 2. Assess each project and prioritize: Analyze each project to develop a fact base for decision-making. Consider spending to date, committed spending, stoppage costs, expected benefits, stakeholder impact, and risk trade-offs. Prioritize projects based on industry-specific criteria. 3. Optimize selected projects: Maximize the value of priority projects by refining their business case, scope, design, contracting, and construction execution. Look for opportunities to save on capital expenditure and select large, complex projects for upgrades. 4. Reset the portfolio: Use the insights from the first three steps to create a trade-off analysis and finalize portfolio decisions. Adjustments should not only address the immediate crisis but also adapt to changing conditions over time. A successful portfolio reset can reduce capital spending and improve long-term success. It requires a more nimble process for capital allocation, a strong fact base, investment in new types of capital, speedy decision-making, and collaboration with stakeholders and suppliers. Operators should focus on projects that are "shovel worthy" rather than just "shovel ready," and prioritize projects with the greatest impact on recovery. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not directly provide specific facts or data. However, it emphasizes the importance of having a robust fact base to make informed decisions and minimize risks. This could include analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalization rates, healthcare capacity, and other relevant factors to make informed predictions and plan accordingly.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the economic impact of COVID-19 in Canada, focusing on the first quarter of 2020 and the month of March when non-essential businesses shut down. Real gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 7.2% in March and contracted by 2.1% in the first quarter, the largest decline since 2009. Household spending fell by a record 2.3% as public health restrictions impacted the last two weeks of March. Export and import volumes decreased, with a significant drop in travel services, motor vehicles, and parts. Manufacturing sales declined by 30% in April, and retail sales fell by over one-quarter. Employment losses totaled three million in March and April, but there was a gain of 290,000 jobs in May as restrictions eased in some provinces. The unemployment rate rose to 13.7% in May, and many Canadians wanted to work but did not look for jobs. Lower-wage workers were severely affected, with employment losses of nearly 40%. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors could be important: The number of COVID-19 cases and the positivity rate in the community. The capacity of the healthcare system, including ICU beds and ventilators. The vaccination rate and the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants. The impact of public health measures such as physical distancing and mask mandates. The weather and seasonal factors that may influence transmission rates. By analyzing these factors and using data from similar periods or other jurisdictions, forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations can be made to help plan and allocate resources effectively.

Title: How COVID-19 has changed Canada's economy for the worse — but also for the better
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many facets of Canadian life, including the economy, housing, transportation, and work. Here are some key points from the article: Housing Market: Physical distancing measures and economic uncertainty led to a slowdown in the housing market, with home sales plummeting in April and May. While realtors expect the slowdown to be temporary, the Bank of Canada predicts an increase in mortgage delinquencies. Lower interest rates are encouraging new buyers and refinancing by existing homeowners. Commercial Real Estate: The pandemic may lead to a shift away from traditional downtown office spaces as people reconsider the benefits of living and working in dense urban areas. Transportation: Public transit use has declined significantly during the pandemic, while bike sales and the use of private vehicles have increased. This shift may impact the demand for transportation options in the future. Retail: Retail sales in Canada fell sharply in April, with a 25% decrease, as consumers focused on essential purchases. Online shopping, however, has seen a boom, with a more than 100% increase in online sales in April. Retailers are accelerating their shift to online selling, and companies like Shopify, which enables real-world stores to sell online, have thrived during the pandemic. Work: The pandemic has accelerated the trend toward flexible work arrangements, with companies like Shopify offering permanent work-from-home options. This shift toward flexibility is expected to benefit both employees and companies in the long term. Overall, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the Canadian economy, but there are also opportunities for positive changes, such as a more flexible and digitally focused approach to work and a boom in online retail. The resilience of the technology sector is particularly encouraging as Canada's economy adapts to the post-pandemic reality.

Title: Blame, bullying and disrespect: Chinese Canadians reveal their experiences with racism during COVID-19 -
Publisher: Angus Reid Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the results of a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute in partnership with the University of Alberta, which focused on the experiences and sentiments of Canadians of Chinese ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the survey, half of the respondents reported being called names or insulted due to their ethnicity, and 43% said they had been threatened or intimidated. Additionally, 30% encountered racist graffiti or messages on social media, and 29% felt they were seen as a threat to the health and safety of others. As a result, 61% altered their routines to avoid unpleasant encounters, and 50% did so frequently. A majority felt that Canadians blamed people of Chinese ethnicity for COVID-19, and only 13% believed they were always viewed as fully Canadian. Two-thirds expected that Asian children would face bullying when returning to school. The survey also explored the respondents' sense of identity and belonging in Canada, with many feeling proud of their Canadian and Chinese identities but not fully accepted by other Canadians. The article concludes by highlighting the longitudinal nature of the research and the need for further analysis, including interviews in Mandarin. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following facts from the article could be relevant: The survey suggests a high level of anxiety and change in behavior among Canadians of Chinese ethnicity due to discrimination and abuse, which could impact their mental health and access to healthcare services. The perception of blame and negative media coverage directed at people of Chinese ethnicity may influence their willingness to seek medical help or adhere to public health measures related to COVID-19. The expectation of bullying and discrimination in schools could impact the mental health and well-being of Chinese Canadian children and their families, potentially leading to delayed healthcare seeking or increased stress, which are risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. It is important to consider these social and behavioral factors in addition to epidemiological data when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as they can influence the spread and severity of the disease within specific communities.

Title: Global Value Chains and the Post-COVID-19 Economy
Publisher: Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of the current model of global production, which is heavily dependent on open trade and suppliers from various parts of the world. Disruptions in the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for 50% of global value chain (GVC) production lines and 78% of GVC-related advanced information and communication technologies, have been significant. The pandemic has accelerated the need for adjustments in GVCs and supply chains, which are essential for optimizing output and creating competitive advantages for firms. The extent of the disruption is unclear, but it is widespread and affecting various sectors. Companies and countries are reassessing their production networks, with the Asia Pacific region taking the lead in restarting international economic exchange. The pandemic has also impacted the trend of "reshoring," or the redirection of manufacturing back to a company's home country, with Southeast Asian countries and Mexico benefiting more than the United States. To stabilize production networks and trade, the World Economic Forum emphasizes the need for common standards and global governance. The urgent policy recommendation is to establish a 'global essential worker' designation to prioritize the health and ease the burden of trade-related workers, especially sea laborers, who are vital for transporting traded goods. In the medium term, the shift towards digital supply networks is crucial, with companies adopting technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to anticipate disruptions and identify alternative production sites. Canada's role in this context involves engaging in international negotiations for fair competition and quality control in GVCs, as well as assisting Canadian industries, particularly micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), in adapting to the new environment through digital technologies.

Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the important role of spiritual care workers, also known as chaplains, in providing emotional and spiritual support to patients, families, and hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Julian Menezes, a spiritual care worker at the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Montreal, shares his experiences working in the "hot" zone, where COVID-19 patients are treated. Some key points from the article include: Physical barriers, masks, and social distancing measures in hospitals to limit viral exposure have emotional costs, especially for patients who cannot receive visitors and fear dying alone. Spiritual care workers provide support to patients in hot zones while wearing protective equipment, navigating the challenges of obscured faces and interrupted touch. In the early days of the pandemic, hospital staff at the RVH were concerned about transmitting the virus to their families, but as the pandemic continued, they faced additional challenges, including feeling powerless to help patients and providing care from behind protective gear. Spiritual care workers also support hospital staff, helping them acknowledge and accept the emotional toll of their work, especially as they witness intimate moments of patients' deaths. As hospitalizations decrease, the article reflects on the exposure of hospital staff to profound questions about life, death, and the nature of intimacy and grief during the pandemic. Overall, the article highlights the crucial role of spiritual care workers in supporting patients, families, and staff during the COVID-19 crisis and their contribution to navigating the emotional and spiritual challenges brought on by the pandemic.
