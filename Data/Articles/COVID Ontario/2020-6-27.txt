Title: 'Perverse logic': Don't compare the flu to COVID-19
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Key points:
The case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 in Canada was estimated to be at least 1.6% near the end of April, which is higher than the CFR for seasonal flu (typically <0.1%).
The number of hospitalizations from COVID-19 was expected to be much higher than those from seasonal flu (already over 10,000 as of June 24 vs. approximately 12,200 per year for flu).
The incubation period and basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 are longer and potentially higher than those for seasonal flu, indicating a greater potential for spread.
Lockdown efforts have likely slowed the COVID-19 infection rate dramatically, saving lives and making direct comparisons to seasonal flu misleading.

Title: How Canada could avoid a 2nd wave of COVID-19
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Daily case numbers and hospitalizations are falling (FALSE).
A second wave of COVID-19 may not occur, but smaller waves or no wave at all could happen.
The likelihood of a second wave depends on Canadians keeping their guard up and quickly identifying and controlling new outbreaks.
Factors that increase the risk of another wave include:
+ Most Canadians are susceptible to COVID-19 due to lack of immunity.
+ Large indoor gatherings (e.g., churches, nightclubs) can lead to super-spreading events.
Understanding of the virus has increased, allowing for better control measures:
+ Physical distancing and mask-wearing are effective tools in preventing infection.
+ Early identification, contact tracing, and isolation can prevent outbreaks from snowballing into larger epidemics.

Title: COVID-19 increases risk for Canada's 'invisible' homeless women: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article mentions that statistics from 2019 show emergency shelters were already turning away nearly 1,000 women and children per day before the pandemic.
The pandemic caused a strain on existing homelessness resources, with some shelters having to reduce services or close due to public health and physical distancing rules.
It is expected that more women may become homeless as eviction moratoriums begin to lift, which could lead to increased COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.

Title: Millions of dollars in COVID-19 fines disproportionately hurting Black, Indigenous, marginalized groups: report
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Fines for COVID-related violations are issued disproportionately to marginalized groups (Black, Indigenous, people of colour). Most fines were given over physical distancing and gathering requirements. The majority of fines were issued in Quebec ($10.08 million), with Ontario issuing $2.42 million.

Title: Nobody died in these nursing homes - what did they do right?
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article highlights the different experiences of long-term care facilities in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some facilities, such as Yee Hong and Shepherd Village, took proactive measures to prepare for the pandemic by providing extensive training and education on infection control, implementing regular communication with staff, residents, and family members, and encouraging self-quarantine.
These homes reported relatively few cases of COVID-19 among residents and staff, and were able to maintain a sense of trust and cooperation among their teams. In contrast, other facilities struggled with outbreaks, staffing shortages, inadequate training, and poor communication.
The article also mentions the Canadian Armed Forces report, which highlighted serious concerns about PPE shortages, staffing shortages, inadequate training and communication, and severely deficient isolation measures at some long-term care facilities. This report detailed disturbing scenes of residents "crying out for help" and being ignored for hours, as well as staff being fearful to use supplies due to costs.
The article suggests that the proactive approach taken by Yee Hong and Shepherd Village may have been due in part to their non-profit status and ability to reallocate capital reserves to support pandemic preparedness. The CEOs of these facilities emphasize the importance of proper training, communication, and trust-building among staff, residents, and family members.
