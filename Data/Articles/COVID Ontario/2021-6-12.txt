Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing and residential care facilities in Canada, with a focus on infection prevention, staffing challenges, and outbreak rates. The data is derived from the 2020 Nursing and Residential Care Facility Survey, with a response rate of 66%. Nearly all facilities implemented new or enhanced infection prevention measures, such as regular hand washing, environmental cleaning, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, despite these measures, many facilities faced significant challenges, particularly in staffing. About 86% of facilities experienced at least one staffing-related issue, with nursing homes being the most affected. In terms of outbreak rates, Ontario, Quebec, and the Prairies had the highest percentage of facilities reporting a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Outbreaks were more prevalent in nursing homes and seniors' homes compared to other types of facilities. Logistic regression analysis revealed that larger facilities, cases among employees, and staffing shortages were associated with outbreaks in nursing homes, while shared rooms, large facilities, and cases among employees were risk factors for outbreaks in seniors' homes. The article concludes by highlighting the need for further research to better understand the pandemic's impact on these facilities and to develop strategies to mitigate future risks. The data and insights provided offer valuable insights into the challenges faced by Canada's residential care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: A link between Covid-19 vaccination and a cardiac illness may be getting clearer
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
CNN reports that there has been a higher-than-expected number of cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, among young people who have recently received their second doses of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC states that the reports of myocarditis are rare and most patients recover quickly with medicine and rest. The Israeli Ministry of Health also found a potential link between the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and myocarditis in males aged 16-30. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reported that within 30 days of receiving the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, there was a higher number of myocarditis and pericarditis cases in 16-24-year-olds than expected. Myocarditis cases have also been documented in Israel, the US military, and Spain. Medical groups emphasize that the risk of complications from COVID-19 outweighs the small risk of developing myocarditis after vaccination. The potential link between the vaccine and myocarditis has caused concern that parents will be hesitant to vaccinate their children, which could hinder the Biden administration's efforts to encourage young people to get vaccinated. CDC data shows a decline in COVID-19 vaccinations for adolescents 12-15 years old after news of the myocarditis reports broke on May 22. Experts suggest that regular statements from CDC officials to parents about the possible myocarditis risk and the benefits of vaccination could help increase public confidence.

Here is a summary of the article, along with important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in Windsor, Ontario: Summary: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Windsor-Essex, Ontario, has experienced three lockdowns/shutdowns and various stages of reopening. The provincial government introduced a color-coded framework in November 2020, which was replaced by a three-step reopening plan in May 2021. The region has transitioned through different stages and colors, with restrictions and reopenings of businesses, schools, and recreational activities. The article provides a timeline of these changes, highlighting key dates and the impact on the community. The latest update as of January 3, 2022, is the implementation of "modified Step 2" restrictions, including capacity limits and closures of indoor dining, gyms, and schools. Important Facts for Hospitalization Forecast: Timeline: Understanding the progression of the pandemic in Windsor-Essex provides context for forecasting hospitalizations. The region experienced waves of infections, with corresponding changes in restrictions. Reopening Stages and Colors: The impact of reopening stages and color-coded zones on mobility and social distancing can influence hospitalization forecasts. Relaxed restrictions may lead to increased social interactions and potential virus transmission. School Closures: School closures can affect the spread of the virus among younger age groups and their close contacts. This, in turn, may impact hospitalization rates. Capacity Limits: Reduced capacity limits in venues and closures of certain businesses can help curb the spread of the virus and potentially reduce hospitalizations. Previous Waves: Analyzing hospitalization data from previous waves can provide insights into the healthcare system's capacity and the impact of restrictions on flattening the curve. Vaccination Rates: While not mentioned in the provided article, vaccination rates among eligible age groups are crucial for forecasting hospitalizations. Higher vaccination rates generally lead to lower hospitalization rates. Omicron Variant: The highly transmissible Omicron variant is driving a rapid increase in cases across Ontario. This will likely result in a surge in hospitalizations, with the peak depending on the effectiveness of the new restrictions. By considering these factors, public health officials and healthcare providers can forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and prepare accordingly to ensure sufficient resources and capacity to manage the impact on the healthcare system.

Publisher: Ville de Westmount
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
As of June 8th, the Gouvernement du Québec has announced a downgrade in COVID-19 alert levels for all regions of Quebec, with the Montréal region moving to yellow (pre-alert) status from orange as of June 14th. This relaxation in restrictions includes allowing outdoor graduation events for high school students from July 8th and the opening of bar terraces from June 11th, with varying restrictions based on zone color. Supervised outdoor sports and recreation activities will also be permitted for up to 25 people from June 11th. Looking ahead, as of June 25th, fully vaccinated individuals will be permitted to gather in private residences, and day/summer camps will reopen. Festivals and other outdoor activities with up to 2,500 people will also be allowed to resume. From late August, fully vaccinated individuals will no longer need to wear face coverings at public places or events. These measures indicate a gradual reopening of Quebec, with a focus on outdoor activities and gatherings for vaccinated individuals. The relaxation of restrictions for graduation events and the reopening of bars and sports activities suggest a positive forecast for COVID-19 hospitalizations, indicating that the government believes the healthcare system can handle a potential increase in cases. However, the continued emphasis on face coverings for unvaccinated individuals and the phased approach to reopening suggest a cautious approach to managing COVID-19.

Title: New ICAO VDS delivers important benefits for secure and efficient COVID-19 testing and vaccination validation
Publisher: ICAO
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has announced the development of a Visible Digital Seal (VDS) to facilitate the secure verification of COVID-19 test and vaccination certificates for air travel. The VDS is a two-dimensional barcode that can be presented on paper or digitally and will enable border control to efficiently verify an individual's health status against established requirements. This innovation aims to support the international community in safely reopening borders and resuming air travel while minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring interoperability across different countries. The specification for the VDS was approved by ICAO's Council Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) in March 2021, and it is expected to be implemented quickly and cost-effectively due to its reliance on existing infrastructure and procedures. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, while this article does not provide direct data for that purpose, the VDS system is designed to aid in the safe resumption of air travel by verifying individuals' health statuses, which could indirectly impact hospitalization rates by helping to prevent the cross-border spread of COVID-19.

Title: The difficulty of vaccinating the world against COVID-19 is enormous
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
As of the article's writing, about 88% of the world's population has not received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. This inequality is a threat to global health and could lead to the emergence of new variants. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially hoped to have 20% of the global population inoculated by the end of 2021, but this goal is looking increasingly unlikely. Achal Prabhala, who studies access to medicines, notes that the pandemic's course changed at the end of May when death rates in lower-income countries exceeded those in wealthier nations for the first time. The poorest countries with the weakest infrastructure are now seeing the most deaths and illnesses. Rohinton Medhora, president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in ending the pandemic. He estimates that global herd immunity may not be achieved until 2023-24 based on current vaccination rates. COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a global initiative backed by the WHO and other health groups, has fallen short of its pledge to deliver doses to countries in need. COVAX and the WHO are now calling on countries to donate excess doses. Part of the reason for the vaccine shortfall is the complicated business of manufacturing and distributing vaccines. Intellectual property laws protect vaccines, and only licensed facilities are permitted to produce them. Some countries are calling for a waiver of these laws to allow more manufacturers to produce and distribute vaccines without licenses. However, a majority of World Trade Organization (WTO) countries, including Canada and Germany, have not supported this idea. The inequality of vaccine distribution is causing economic problems and fueling unrest in some countries. For example, in Venezuela, where only 11% of the population has received one shot, people are protesting and demanding more vaccines. Nigeria, which has relied on COVAX and the African Union for its doses, has vaccinated less than 1% of its population. The pandemic is having a significant economic impact on the country, with exports reduced and unemployment risen to 33%. Experts warn that a nationalist approach to the pandemic will prolong it, as the virus will continue to mutate and spread globally. Edwin Ikhuoria, Africa Executive Director at the ONE Campaign, argues that helping other countries with their vaccine rollouts is not just a moral but also an economic imperative. He hopes that the sentiment of global solidarity that began the pandemic can help end it.

Publisher: Simon Fraser University News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
SFU is starting a COVID-19 rapid screening pilot project on its Burnaby campus as a preventive measure to protect the health and safety of its students. The project will offer rapid screening to students living in on-campus residences and varsity athletes from selected sports teams. The aim is to detect possible COVID-19 cases early and prevent the spread within the SFU community. This is particularly important as individuals can be asymptomatic but still spread the virus to others. By identifying cases early on through rapid screening, the university can help forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations and keep its community safe.

Title: The Logistics Impact of COVID-19 on Small Businesses
Publisher: Canadian Federation of Independent Business
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Small businesses have faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including logistics and supply chain disruptions. According to the article, 94% of companies across Europe and the United States experienced supply chain issues in 2020. In March 2021, 44% of small businesses in the U.S. reported temporary shortages and supply chain problems. Similarly, 93% of Canadian businesses expressed concerns about their supply chains in September 2020. The article also references data from Statistics Canada, indicating that 25% of private sector companies in Canada anticipated supply chain challenges in the first quarter of 2021. These logistics difficulties have had a significant impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the CFIB has conducted a study to understand the extent of the disruptions and their consequences for Canadian SMEs. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, several factors need to be considered, including vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, and the effectiveness of public health measures. The impact of supply chain disruptions on the healthcare system's ability to manage the pandemic should also be taken into account, as it can affect the availability of critical resources and equipment.

Title: U of T to require COVID-19 vaccinations for students living in residence
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The University of Toronto will require students living in residence during the 2021-2022 academic year to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with the support of local public health authorities. Students are requested to receive their first dose prior to moving in, preferably 14 days beforehand. Those who are unable to get vaccinated before the move-in date will have a two-week grace period to receive their first dose, and the university will assist in facilitating vaccine access. This measure is essential to protect the health and safety of residence students who live in close quarters. Students who do not receive their first dose within two weeks of moving in may face additional public health restrictions. Exemptions are available for medical or other grounds recognized by the Ontario Human Rights Code. The university will also adhere to existing health and safety protocols, such as mask-wearing and capacity limits, depending on public health guidance. U of T encourages all community members to get vaccinated as soon as possible and will facilitate vaccine access for those in need. These measures are expected to contribute to a gradual and safe return to in-person activities on campuses in the fall, while helping to reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations among the student population.

Title: Most labs in Canada not fully able to detect Delta COVID-19 variant, experts warn
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Canada may not be doing enough to track the spread of COVID-19 variants, particularly the Delta B.1.617 variant first discovered in India, according to several experts. Many public health labs use conventional PCR tests that can only detect one or two specific mutations, which is insufficient for identifying variants with multiple mutations like Delta. As a result, public health units in Ontario and other provinces are struggling to pinpoint the exact variants spreading in their regions. Using a new sequencing method, researchers found that the Delta variant accounted for about 20% of new positive cases in their data, suggesting that the actual number could be higher. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, acknowledged that Canada is doing more sequencing than many other countries, and provinces aim to sequence the majority of positive cases. She also emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated, citing a UK study that showed two doses are much more effective against the Delta variant. The Delta variant lacks the N501Y mutation found in other variants of concern, making it harder to detect with rapid PCR tests. However, one infectious disease expert, Dr. Gerald A. Evans, noted that Canada's low case numbers mean the true spread of the Delta variant is likely quite small. He believes that Canada is in a different phase of the pandemic due to increased vaccinations and stringent public health measures.
