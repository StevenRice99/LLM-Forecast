Title: Islamophobia is on the rise during COVID-19
Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated societal issues and led to a rise in Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment in Canada. Incidents of Islamophobia have occurred in the media, online, and in physical attacks. Some far-right individuals have targeted and blamed Muslims for the spread of COVID-19. There have been instances of fake news spreading on social media, claiming that Muslims are superspreaders of the virus or that they are receiving preferential treatment. This has resulted in an increase in harassment and violence against Canadian Muslims. Several mosques have been vandalized, and there has been a rise in violent crimes against Muslims, including physical assaults and racist confrontations. The caretaker of an Etobicoke mosque was stabbed to death, with the suspect linked to neo-Nazi groups. These incidents have caused fear and exclusion among Canadian Muslims, and have been detrimental to Muslim efforts in helping during the pandemic. Community and faith groups are advocating for improved human rights legislation and better tracking by law enforcement to address online hate and protect Muslim institutions. They are also calling for the government to fulfill its promises to combat online hate speech and misinformation. The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) has recommended reviewing existing legislation, regulating social media companies, and increasing funding for digital literacy programs.

Title: Descriptive epidemiology of deceased cases of COVID-19 reported during the initial wave of the epidemic in Canada, January 15 to July 9, 2020, CCDR 46(10)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
This article describes deaths from COVID-19 in Canada during the initial wave of the epidemic, from January 15 to July 9, 2020. As of July 9, 2020, Canada had reported 106,804 cases of COVID-19, with 8,749 deaths, resulting in a mortality rate of 23.3 per 100,000 population and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 8.2%. The CFR ranged from 0% to 10.0% across provinces and territories, with the differences likely due to variations in the extent of the epidemic and the occurrence of localized outbreaks in long-term care homes, affecting older individuals with multiple health conditions. The CFR increased with age and the number of pre-existing medical conditions, with the highest CFR of 34.4% among those aged 80 and above. Residents of long-term care and seniors' homes had a higher CFR of 26.8%. Overall, females had a higher rate of deaths per 100,000 population, but males had a higher CFR. The impact of COVID-19 on long-term care and seniors' homes has been severe, with Ontario and Quebec reporting over 70% of deaths occurring in these settings. Plans are underway to collect more detailed information on cases, including race and ethnicity, to better understand the communities most affected by COVID-19. Studies of excess mortality will also help clarify the full impact of COVID-19 in Canada. Public health authorities will continue to monitor deaths closely to inform measures to prevent fatal outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations.

Title: COVID-19 has hardened Canadian views on immigration
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigration to Canada and how it may affect Canadians' attitudes towards immigration in the future. The pandemic has closed borders and halted immigration, and there are concerns that even when borders reopen, immigrants may not be as welcomed as before due to changing Canadian attitudes. A survey by McMaster University and Dynata Research found that while most Canadians felt that immigration has made Canada a better place and has a positive impact on the economy and society, there are also signs of strain and discomfort. Over half of respondents felt that immigrants were not adopting Canadian values, and 46% saw them as a risk to the social welfare system. Additionally, 20% of Canadians admitted to having developed a more negative attitude towards immigration since the pandemic began, and most respondents were against increasing immigration levels post-pandemic. Only 22% felt that immigration would be important for Canada's economic recovery. The survey suggests that Canadians may be less keen on immigration and more inclined to protect the economy and their health by limiting border access. However, the article emphasizes that Canada still needs immigrants to rebuild the economy, fill jobs, and broaden the tax base, and it is imperative to remain open to immigration to ensure a strong post-pandemic future. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors, including vaccination rates, the severity of the virus strain, and adherence to public health measures, will be crucial. Border restrictions and limited immigration could also impact hospitalization rates, as a decrease in international travelers may result in fewer infections. However, the focus should be on increasing vaccination coverage and following safety protocols to mitigate the strain on the healthcare system effectively.

The Canadian Red Cross has contributed by raising over $814,000 for the Italy COVID-19 Response Appeal, which will help strengthen Italy's ability to carry out high-biocontainment emergency transports. The Italian Red Cross will continue to provide medical transportation for COVID-19 patients to hospitals, utilizing the new ambulances and equipment. These ambulances are equipped with specialized stretchers and medical equipment to protect medical workers and provide better care. The response and preparation for future health emergencies will be improved with the help of these donations and efforts. Key facts to consider for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The Italian Red Cross has already conducted over 10,000 emergency transports, indicating a high demand for medical transportation. There is a focus on providing support to vulnerable individuals, who are at higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization. The procurement of additional ambulances and specialized equipment suggests a potential increase in hospitalization capacity. The training of staff and volunteers on PPE usage indicates a continued focus on infection control and prevention, which may help reduce hospitalizations among medical workers. The collaboration between the Canadian and Italian Red Cross, along with the medical community, suggests a coordinated response that could impact hospitalization rates. Overall, the efforts of the Italian Red Cross and the support from the Canadian Red Cross are likely to have a positive impact on COVID-19 hospitalization management and preparedness for future waves or outbreaks.

Title: The major genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neanderthals
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the genetic basis of COVID-19 severity and identifies a specific genetic variant that increases the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. This variant is located on chromosome 3 and is inherited from Neanderthals, an extinct hominin species that contributed genetic material to modern humans through interbreeding tens of thousands of years ago. The variant is found at high frequencies in certain populations, particularly in South Asia, where it is carried by 50% of individuals. The presence of this variant may help explain the varying severity of COVID-19 symptoms and the higher risk of hospitalization in some individuals. The article also mentions another genetic factor associated with COVID-19 severity, which is the ABO blood group region on chromosome 9. Overall, the identification of these genetic risk factors can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and provide insights into the disease's variable clinical manifestations.

Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses research conducted by graduate students from the University of Toronto, who investigated the relationship between dreams and waking life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers collected data from 84 students from 22 countries, focusing on the content and themes of their dreams during the early lockdown phase. The analysis revealed that anxiety, fear, and confusion were the most commonly reported emotions in dreams, with respondents also reporting more vivid dreams and an increase in nightmares. Interestingly, about a third of the students had dreams specifically related to COVID-19, such as personal protective equipment and social distancing. The researchers interpreted these findings as evidence that dreams may reflect and help process external stressors. Additionally, the study explored the influence of culture on dream content and interpretation, with nearly a quarter of respondents reporting that their cultural background shaped their dream interpretations. The researchers suggested that dreams may prime individuals for next-day behavior and could have played a role in our ancestors' survival and reproduction. Overall, the study provides insights into the relationship between dreams and waking life during a global crisis and highlights the potential function of dreams in processing and preparing for real-life threats.

Title: Elon Musk doubles down on Covid-19 skepticism and says he won’t take future vaccine
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has once more made controversial statements regarding the severity of COVID-19 and his stance on vaccination. In an interview, Musk stated that he would not take a COVID-19 vaccine when available and evaded questions about compensating employees who choose to stay home to avoid infection. Musk, who has a history of controversial opinions, argued against widespread stay-at-home orders, suggesting that only at-risk individuals should be quarantined. He dismissed concerns about COVID-19-related deaths, stating that "everybody dies." Musk, the third-richest person globally, previously criticized lockdown measures as "de facto house arrest." During the interview, he also took aim at Bill Gates, who had suggested that Musk should stick to areas of his expertise. Musk responded by claiming that his company makes vaccine machines for CureVac, a company Gates has invested in. This exchange adds to previous criticisms Musk has made of Gates's opinions on electric vehicles.

Title: How COVID-19 worsens Canada's digital divide
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urban-rural divide in Canada when it comes to internet access, with many rural and First Nation communities lacking access to reliable, high-speed internet. The Chawathil First Nation in British Columbia, for example, has a dial-up connection with a slow download speed of just one megabit per second (Mbps), making it difficult for students to attend online classes and for the band to hold video meetings. The CRTC recommends a download speed of at least 50 Mbps for all households, but only about 40% of rural areas and 30% of First Nation communities have access to these speeds. The high cost of upgrading internet infrastructure in remote areas is often a barrier, with the Chawathil First Nation being quoted tens of thousands of dollars to increase their speed. Limited internet access has also made it more difficult for residents in remote areas to access healthcare during the pandemic, as many services have moved online. The Canadian government has allocated funding to support high-speed internet in rural and remote areas, but the application process for this funding has been slow. Organizations like the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) are working to advocate for better internet service and support community projects, but experts believe it will cost billions of dollars to bring broadband to all of Canada. In the meantime, residents in rural and remote areas, such as the hamlet of Ryder Lake, continue to struggle with slow and unreliable internet connections, which has made life during the pandemic even more challenging.
