Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the following values important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: 1. Ontario public health officials are projecting up to 1,000 new cases per day this month. 2. The number of patients in Ontario's hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 doubled in just one week. 3. Testing backlogs in Ontario reached a record high of more than 90,000 this week. 4. The number of contacts per COVID-19 case is "much higher" than in the first wave, according to Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health. 5. Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network in Toronto, warns that the rising case numbers across Canada are lagging indicators that will likely lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths. 6. Older Canadians may be next to feel the brunt of the pandemic, with potentially thousands of deaths. These values suggest that Ontario is experiencing a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, which may lead to increased hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among older Canadians. This information is crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario and informing public health decisions to mitigate the spread of the virus.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Ontario reported 653 new cases of COVID-19, down from the previous day's record high of 732. Quebec reported 1,107 new cases, the largest daily increase since the pandemic began. The country's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, warned that Canada is running out of time to prevent a major resurgence of COVID-19. Ontario has a backlog of over 91,000 tests considered "under investigation". Public health officials in Toronto are shifting their focus to only high-risk scenarios due to the increasing case count. New restrictions have been imposed in Ottawa, Toronto, and Peel Region, including restrictions on restaurants, bars, banquet halls, and gyms. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Daily case counts in Ontario and Quebec Backlog of tests considered "under investigation" in Ontario Increasing case count in Toronto and other hot spots New restrictions imposed in Ottawa, Toronto, and Peel Region Warning from Dr. Theresa Tam about the potential for a major resurgence of COVID-19.

Title: Researcher urges Canada to track link between race and COVID-19 as study reveals troubling trend
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study highlights the increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 among Black, South Asian, and Indigenous Canadians due to a higher likelihood of multiple pre-existing medical conditions. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: Indigenous Canadians are nearly twice as likely as white Canadians to have three or more pre-existing conditions. Foreign-born Black Canadians are 1.79 times as likely to have three or more pre-existing conditions. Foreign-born South Asians are 1.49 times as likely to have three or more pre-existing conditions. Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are the most common conditions. Low-income individuals and those without a post-secondary education are more likely to have three or more pre-existing conditions, with a likelihood of nearly four times that of white Canadians. These findings suggest that racialized groups in Ontario, Canada, may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19, which could impact hospitalization rates. By considering these factors, forecasters can better understand the potential risks and develop more accurate predictions of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the province.

Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the rising COVID-19 case numbers in Ontario and the debate among health professionals about whether to impose a new lockdown. The letter signed by 21 Ontario doctors argues that another province-wide lockdown would not be helpful and instead suggests a tactical localized approach to deal with the increasing case numbers. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada mentioned in the article include: Daily new cases: 700 new cases of COVID-19 were recorded on Monday, the highest number of new cases recorded in a single day. Positive percentage rate: 1.7% of tests were positive on Monday, compared to 5.2% on April 24. Hospitalizations: 128 people were in hospital with COVID-19 complications on Monday, up from 65 a week before, but still lower than the peak in May. ICU admissions: Not mentioned in the article, but the letter from the Ontario Hospital Association mentions a rise in ICU admissions in regions where the speed of transmission was underestimated. Overall, the article suggests that while case numbers are increasing, hospitalizations and ICU admissions are not yet at unmanageable levels, and a targeted approach may be more effective than a province-wide lockdown.

Title: Ontario's 2nd wave of COVID-19 forecast to peak in October
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The COVID-19 Modelling Collaborative predicts that Ontario's second wave will peak in midto late October, with the potential to exceed 1,000 new cases per day. The average number of new cases reported daily in Ontario is currently running four times higher than what it was at the end of August. The researchers forecast that if the second wave follows the patterns seen in Ontario in the spring, Michigan this summer, or the Australian state of Victoria, the number of COVID-19 patients in hospital will increase, but not beyond the capacity of the hospitals. However, if the second wave is as severe as the first wave that hit Italy, COVID-19 patients could fill Ontario's hospital wards and ICUs beyond their capacity. The researchers stress that the demographics of who gets infected in the coming weeks will impact the number of hospitalizations. The number of people aged 70 or older with an active confirmed case of COVID-19 has increased 34% in the space of a week. Ontario has around 2,000 intensive care beds, and the province plans to add 139 in October. The researchers calculate that Ontario has around 475 beds available for non-emergency surgery patients and COVID patients. If more than 100 people with COVID-19 need ICU care, they would be competing for space with scheduled surgery cases. The projections suggest that if Ontario's second wave follows what happened in the Australian state of Victoria, some 350 to 400 people will need an ICU bed at peak demand in late October. If the second wave in this province plays out as Michigan's did, the forecast is for more than 200 patients with COVID-19 in the ICUs from late October onwards. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the potential number of cases, hospitalizations, and ICU demand, as well as the demographics of who is getting infected and the capacity of the healthcare system.
