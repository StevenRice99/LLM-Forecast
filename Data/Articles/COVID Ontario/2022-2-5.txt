Title: COVID-19 in British Columbia by the numbers
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Overview of COVID-19 in British Columbia (B.C.): The COVID-19 outbreak in B.C. has been ongoing since the first case was announced on January 28, 2020, and has unfolded in multiple waves. Vaccines used in B.C. include Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca-Oxford, with Pfizer and Moderna used in the third dose stage. B.C. announced an age-based vaccine distribution strategy, and as of early August 2021, approximately 90% of eligible British Columbians had received a first dose. The province has five health regions: Island Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, Interior Health, and Northern Health. Hospitalizations and Cases Over Time: During the first wave, hospitalizations in B.C. rose to over 100 but slowly declined through the summer of 2020. In future waves, hospitalizations surged to over 300, leading to the postponement of surgeries. The highly transmissible Delta variant caused a rapid increase in cases and hospitalizations in July and August 2021. The Omicron variant led to a compressed timeline of increased cases and hospitalizations in December 2021, but with lower critical cases and deaths. Hospitalization data by age, vaccine status, and health conditions showed that further restrictions during the Omicron wave were not necessary. Vaccinations: Vaccination clinics opened to the general public in March 2021, with a steady increase in pace. Regional differences emerged, with higher vaccination rates in Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria compared to the Interior and northern B.C. Third doses were provided to long-term care and assisted living residents starting in October 2021, and to the general population by May 2022. 4th and 5th Waves: The 4th and 5th waves saw a steady increase in vaccinations from March to June 2021, leading to a rapid decline in daily cases, active cases, and hospitalizations. The Delta variant caused a surge in cases and hospitalizations in July and August 2021. The Omicron variant led to a rapid increase in cases and hospitalizations in December 2021, but with lower hospitalization rates compared to previous waves. Cases by Region and Age: The Fraser Health region was the biggest area of transmission for several months starting in October 2020. Surrey and Abbotsford in the Lower Mainland had the highest per capita transmission rates, with approximately 8.5% and 7.9% of their populations infected by November 2021. During the first wave, most positive cases were in individuals over 50, but from summer 2020 onwards, cases shifted predominantly to those under 50, especially between 20 and 40 years old. Flattening the Curve: B.C. successfully contained the initial outbreak relatively early, with consistently lower COVID-19-related death rates compared to other provinces, U.S. states, and Western European countries. Care Homes: B.C. regularly changed its policy on releasing data for care homes, initially treating any positive case as an outbreak. From December 2020 to February 2021, approximately 91% of long-term care home residents received the vaccine, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths. As of December 2021, over 1,200 COVID-19 deaths in B.C. were linked to care homes, assisted living, or independent seniors' facilities. Testing: B.C. initially led in testing rates but fell behind as other countries ramped up their testing capacity. The positivity rate, an indicator of pandemic containment, fluctuated over time, reaching over 20% during the Omicron wave. These key points provide an overview of the COVID-19 situation in B.C., including the impact of vaccinations, variants, and regional differences on hospitalizations and cases. The data and trends can inform forecasts and preparedness for future waves or outbreaks.

Title: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Demand for Personal Support Workers: Labour Market Trends & Skills Needs
Publisher: Toronto Metropolitan University
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for Personal Support Workers (PSWs), particularly those working in home and community care (home support workers). To analyze labor demands, the article relies on online job posting data from Vicinity Jobs, as there is no specific classification for PSWs in the National Occupation Classification (NOC) system. By focusing on the NOC code for "home support workers, housekeepers, and related occupations (4412)," the article aims to understand the extent and patterns of the growing demand for PSWs during the pandemic. This information can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying the skills and certifications needed to fill the gap in the healthcare system.

Title: False claims about COVID-19 must be repeatedly debunked, study finds
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Researchers from several universities conducted a study, published in Nature Human Behaviour, to assess the effectiveness of fact-checking in correcting misinformation about COVID-19. The study found that while fact-checking can immediately reduce misperceptions, these effects do not persist over time, and beliefs in misinformation can resurface. This suggests that repeated and frequent exposure to fact-checking is necessary to effectively address and dispel COVID-19 misinformation. The study has implications for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it highlights the need for a long-term strategy to convince people to adopt new understandings and prevent the re-emergence of harmful misperceptions that could influence their health decisions and behaviors.

Title: Joe Rogan's coroanvirus misinformation, explained
Publisher: The Washington Post
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the ongoing debate about misinformation and "cancel culture," using the example of Joe Rogan, a popular podcast host who has been accused of spreading coronavirus misinformation on his show. The article identifies several dubious and false claims made by Rogan and his guests, including: 1. Ivermectin as a cure for COVID-19: Biologist Bret Weinstein claimed on Rogan's show that ivermectin is highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infections and could be "the end of covid." However, the study he cited was later found to have major data issues, and there is no evidence that ivermectin is a silver bullet against the virus. 2. "Mass-formation hypnosis": Vaccine scientist Robert Malone, a guest on Rogan's show, promoted the pseudoscientific idea that a third of the population is being hypnotized to follow the mainstream media and health officials. This concept is not recognized by psychologists and can undermine trust in public health measures. 3. Planned pandemic and suppressed treatments: Cardiologist Peter McCullough claimed on Rogan's show that the pandemic was planned and early treatments were deliberately suppressed to promote fear and suffering. These claims are baseless and conspiratorial. 4. False claims about vaccine trials and asymptomatic transmission: McCullough also made false assertions about a coronavirus vaccine trial in Australia and downplayed the role of asymptomatic transmission, contrary to available data. 5. Reinfection and natural immunity: McCullough claimed that people cannot get COVID-19 twice and that natural immunity is permanent. This misinformation can lead people to believe they are immune and ignore precautions. 6. Microchip conspiracy theories: Rogan has given credence to conspiracy theories about microchips being injected into people's arms to detect COVID-19, similar to those spread by Infowars' Alex Jones. 7. Characterization of COVID-19 vaccines as "gene therapy": Rogan claimed that COVID-19 vaccines are not traditional vaccines but rather gene therapy. This claim is incorrect, as mRNA vaccines do not modify a person's genes. The article concludes that while the debate about censorship and free speech is complex, it is important to address the dissemination of misinformation, especially when it relates to public health issues like COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

Title: Blood pressure up? COVID-19 pandemic could be to blame
Publisher: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is releasing new tools to help communities across the country better prepare for and respond to potential surges of COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 Surge Tool Kit provides information, tools, and resources to help healthcare systems and communities understand the many factors that contribute to their capacity to effectively treat patients during a surge of COVID-19 cases. This includes understanding the capacity of local healthcare systems, such as inpatient and intensive care beds and mechanical ventilators, as well as the healthcare workforce and supplies of key therapeutics. It also includes understanding COVID-19 levels in the community, such as community transmission, hospitalizations, and test positivity. By understanding these factors, communities can better prepare for and respond to potential surges in COVID-19 patients. For example, if a community is experiencing high levels of COVID-19 transmission and hospitalizations, they may need to implement measures to help reduce the spread of the virus, such as masking and social distancing. They may also need to increase their healthcare system capacity by adding beds or staffing. The tool kit includes a variety of resources, such as data visualization tools, modeling reports, and fact sheets, that can help communities make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and implement public health measures to prevent COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. One key component of the tool kit is the COVID-19 Community Profile Report, which provides detailed information on COVID-19 indicators at the county level, including community transmission, hospitalizations, and test positivity. This report can help communities understand the current situation and identify areas where additional resources or interventions may be needed. Another important tool is the COVID-19 Surge Capacity Estimator, which helps healthcare facilities estimate their surge capacity for inpatient beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and ventilators. This can help hospitals and healthcare systems plan for potential surges in COVID-19 patients and determine if they need to increase their capacity or request additional resources. In addition to these tools, the tool kit also includes resources on how to protect healthcare personnel, manage patient care during a surge, and use therapeutics effectively. It also provides information on how to communicate with the public about COVID-19 surges and the importance of vaccination and other preventive measures. By using the tools and resources in the COVID-19 Surge Tool Kit, communities and healthcare systems can better prepare for and respond to potential surges in COVID-19 cases, helping to ensure that patients receive the care they need and that the impact of the virus on communities is minimized.

Title: Politicizing COVID-19 vaccination efforts has fuelled vaccine hesitancy
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article raises concerns about the increasingly political nature of vaccine policy in Canada, including proposals for vaccine mandates, third-dose policies, and mandatory vaccination for children. The authors, who are clinical providers with experience in implementing vaccination programs, argue that punitive policies towards the unvaccinated may be counterproductive and that the majority of vaccinations have resulted from proactive community engagement, counseling, and outreach efforts by healthcare providers, public health agencies, and community leaders. They criticize Ontario's booster rollout during the Omicron wave, highlighting disparities in access and uptake across different communities and vulnerable groups. The article also questions the mandate of third doses for children, considering the potential societal impact and the fact that the vaccine for this age group has only recently been approved. They emphasize that two doses remain highly protective against severe disease for most people. Additionally, they raise uncertainties about the duration of protection from booster shots and the role of infection-derived immunity. The authors caution that political interference and divisive vaccine mandate policies may erode trust in healthcare providers and compromise the effectiveness of future public health interventions. They advocate for policies that increase resources for proactive uptake, outreach, and empowerment, rather than solely relying on mandates and penalties.

Title: Global analysis of health care waste in the context of COVID-19
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
The article highlights the challenges in managing healthcare waste, particularly in least developed countries, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on waste management systems. Here's a summary, along with some key facts that can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in healthcare waste, further straining already under-resourced healthcare facilities, especially in least developed countries. The report quantifies the additional healthcare waste generated due to COVID-19 and examines the deficiencies in current waste management systems. It also provides recommendations and best practices to reduce the impact of healthcare waste on human and environmental health, promoting a "win-win" scenario for PPE use, testing, and vaccinations that are safe and environmentally sustainable. Important Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Globally, 1 in 3 healthcare facilities do not safely manage healthcare waste, according to the latest data from 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large increases in healthcare waste, putting further pressure on healthcare systems and the environment. Proper waste management is crucial for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other healthcare-acquired infections, as well as reducing environmental impacts. Recommendations in the report are aligned with the WHO manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19 and target global, national, and facility-level actions. By implementing improved waste management practices and addressing the deficiencies highlighted in the report, healthcare facilities can better manage the increased waste generated during the pandemic. This, in turn, can help ensure the safety of patients, healthcare workers, and the environment, and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems, providing valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines makes a life-saving difference to all countries
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the impact of vaccine inequity on COVID-19 hospitalizations and highlights that inequitable vaccine distribution provides little benefit to high-income countries (HICs) in the long run. Here's a summary of the key points: Inequitable vaccine allocation strategies lead to a faster decline in cases in HICs but a slower decline in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the first year, compared to equitable strategies. Delaying vaccinations in LMICs prolongs the pandemic globally and leads to a rebound of cases in LMICs, increasing the risk of new strains emerging. Prioritizing countries with higher incidence, prevalence, or mortality can contain the virus, but if an extremely transmissible strain emerges, densely populated countries should be prioritized. Equitable vaccine allocation curbs the spread of new strains, while inequitable allocation leads to an earlier peak of new strains. Vaccine donation is a practical pathway to equity, protecting both HICs and LMICs. HICs benefit from donating vaccines before vaccinating their entire population. Donating vaccines only to neighboring LMICs has limited effects, and donating to a larger proportion of LMICs can lead to an earlier end to the pandemic. The model predicts that inequitable vaccine allocation provides little benefit to HICs in terms of reducing hospitalizations as it extends the pandemic and increases the risk of new strains. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of equitable global vaccine allocation to control the pandemic and reduce the burden on healthcare systems, including hospitalizations.
