Title: Why might seasonal allergies seem worse after having COVID-19?
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: There may be a link between seasonal allergies and long COVID, a condition where symptoms of COVID-19 persist or develop after the initial infection has cleared. Research suggests that long COVID may be associated with heightened mast cell activation, similar to what is seen in people with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a condition causing frequent and severe allergic reactions. However, more research is needed to establish a definite connection. Long COVID can affect multiple organs and symptoms can vary in severity. Some common symptoms include difficulty breathing, tiredness, headache, sneezing, and dry skin, which overlap with seasonal allergy symptoms. People with pre-existing allergies or asthma may find that a viral infection worsens their allergy symptoms and triggers asthma attacks. While allergies are caused by the body mistaking a harmless substance as a threat, viral infections can also trigger similar immune responses. It is important for individuals experiencing prolonged COVID-19 symptoms or worsening allergies to consult a doctor, who may refer them to an allergist for specialized care. The American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends seeing an allergist if allergies are impacting daily activities, causing frequent sinus infections, or failing to respond to over-the-counter medications. To answer your question about forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide direct information on that topic. However, understanding the link between COVID-19 and allergies, as well as the potential for long COVID, could be a factor considered by healthcare professionals when assessing the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients, especially those with pre-existing allergies or respiratory conditions.

Title: Is the new Covid-19 booster for you? Our medical analyst explains
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article provides an overview of the updated CDC guidance on COVID-19 boosters and who is now eligible to receive the second bivalent booster. Here is a summary, along with some important facts to help forecast hospitalizations: Two groups are now eligible for a second COVID-19 bivalent booster: individuals aged 65 and older, and immunocompromised individuals aged 6 and older. The composition of the bivalent booster remains the same, targeting the original coronavirus strain and the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants. Receiving a booster now will not preclude someone from getting another vaccine in the fall if an updated version becomes available. Unvaccinated individuals aged 6 and older who receive one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent booster will be considered up to date on their vaccinations. Previously, vaccinated individuals need at least one dose of the bivalent booster to be considered up to date, regardless of how many original monovalent vaccine doses they have received. The CDC has issued a permissive recommendation, allowing individuals to choose whether to get the additional booster based on their personal medical circumstances. To help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of boosters. The updated boosters are effective in reducing severe illness, which can help reduce hospitalizations. However, it is also important to monitor the circulation of new variants and the effectiveness of the boosters against them. Additionally, the CDC's permissive recommendation may impact hospitalization rates, as individuals can choose to wait for updated boosters or seek additional protection based on their personal risk assessment. Overall, the availability of boosters for high-risk groups and the option for additional protection for others can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system by lowering the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization.

Posted: 4 days ago
This article discusses a research project led by Dr. Esyllt Jones, a historian of infectious diseases, that aims to document and preserve the untold stories and experiences of marginalized communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project, titled "Democratizing Pandemic Recovery: Local Health and Housing Advocacy for Equitable COVID Recovery in Canada and Guatemala," has received funding from the New Frontiers in Research Fund and will be ongoing for two years, concluding in 2025. The project has a particular focus on the themes of health and housing security and will examine the community responses and activism that shaped government actions and vaccine rollouts. The research team will work with community health centers and organizations in Winnipeg, such as the Women's Health Clinic and NorWest Co-op Community Health, as well as a community in rural Guatemala, to understand their strategies for protection and equitable recovery. An art-based approach, including visual representations and murals, will be used to engage with community members and capture their needs and desired transformations. The project emphasizes the importance of including marginalized voices, especially those from rural Indigenous communities, in the historical record, and ensuring that the knowledge gained contributes to more equitable and responsive public health services and policies in the future. The findings of the project will be archived in university archives and made publicly accessible through digital engagement, with the goal of sharing knowledge and benefiting communities worldwide. While the article does not provide specific data or forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations, it highlights the importance of community activism and advocacy in shaping pandemic responses and the potential for these experiences to inform more effective and equitable public health strategies in future crises.

Title: The N.L. government has been downplaying COVID-19 deaths for months
Publisher: CBC.ca

The article highlights concerns about the transparency and accuracy of COVID-19 data reporting in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The provincial government's COVID-19 dashboard, the sole source of pandemic data for the public, has been criticized for downplaying the number of coronavirus deaths and not providing enough information for individuals to assess their risk accurately. Key points include: The government has been quietly changing the numbers, making it difficult to track the total death count. As of March 29, the total death count was 339, an increase of 6 from the previous day, despite no new deaths being reported. The government changed its coronavirus updates at the beginning of 2023, switching from providing up-to-date information to summarizing data from a two-week reporting period. This change has led to a discrepancy between the announced "new" deaths and the total number of deaths. The Health Department explained that some deaths within the reporting period may not be attributed to COVID-19 until after the deadline, leading to an undercount in the "New Deaths" column. However, these deaths are included in the age and regional breakdowns, making the total death count higher than reported. The Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, stated that the reporting method adheres to epidemiological standards and that the number of deaths may not be the most important factor for individuals to assess their risk. She emphasized that the amount of circulating virus, cases, and hospitalizations provide more meaningful information. Critics argue that the lack of transparency in reporting could give people a false sense of security and impact their decisions about protective measures like mask-wearing. They call for more transparent and comprehensive data reporting, including information on hospitalizations and testing positivity rates. Health Minister Tom Osborne defended the dashboard, stating that Public Health is responsible for the data and has earned the government's trust. He denied any political motivation behind the dashboard and expressed willingness to review it with Public Health. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, it is important to have transparent and comprehensive data reporting. The number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are key indicators for assessing the severity of the pandemic and making informed decisions about public health measures. However, the current data reporting in Newfoundland and Labrador may not provide a complete picture of the pandemic's impact.

Title: What the new Covid-19 vaccine guidance means for you
Publisher: Vox.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The CDC and FDA have issued new, streamlined vaccine recommendations for COVID-19, focusing on the bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine, which offers protection against older and newer strains of the virus, is now recommended as the primary vaccine for everyone, replacing the need for a booster shot. The new guidance applies to updated mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, as the original vaccine series is no longer available in the US. Currently, everyone is advised to receive at least one bivalent vaccine dose to be considered up-to-date with their vaccinations. However, only higher-risk individuals should receive repeat bivalent vaccinations. This includes people aged 65 and older, who are at the highest risk of severe disease and hospitalization from COVID-19, and those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised aged 5 and older. For healthy individuals aged 6 to 64 who have already received a bivalent vaccine, one dose is considered sufficient for now. The CDC strongly recommends that individuals who have never been vaccinated or have only received the older, monovalent versions of the vaccine get the bivalent vaccine. This is because the bivalent vaccine offers broader protection against newer Omicron variants, providing better protection than vaccines that only target earlier strains. Unvaccinated children aged 6 months to 5 years can also receive the bivalent vaccine, with different manufacturers offering different dosing regimens for this age group. It's important to note that the FDA and CDC have used cautious language in their guidance, indicating that repeat vaccination is not strongly advised for everyone due to limited data. However, they highlight the eligibility for additional doses, particularly for higher-risk groups. These recommendations are expected to change again in the fall when updated versions of the bivalent vaccine are likely to be released to address the latest viral variants.
