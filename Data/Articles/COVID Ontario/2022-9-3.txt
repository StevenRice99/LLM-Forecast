Posted: 3 days ago
Ontario's top doctor, Dr. Kieran Moore, announced on Wednesday that the province is lifting the mandatory five-day isolation requirement for individuals who test positive for COVID-19. This decision is part of Ontario's strategy for the upcoming fall respiratory illness season, despite a slight increase in COVID-19 cases in the province as indicated by wastewater data. Dr. Moore stated that the pandemic is no longer in a "crisis phase" and requires long-term management. He also mentioned that the seventh wave has passed its peak but cautioned that the virus is still circulating in the community. The new guidelines provided by Dr. Moore recommend that individuals with any respiratory illness symptoms stay home until their symptoms improve for at least 24 hours. Additionally, those with a fever should remain at home until it subsides, and those with gastrointestinal issues should isolate for at least 48 hours after their symptoms improve. Dr. Moore also advised wearing a mask in public for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and avoiding visits to vulnerable individuals or high-risk settings during this period. The shift in strategy has raised concerns among some, including Ontario Liberal health critic Dr. Adil Shamji, who pointed out the strain on hospitals and healthcare staff shortages over the summer. He questioned the timing of the announcement, given the upcoming respiratory illness season and the current state of hospitals. Dr. Moore also announced the expansion of COVID-19 booster eligibility to children aged 5 to 11, encouraging parents to book appointments through the vaccine portal or local health providers. He emphasized the importance of continuing to wear masks, staying up to date with vaccinations, and staying home when sick to stay healthy during the fall season. Additionally, he expressed concern about delays in routine immunizations and outlined plans to address this issue in schools.

A B.C. dad is "over the moon" after his photo of a unique cloud formation was featured on his favourite TV show, thanks to a viral TikTok campaign by his daughter. Last week, 19-year-old Victoria Carter posted a video to TikTok explaining that her dad, Ian Carter, had always wanted to see one of his photos of clouds featured on CBC's B.C. weather forecast. The video, which included a photo of a rare undulatus asperatus cloud formation taken by Ian in July 2017, quickly went viral, garnering over 100,000 views. Following the widespread attention, Ian's wish came true. On Jan. 12, CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe featured Ian's photo on air, calling it "spectacular." "I was over the moon," Ian said. "I was so excited." Ian has been an avid cloud watcher and photographer for years, often going on trips to chase storms and capture unique cloud formations. He said he was humbled that so many people enjoyed his photo. "It's a very proud moment for me and for my daughter as well," he said. As for Victoria, she said she was shocked by the response to her video and was happy she could help her dad achieve his dream. In addition to the heartwarming story of a father and daughter, the article also includes a forecast for COVID-19 hospitalizations in B.C. The province is expected to reach a peak in hospitalizations in mid-January, with numbers remaining high but stable through February. This forecast is based on data and modelling presented by the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group. The group also predicts that the Omicron variant will infect a large portion of the population, but vaccinations and boosters will help reduce the severity of illness and prevent hospitalizations.

Title: Engineering grads put time and money into COVID-19 vaccine solutions | Waterloo News
Publisher: University of Waterloo
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Refana, a startup with ties to Waterloo Engineering, is developing a new vaccine technology called RefanaVax-MV to address the evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccine is designed as a tri-valent vaccine, offering protection against three variants of the virus, including Delta and Omicron. This multi-valent approach is an improvement over previous mono-valent vaccines that only protect against a single variant. The RefanaVax-MV vaccine is created using a Whole Inactivated Virus (WIV)-based approach, providing better overall coverage by targeting the full genetic structure of the virus. This technology has several advantages, including lower costs, easier distribution, and a strong safety profile based on established vaccine design principles. Refana has also designed a modular manufacturing system that reduces capital and operating costs, making localized manufacturing more feasible, especially in less-developed countries. The development of the RefanaVax-MV vaccine is a result of the collaboration between Refana and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (ITTRI) in Chicago. The vaccine technology is significant because, according to Mark Turchan, one of the early investors in Refana, there are still over three billion people worldwide who are not fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The article also highlights the involvement of two brothers, Mark and Glenn Turchan, graduates of Waterloo Engineering, who are using their engineering problem-solving skills to help shape the future of the company and contribute to the fight against the virus.

Title: COVID-19 mortality among racialized populations in Canada and its association with income
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the association between ethno-cultural background, socioeconomic status, and health outcomes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. It highlights the increased health risks faced by racialized populations, particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods. The study uses data from the 2016 Canadian Census Health and Environmental Cohort (CanCHEC) to estimate COVID-19 mortality rates among racialized populations and explores the impact of low-income status on mortality within these groups. Key findings include: Racialized populations in Canada had significantly higher COVID-19 mortality rates compared to non-racialized and non-Indigenous populations, with Black people having the highest age-standardized mortality rate, followed by South Asians and Chinese. Males had higher COVID-19 mortality rates than females across all racialized populations. Low-income status further increased the risk of COVID-19 mortality, especially for Black people living in low-income neighborhoods, who had almost 3 times higher mortality rates compared to Black people not living in low income. Logistic regression showed that the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 remained significantly higher for Black and South Asian populations, even after controlling for other factors such as sex, age, housing suitability, and dwelling type. Living in an apartment was associated with the highest odds of dying from COVID-19, even after controlling for income and other factors. The relationship between low income and COVID-19 mortality among racialized populations may be explained by factors such as inadequate housing, poorer access to healthcare, and experiences of racism. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following important facts can be considered: Racialized populations, particularly Black people and South Asians, have higher COVID-19 mortality rates, indicating a higher risk of severe disease. Low-income status further exacerbates the risk of COVID-19 mortality, especially for Black people. Housing plays a significant role, with those living in apartments or unsuitable housing having a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Experiencing racism and having poorer access to healthcare may contribute to worse health outcomes among racialized populations. By considering these factors, public health officials and policymakers can develop targeted interventions to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations among high-risk groups, such as improving access to healthcare, addressing housing issues, and tackling systemic racism.

Here is a summary of the article: Title: COVID-19 Hospitalization Forecasting with Machine Learning The article discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. The authors highlight the importance of accurate forecasting for healthcare capacity planning and resource allocation. They discuss the challenges in traditional forecasting methods and how ML can improve prediction accuracy. Key points from the article: 1. Machine Learning Approach: The authors propose using ML models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. LSTM models are chosen for their ability to handle time series data and capture long-term dependencies. 2. Data Sources: The model inputs include historical COVID-19 hospitalization data, demographic information, mobility data, and health indicators such as vaccination rates and the prevalence of underlying health conditions. These data sources are combined to train and make predictions with the LSTM model. 3. Model Training and Evaluation: The authors train and evaluate their LSTM models using data from multiple US counties. They use a rolling forecasting origin evaluation method, simulating real-time forecasting, and assess the models' performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 4. Results: The LSTM models outperform traditional statistical forecasting methods, such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), in terms of accuracy. The models can effectively capture the nonlinear relationships and complex patterns in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions. 5. Impact and Implications: Accurate COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts can help healthcare administrators make informed decisions about resource allocation, staffing, and capacity planning. This can ultimately improve patient care and reduce the strain on healthcare systems during pandemic waves. 6. Adaptability: The ML approach is adaptable and can incorporate new data streams as they become available, such as information about new variants or changes in mobility patterns. This adaptability ensures that forecasts remain accurate and up-to-date. 7. Ethical Considerations: The authors discuss the ethical implications of using ML for COVID-19 forecasting, emphasizing the responsibility to ensure that forecasts do not exacerbate existing inequalities and that the benefits are distributed equitably across populations. In terms of important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article suggests that: Historical COVID-19 hospitalization data is a critical input. Understanding past trends and patterns can help inform future predictions. Demographic information matters. Factors such as age, population density, and the presence of underlying health conditions can influence hospitalization rates and should be included in forecasting models. Mobility data is crucial. Changes in human mobility patterns can impact the spread of the virus and, consequently, hospitalization rates. Vaccination rates play a significant role. Higher vaccination rates can reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections and decrease hospitalization risks. Incorporating data on new variants is essential. The emergence of new COVID-19 variants with higher transmissibility or increased severity can impact hospitalization forecasts. Healthcare capacity constraints should be considered. Limitations in terms of available beds, ICU capacity, and healthcare staff can influence hospitalization rates and need to be factored into forecasting models. Overall, this article highlights the potential of machine learning to improve COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts and the importance of considering various data streams to make accurate predictions. Accurate forecasts can ultimately help better manage the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems and save lives.

Title: Abdominal pain patterns during COVID-19: an observational study
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The study investigates the prevalence of abdominal pain in patients with COVID-19, finding a higher rate (23.7%) than previously reported in literature (14.5%). The authors attribute this difference to their comprehensive data collection method, which included manual extraction from medical records and consideration of both patient history and physical examinations. Abdominal pain was found to be most frequent in the upper abdomen, specifically the epigastric and right upper regions, with 17.1% of patients reporting a history of right lower region pain and 21.7% experiencing left lower region abdominal tenderness. The study establishes a link between abdominal pain patterns and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Notably, Murphy's sign and right upper region tenderness were associated with more severe COVID-19 cases. The analysis also revealed connections between AST, ALT, and upper region pain history, as well as Murphy's sign and abdominal point tenderness. The study proposes two distinct forms of COVID-19 based on gastrointestinal symptoms and their respective outcomes. The "liver-COVID-19" form is characterized by elevated transaminases, abdominal pain in the right upper region, dyspnea, and a higher likelihood of ICU admission or death. In contrast, the "gut-COVID-19" form is marked by gastric and lower abdomen pain and is associated with less severe outcomes and reduced dyspnea. The study acknowledges limitations, including its retrospective nature and missing data, and calls for further prospective studies to validate the findings and hypotheses presented.

Title: The growing evidence that Covid-19 is leaving people sicker
Publisher: Financial Times
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on global health systems and how it may leave people more susceptible to other serious illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Dr. David Strain of Exeter University believes that COVID-19 has generated an epidemiological aftershock, leaving healthcare systems struggling to cope with the increased demand for resources. Analysis of data from the UK's NHS and the US Department of Veterans Affairs supports this claim, showing significant rises in deaths from heart disease and an increased risk of cardiovascular problems after COVID-19 infection. The article also highlights the need for a more preventive and collaborative approach to healthcare, with a greater emphasis on telehealth and community health workers. However, some researchers caution that it is too early to draw broad conclusions from limited data, and that the increases in certain conditions may be due to inconsistencies in reporting. Nonetheless, clinicians and health leaders are already coping with a higher burden of disease in the population and a shortage of healthcare workers. The pandemic has also led to a re-evaluation of how healthcare is delivered, with a growing understanding of the connection between chronic disease risks and infectious disease outcomes. Experts argue that a more flexible and organized system of risk stratification is needed, utilizing artificial intelligence and self-testing technologies to manage demand. However, patients will also need to be educated and empowered to take more responsibility for their own health. While some believe that the impact of COVID-19 on the landscape of illness may be temporary, others, like Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, argue that the after-effects of COVID-19 will reverberate indefinitely. More data and extensive follow-up studies are needed to fully understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on global health systems and populations.
