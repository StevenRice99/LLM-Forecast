Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
In this article, medical historian Dr. Jacalyn Duffin reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing it to past pandemics and offering insights into the response and impact. Here are the key points: Dr. Duffin's book, "COVID-19: A History," examines the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous pandemics. She predicted a pandemic in 2000, arguing that it was overdue, and compares it to the influenza pandemic of 1918. She highlights that the lethality of COVID-19 could have been worse, and we have been lucky to have better healthcare support and technology compared to previous pandemics. The controversy and disagreement surrounding COVID-19 are not unique, but the power of social media and the internet has amplified these voices and spread misinformation. The Black Death in the 14th century led to the concept of quarantine, with ships being blocked at ports for 40 days ("quaranta giorn" in Italian). The city of Milan also implemented an early form of lockdown. The development of vaccines for COVID-19 was much faster than in the past, partly due to prior research on the spike protein of coronaviruses. Dr. Duffin discusses the "infodemic," a term used by the WHO to describe the massive amount of information, including misinformation, spread during the pandemic. She highlights that denial and scapegoating are common in pandemics. She emphasizes that vaccines have historically helped eradicate diseases, and the benefits outweigh the risks. Finally, Dr. Duffin reflects on the stages of a pandemic, including denial, anger, hard work, and new knowledge. She hopes that the lessons learned from COVID-19 will help improve public health responses in the future. Overall, Dr. Duffin's historical perspective provides valuable insights into the patterns and responses to pandemics, offering a broader understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential ways to improve our handling of future public health crises.

Title: Ontario expecting another wave of COVID-19, top doctor recommends 'layers of protection'
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Ontario's top doctor, Dr. Kieran Moore, has warned that the province could face another wave of COVID-19 infections as early as January. He recommends that residents take "layers of protection," including getting vaccinated and boosted, to protect themselves from a surge in COVID-19 and flu cases during the holidays. Wastewater data shows a recent upward trend in COVID-19 infections, and the number of deaths associated with the virus is also climbing. Moore emphasizes that COVID-19 vaccine protection fades after six months, so boosters are important. He also highlights the importance of flu shots, as influenza is expected to cause deaths in Ontario, including in children. The province has expanded eligibility for the COVID-19 bivalent booster to children aged 5-11 and is encouraging parents to get their children immunized. Moore notes that boosters will help alleviate pressure on pediatric hospitals, which are currently facing a crisis due to high demand for treatment of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, flu, and RSV. However, the number of people getting COVID-19 boosters has declined in recent weeks. Moore stresses the importance of maintaining immunity as the virus continues to evolve.

Title: From COVID-19 to the common cold: UBC scientists identify broadly-effective, infection-halting compound
Publisher: UBC Faculty of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
A team of University of British Columbia (UBC) researchers has identified a compound that could eventually lead to a treatment for a variety of viral infections, including COVID-19, with the potential to stop the spread of viruses in their tracks. The compound, called KOW24, works by targeting and blocking a critical step of viral infection the fusion of the virus with the host cell. This process is common across a range of viruses, from influenza to coronaviruses, and even the common cold. By developing a compound that inhibits this fusion process, the researchers believe they have found a potential broad-spectrum antiviral agent. In laboratory tests, KOW24 showed strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and other human coronaviruses, such as the ones that cause the common cold. One of the lead researchers, Dr. Sriram Subramaniam, a professor at UBC and a senior scientist at the Vancouver Prostate Centre and the BC Cancer Research Centre, highlighted the potential impact of their findings: "We're excited about the prospect of KOW24 becoming a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. With this single compound, we may be able to treat a number of viral infections and relieve the burden that these infections pose on our healthcare system and society." The development of KOW24 is a result of a collaboration between UBC researchers and scientists from the University of Montreal and the National Institutes of Health in the United States. The team used advanced imaging techniques to visualize the compound's effectiveness in blocking viral infection. KOW24 specifically targets a key protein, known as the "spike protein," which is essential for the virus to bind and enter host cells. By preventing this interaction, KOW24 effectively stops the virus from infecting healthy cells. The researchers also found that KOW24 has a high barrier to resistance, meaning it is less likely for viruses to develop resistance to the compound, a common challenge with antiviral treatments. While the research is still in its early stages, the team is optimistic about the potential for KOW24 to be developed into a treatment for a range of viral infections. Clinical trials and further testing will be necessary to confirm the compound's safety and effectiveness in humans. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, this development could be a significant step forward. If KOW24 proves effective in clinical trials, it could offer a new tool to help manage and control viral outbreaks, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and potentially saving lives. However, it is important to note that the development of antiviral treatments is a complex and lengthy process, and the availability of such treatments will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval and production capabilities. In the meantime, public health measures, vaccinations, and existing antiviral treatments continue to play a crucial role in managing COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: Chinese struggle to ‘summon the courage’ to live with COVID-19
Publisher: Al Jazeera English
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
For three years, China has strictly enforced a zero-COVID policy, which has disrupted the lives of its citizens and hindered economic growth. However, following recent protests, the government has abruptly relaxed some restrictions, causing confusion and fear among the population. Many vulnerable individuals, including those with underlying health conditions and the elderly, remain unvaccinated due to government hesitancy and concern about side effects. As a result, experts predict a surge in COVID-19 cases, particularly during the winter, that could overwhelm the country's medical resources. The government's previous fear-inducing narrative about the virus has contributed to anxiety and depression among the population, with many fearing infection and unsure how to cope with the changing situation. A government health adviser has acknowledged the challenge of completely stopping the virus's spread, and a recent survey found that fear of infection is a top concern for those hesitant to travel. As restrictions ease, there are concerns about the impact of rising cases on vulnerable individuals and the mental health of the wider population.

Title: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy associated with increased risk of traffic crashes in Ontario: study
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A recent study published in The American Journal of Medicine suggests a correlation between COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and an increased risk of traffic crashes in Ontario. The study, involving over 11 million people, found that unvaccinated individuals accounted for 25% of traffic crashes during the follow-up period, resulting in a 72% increased relative risk compared to vaccinated individuals. The lead investigator, Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier, attributed this to a potential connection between neglecting health recommendations and disregarding road safety guidelines. While the COVID-19 vaccine does not directly prevent crashes, the study highlights a pattern of behavior where individuals who disregard public health advice may also be more likely to ignore road safety rules. These findings could be useful in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying high-risk groups and encouraging safer driving practices.

Title: The risks of POTS after COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection: more studies are needed
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the possible link between the COVID-19 vaccine and Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. While vaccines are generally a groundbreaking way to reduce mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases, there have been reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, including POTS. The study published in Nature Cardiovascular Research found a 33% increased risk of POTS and associated diagnoses within 90 days after COVID-19 vaccination, compared to the 90 days before. The risk of POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection was even higher, with a 52% increased risk rate. POTS is more common in women of reproductive age and teenagers and can also occur as a post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The study's limitations include the accuracy of POTS diagnoses and the general awareness and diagnostic vigilance of the condition. Despite this, the study is important as it establishes POTS as a possible adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination and emphasizes that POTS is more common after SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing valuable evidence to address vaccine hesitancy. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations due to POTS is challenging, as the condition is often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. However, the study's findings suggest that POTS may be among the most common adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, and the higher rate of POTS diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to future hospitalization trends. Understanding the link between POTS and COVID-19 vaccination and infection can help improve patient care and management, and further research is needed to determine causation and underlying immune-mediated mechanisms.

Title: Does the COVID-19 vaccine weaken the immune system? What to know
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: There is a common misconception that the COVID-19 vaccine weakens the immune system, but this is not true. COVID-19 vaccines help the body create immunity or resistance to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by mimicking an infection. This prepares the body's immune system to fight the virus more effectively and helps prevent serious disease and hospitalization. The vaccines do not transmit COVID-19 as they do not contain the whole virus. The immune system creates T cells and B cells in response to the vaccine, which provide long-lasting protection. Data shows that COVID-19 vaccines are extremely effective, and the majority of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated. However, there are concerns about the frequent use of booster shots, as they may weaken the immune response, according to some European regulators. The article also addresses other myths and misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines, emphasizing that they are safe and effective. Vaccination offers individual and community protection, reduces hospitalizations, and saves lives. It is recommended for everyone who is able, including those with underlying health conditions, pregnant and nursing individuals, and even children over 6 months old.

Title: Potential New Treatment for “Brain Fog” in Long COVID Patients
Publisher: Yale School of Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Yale researchers have published initial evidence suggesting that the combination of two existing drugs, guanfacine and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), can effectively treat "brain fog" in patients with long COVID. Brain fog is a common symptom of long COVID, characterized by cognitive deficits such as lack of mental clarity, poor focus, memory problems, and difficulty with multi-tasking. While the sample size of the study was small, the results are promising, with eight out of twelve patients reporting substantial benefits, including improved memory, organizational skills, and multi-tasking ability. Guanfacine, originally developed for ADHD, strengthens prefrontal cortex connections and protects against inflammation and stress, while NAC is a robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. The researchers plan to conduct larger, placebo-controlled clinical trials to establish the effectiveness of this drug combination in treating post-COVID-19 neurocognitive deficits. In the meantime, long COVID patients suffering from brain fog can ask their physicians about the possibility of prescribing guanfacine, while NAC is available over the counter. The researchers also hope that this drug combination could potentially benefit other patient groups experiencing brain fog due to conditions such as post-Lyme, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and multiple sclerosis (MS).

Title: Apparent risks of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome diagnoses after COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-Cov-2 Infection
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The study found that Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) diagnoses occurred more frequently after COVID-19 vaccination than before, with a higher risk of new POTS diagnoses in vaccinated individuals compared to those infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the risk of POTS after vaccination was lower than after infection. Similar observations were made for myocarditis, which was considered a benchmark condition. The study suggests a potential association between COVID-19 vaccination and POTS, but further research is needed to establish causality. The study has limitations, including data from a single medical center and the possibility of underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of POTS, highlighting the need for larger, more diverse studies to assess the generalizability of the findings. Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of emerging vaccine side effects and emphasizes the importance of further research to enhance medical trust and improve vaccine uptake.
