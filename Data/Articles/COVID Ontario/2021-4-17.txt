Title: H1N1 Influenza vs. COVID-19 Comparison: Similarities & Differences
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are both global outbreaks that have had significant impacts on public health. Here are some key facts and comparisons between the two: Timing: The H1N1 pandemic occurred in 2009-2010, while COVID-19 began in 2020 and is still ongoing. Worldwide deaths: H1N1 caused approximately 284,000 deaths in the first 12 months, while COVID-19 has led to about 2,000,000 deaths worldwide in the first 12 months. Viruses: H1N1 influenza was caused by the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, while COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Transmission: Both pandemics are transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols, contact with contaminated surfaces, and asymptomatic spread. Contagiousness: COVID-19 is more contagious than H1N1. People with COVID-19 are contagious from 2 days before symptoms begin until 10 days after testing positive, while those with H1N1 are contagious from 1 day before symptoms until about 5-7 days after becoming sick. Symptoms: Both pandemics share similar symptoms, including fever, fatigue, cough, body aches, headache, sore throat, and digestive issues. However, loss of smell and taste are unique to COVID-19. Symptom onset: H1N1 symptoms typically appear suddenly within 1-4 days, while COVID-19 symptoms develop more gradually over 2-14 days. Impact by age: H1N1 primarily impacted people younger than 30, while COVID-19 has had a more severe impact on adults over 30. Severity: In both pandemics, most cases (94-98% for H1N1, 80% for COVID-19) are mild. However, COVID-19 has a higher proportion of severe and critical cases (20%) compared to H1N1 (2-6%). Risk factors: Older age (65+), pregnancy, and certain underlying health conditions are risk factors for both pandemics. Complications: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, and inflammation of heart, brain, or muscle tissues are possible complications of both diseases. COVID-19 has additional complications, including long-haul COVID-19, blood clots, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Treatments: Supportive care is common for both, and antiviral medications are available for each: oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for H1N1 and remdesivir (Veklury) for COVID-19. Vaccines: Vaccines have been developed for both pandemics. These comparisons highlight the similarities and differences between the two pandemics in terms of their impact, transmission, symptoms, and treatments. Understanding these aspects can help in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by considering factors such as contagiousness, severity, and the effectiveness of available treatments and vaccines.

Title: Ford announces new restrictions as COVID-19 cases threaten to remain high all summer
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Due to an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases, Ontario has extended its stay-at-home order to a minimum of six weeks, increased police enforcement powers, and restricted outdoor activities. Despite these measures, health experts warn that cases will remain high through the summer if essential workers do not receive additional support and paid sick days. Ontario's COVID-19 science advisory table projects that a combination of a six-week stay-at-home order and 100,000 daily vaccinations could flatten the curve. However, more stringent measures and 300,000 daily vaccinations are required to reduce cases to approximately 2,000 per day. Ontario's healthcare system is under immense pressure, with hospitals in Toronto preparing for a continued influx of patients and the province requesting additional critical care staff from the federal government. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has criticized the new measures as a "Black Friday" for civil liberties, and police services in several regions have stated they will not conduct random vehicle or individual stops. Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, has urged the province to mandate paid sick days and prioritize vaccinations for essential workers.

Title: Loss of smell and COVID-19: Up to 80% of those infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus report losing their sense of smell
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the loss of smell, known as anosmia, as a common symptom of COVID-19, experienced by 30-80% of people with the virus. The likely target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to be the supporting cells in the nose that support the growth of olfactory neurons, which transmit smell signals to the brain. The article highlights the work of researchers from Harvard Medical School who analyzed tissue samples to identify the cells containing the ACE2 receptor, which the virus attaches to for infection. The article also mentions the work of Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist Jay Piccirillo, who has seen an increase in cases of anosmia in his practice. Piccirillo notes that while most patients regain their sense of smell within two weeks to three months, there are a minority who do not recover their sense of smell or experience a distorted sense of smell (parosmia). Traditional treatments for anosmia include smell training with essential oils and steroid nasal sprays to reduce inflammation and aid in olfactory neuron repair. Piccirillo's group is researching the effectiveness of different treatments, including the use of a wider variety of smells and visual cues during smell training. They are also investigating the potential benefits of using the asthma drug theophylline as a nasal wash to promote cell growth and restore olfactory neuron function. The article emphasizes the impact of anosmia on daily life, including the ability to detect dangerous smells like gas leaks or spoiled food, and the link between smell and taste. Recent research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also infect cells in the mouth, contributing to taste loss. Overall, the article provides insights into the mechanisms of COVID-19-related anosmia and ongoing efforts to develop effective treatments.

Title: People living in apartments and larger households were at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True

Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the relationship between housing characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Canada, specifically in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The analysis is based on data from the 2016 Census of Population and provisional COVID-19 death information up to July 4th, 2020. People living in single-detached houses had the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates in Canada, with 9 deaths per 100,000 people. Those living in high-rise apartments had higher mortality rates, with 2.5 times higher rates in Quebec and twice the rates in Ontario compared to single-detached houses. The amount of living space and the need for close contact with others in apartments are possible contributing factors. Vulnerable populations, such as Indigenous communities and new immigrants, are more likely to live in crowded housing and may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 transmission. Larger households were generally found to have higher COVID-19 mortality rates. In Quebec, the mortality rate was 1.4 times higher for those living with five or more people, while in Ontario, households of five or more had 1.7 times higher rates compared to single-person households. This may be due to increased potential points of contact with the virus and limited options for self-isolation within the home. The median after-tax household income varies by dwelling type, with higher incomes associated with single-detached houses compared to high-rise apartments. Other socio-economic factors not covered in the study may also influence COVID-19 mortality patterns. COVID-19 mortality patterns by dwelling type differed between Ontario and Quebec due to variations in dwelling characteristics. Apartments are more common in Quebec, while Ontario has a higher proportion of high-rise apartments. The findings suggest that housing characteristics and household size can influence COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates. These factors should be considered in public health strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations based on the information in the article, it is important to consider the relationship between COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. While the article focuses on mortality rates, the same factors that influence transmission and mortality can also impact hospitalization rates. Here are some key points to consider: Housing characteristics: The type of dwelling and the amount of living space can impact the transmission of COVID-19. High-density housing, such as high-rise apartments, may contribute to higher transmission rates due to increased close contact with others and shared spaces. Household size: Larger households have been associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, suggesting that more potential points of contact with the virus and limited options for self-isolation may increase the risk of infection and subsequent hospitalization. Socio-economic factors: Lower-income households and vulnerable populations may have higher COVID-19 mortality rates due to various socio-economic factors, including crowded living conditions and limited access to healthcare. These factors could also contribute to higher hospitalization rates. Regional variations: Differences in dwelling characteristics and household sizes between regions can impact COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates. These variations should be considered when forecasting hospitalizations for specific regions. By considering these factors and analyzing data on COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, it may be possible to develop forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Additionally, monitoring changes in housing conditions and social distancing measures can help assess the potential impact on hospitalization rates. However, it is important to note that the relationship between infections and hospitalizations can vary due to various factors, including the availability of healthcare resources, the severity of cases, and the effectiveness of public health measures.

The article discusses the importance of financial literacy in helping people recover from the COVID-19 crisis and highlights the results of a survey of Ontario elementary school teachers' perceptions and practices regarding financial literacy education. Here's a summary: Financial literacy, including understanding concepts like compound interest and applying them to personal finances, can aid in financial recovery and stability. The survey found that teachers strongly favor teaching financial literacy in elementary school, citing benefits such as budgeting and future planning skills. Ontario has recently mandated financial literacy education in grades 1 to 8 and provides supporting resources. Teachers rely on free online resources, some sponsored by financial institutions, which may overlook social factors influencing financial circumstances. The authors recommend government investment in professional development for teachers to enhance their comfort and capacity for effective financial literacy instruction. Providing teachers with the right supports and access to professional development can help ensure students develop the financial literacy skills needed to manage future crises. The article emphasizes the role of financial literacy in personal financial recovery and highlights the need for proper teacher training to ensure effective financial literacy education in schools.

Title: Pandemic Prices: Assessing Inflation in the Months and Years Ahead
Publisher: The White House
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unusual recession, and the recovery is expected to be just as unique. While the main goals are to control the virus, achieve full employment, and make necessary investments for a more resilient and inclusive recovery, economic uncertainties and risks, such as inflation, must be closely monitored. Inflation can be challenging to measure and interpret, and persistently high inflation can harm households' well-being if wages don't increase accordingly. However, low inflation leaves less room for monetary policy to support the economy. The current inflation risks are set against a backdrop of weaker-than-target inflation in the decade preceding the pandemic. Pandemics on the scale of COVID-19 are rare, making it challenging to draw historical parallels for policymaking. However, periods of pandemics or significant economic reallocations, such as demobilization after World War I and II, have seen short bursts of inflation. In the coming months, inflation is expected to increase moderately due to three temporary factors: base effects, supply chain disruptions, and pent-up demand for services. These factors are likely to be transitory, and their impact should diminish as the economy recovers. Base effects refer to the comparison of prices with unusually low levels during the pandemic's onset. Supply chain disruptions and increased production costs may lead to temporary price increases. Pent-up demand for services sensitive to the pandemic, such as travel and dining out, could surge as more people get vaccinated, temporarily outstripping supply. Over the long term, inflation expectations play a crucial role in lasting price pressures. If expectations become untethered from the Federal Reserve's target, it could lead to an inflationary spiral and a "hard landing" for the economy. However, economic "heat" does not necessarily equate to overheating, and an increase in inflation expectations from abnormally low levels is expected and welcome. Market data and surveys suggest that inflation expectations are higher but still within historical levels. The most likely outlook is for inflation to rise moderately due to temporary factors and then ease as actual inflation aligns with longer-run expectations. This transitory inflation aligns with previous episodes in American history following pandemics or rapid labor market shifts.
