Title: What a 4th COVID shot can do for you — and what it can't
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the values most important for forecasting: The highly contagious BA.5 Omicron subvariant is fueling Canada's first summer surge, accounting for close to 40% of cases and leading to a significant rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Research suggests that while a third dose offers a significant increase in protection against infection, hospitalization, and death, a fourth dose gives only marginal benefit against severe COVID-19 for most, including short-lived protection against infection, even in vulnerable groups. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that a second booster should only be given now to those at highest risk of severe COVID-19, while younger Canadians could wait until the fall. Data shows that the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection begins to wane after just several weeks, and protection against infection "quickly decreased" after a fourth shot. The article highlights the importance of increasing uptake of third doses, which research suggests adds significant protection against severe COVID-19. Experts emphasize that expanding fourth doses to younger Canadians now may not have a significant impact on the spread of BA.5 across the country and could potentially do more harm than good in encouraging more people to come back for a third shot. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The proportion of cases attributed to the BA.5 Omicron subvariant The effectiveness of third and fourth doses in preventing severe COVID-19 and hospitalizations The uptake of third doses among Canadians The timing and availability of updated bivalent vaccines that combine the original shot with protection against Omicron.

Title: Mathematical modelling of vaccination rollout and NPIs lifting on COVID-19 transmission with VOC: a case study in Toronto, Canada - BMC Public Health
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Trusted: False

TRUE. This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses the impact of vaccination coverage, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and reopening strategies on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in Ontario. The study uses a mathematical model to simulate different scenarios and estimate the effective reproduction number (Rc) under various conditions. The results suggest that vaccinating at least 50% of adults aged 20-59 is crucial to keep the reproduction number below 1, and that focusing on immunizing age groups 20-39 and 40-59 years can reduce deaths and hospitalizations after reopening. The study also highlights the importance of maintaining NPIs, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, to prevent the spread of the virus. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: Vaccination coverage: 50% of adults aged 20-59 Effective reproduction number (Rc): below 1 Age groups: 20-39 and 40-59 years NPIs: maintaining social distancing and mask-wearing Reopening strategies: partial reopening in September, with a focus on vaccinating adults aged 20-59.

Title: 46 people in Waterloo region hospitals with COVID-19, 23 outbreaks reported by public health
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The number of people in Waterloo region hospitals with COVID-19 has risen from 15 to 46 in two weeks. The number of outbreaks in high-risk settings has increased by 8 to 23, including 13 in long-term care and retirement homes, 7 in congregate settings, and 3 in hospitals. Provincial officials have warned of a seventh wave of the virus. Wastewater data shows signals for COVID-19 appear to be plateauing, but the virus remains at an elevated level. The BA.5 variant is the dominant strain in the region and has been increasing. The lack of controls (masking, social distancing) this summer compared to previous years may contribute to a rapid increase in the spread of the variant. These values suggest an increasing trend in COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Waterloo region, which may be indicative of a larger trend in Ontario, Canada. The dominant BA.5 variant and lack of controls may contribute to a rapid increase in cases, making it important to monitor hospitalization rates and take personal precautions to prevent severe outcomes.

Title: Ontario expands eligibility for 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose, but healthy adults can wait until fall
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: Ontario is opening up eligibility for fourth COVID-19 vaccine doses to all adults aged 18 and up, but healthy adults may want to wait until the fall when a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine may be available. The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, expects a peak in COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks, with a "slower trajectory" compared to previous waves due to vaccination rates and new treatments. Ontario has seen a steep increase in COVID-19 in wastewater, percent positivity, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions in recent weeks. Moore estimates that there could be roughly 5,000 cases of COVID-19 within the community as of Wednesday. Despite the increase in cases, Ontario does not plan to reinstate public health measures lifted earlier this year. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Expected peak in COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks Slower trajectory of the current wave compared to previous waves Increase in COVID-19 in wastewater, percent positivity, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions Estimated 5,000 cases of COVID-19 within the community No plans to reinstate public health measures These values suggest that while COVID-19 cases are increasing in Ontario, the rate of increase is slower than in previous waves, and the province is not planning to reinstate public health measures. This information can be used to inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The province is expanding eligibility for fourth shots of COVID-19 vaccines to all adults, which may impact hospitalization rates. The current wave of the pandemic, fueled by the Omicron BA.5 subvariant, is expected to peak within the next two weeks, with COVID-related hospitalizations and intensive care admissions rising until then. About 70% of Ontario's intensive care unit beds are in use, but the health system's ability to provide care is not expected to be inhibited. Therapeutic COVID treatments like Paxlovid are helping to keep infected people out of the hospital system. Ontario's hospitals are currently under unprecedented strain due to staff burnout and shortages, which may impact their ability to handle an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations. These points suggest that hospitalization rates may increase in the short term due to the current wave of the pandemic, but the impact may be mitigated by the expansion of vaccine eligibility and the use of therapeutic treatments. However, the strain on the hospital system due to staff burnout and shortages may still pose a challenge.
