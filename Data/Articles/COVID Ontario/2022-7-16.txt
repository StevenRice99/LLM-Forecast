Title: Health Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for youngest kids
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Canada's federal drug regulator has approved the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for children between six months and five years old, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine available for this age group in the country. This decision expands vaccine eligibility to approximately 1.7 million additional children. Health Canada's review found that the vaccine is safe and effective in this age group, with an immune response comparable to that of 18to 25-year-olds. While the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 was lower, at around 50% for infants and 36.8% for preschoolers, it is still expected to provide protection against severe illness. Canadian health officials recommend vaccination even for children who have previously been infected with COVID-19. The vaccine dose for young children will be a quarter of the adult dose, and the recommended interval between the two doses is eight weeks, which is expected to result in a stronger immune response. No significant safety concerns were identified in the review, with side effects similar to other pediatric vaccines. However, there is still some uncertainty about rare side effects due to the vaccine's newness. The approval of the Moderna vaccine provides a way to protect young children from COVID-19 and reduce hospitalizations in this age group.

Title: How to Reduce Risk of Getting Long COVID
Publisher: Office for Science and Society
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the uncertainties surrounding long COVID and the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing it. Long COVID is defined differently by various organizations, which makes it challenging to determine its prevalence accurately. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines it as symptoms lasting four weeks post-infection, while the World Health Organization defines it as symptoms persisting for at least three months after the initial COVID infection. Recent research from Milan offers insights into the relationship between vaccination status and long COVID risk. The study analyzed healthcare workers from nine medical centers in Italy, accounting for both mild and severe cases. The findings suggest that vaccination significantly reduces the likelihood of developing long COVID, with two or three doses reducing the odds by 75% and 85%, respectively. Older individuals and those with pre-existing conditions are at a higher risk for long COVID, but younger patients can also experience persistent symptoms. Additionally, the data suggests that the risk of long COVID is not influenced by the pandemic wave or variant, indicating that newer variants do not necessarily result in a reduced likelihood of severe disease. The article emphasizes that while there are still unknowns about long COVID, vaccination is a crucial tool in preventing both infection and the potential for long-term symptoms. Wearing masks and taking other precautions also play a role in avoiding COVID infections and reducing the chances of developing long COVID.

Title: COVID-19 Antibodies From Eggs
Publisher: UC Davis
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have discovered a method to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using hen eggs. The antibodies, known as IgY, are comparable to IgG in humans and do not trigger allergic reactions when injected into the body. This discovery could lead to a low-cost and efficient way to treat and prevent COVID-19, especially in those at high risk of exposure. The team, led by Professor Rodrigo Gallardo, immunized hens with vaccines based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and found antibodies in both the blood samples and egg yolks of the hens. While antibodies from the serum were more effective, the eggs still showed promise as a potential source of COVID-19 antibodies. This development could be a significant step forward in the fight against the virus and its variants, offering a new avenue for prevention and treatment.

Title: The gender pay gap in the health and care sector a global analysis in the time of COVID-19
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The report discusses the gender pay gap in the health and care sector, which has a high potential for decent job growth and a significant female workforce. The gender pay gap in this sector is influenced by its feminization, resulting in lower earnings for both women and men. Globally, women in health and care face a 24% pay gap compared to men, even when accounting for age, education, and occupational category. The report also highlights an unexplained portion of the gender pay gap that persists over time, suggesting factors beyond individual characteristics contribute to the disparity. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on employment in the sector disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are mostly women. The report reveals variations in gender pay gaps across countries, indicating that targeted actions to close these gaps are feasible and effective. Recommendations include improving gender-disaggregated wage data collection, investing in decent jobs, promoting STEM careers for women, attracting more men to middle occupations and women to top positions, ensuring pay transparency, addressing the motherhood pay gap, and facilitating the transition to formal employment.

Title: COVID-19: B.C. report details disturbing ‘shadow pandemic’ of intimate partner violence
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses a recent survey that revealed an increase in intimate partner violence against Indigenous women and gender diverse people in British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey, conducted by the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres and Battered Women's Support Services, found that 85% of respondents experienced the onset of intimate partner violence during the pandemic, and 77% reported an increase in that violence. The report, "The Road to Safety," highlights the "shadow pandemic" of gendered colonial violence and the barriers Indigenous women and gender diverse individuals face in accessing support services. It also underscores the need for more Indigenous staff in anti-violence support and leadership roles, as well as culturally-appropriate transition homes and greater involvement of men and boys in prevention. The article includes comments from Angela Marie MacDougall of Battered Women's Support Services, who attributed the increase in violence to the isolation measures during the pandemic, and Lesley Varley of the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, who noted the fear and challenges Indigenous women face in seeking help. The province of British Columbia is reviewing the report and has committed to developing an action plan to end gender-based violence, with a recent fund of $5.3 million allocated to support Indigenous communities in expanding their safety plans.

Title: Covid-19 Shutdowns Disproportionately Harmed Women
Publisher: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Trusted: False

The article discusses the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic response strategies on women, highlighting several key areas of concern. Here are the critical facts and findings: Lockdowns at the pandemic's start saved countless lives by slowing virus transmission. However, the effects of these measures disproportionately impacted women in various domains, including economic, social, health, and security. Infectious disease outbreaks historically increase the risk of domestic violence against women, as seen in Nigeria during its COVID-19 lockdowns. The pandemic also exacerbated mental health issues, particularly for female frontline workers struggling to balance work and caregiving. Reductions in maternal and reproductive health services led to increases in unintended pregnancies and maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in countries like Brazil. School closures pushed many girls into early marriage and limited their educational and career aspirations. Women in the workforce were disproportionately affected by job losses, especially in service industries, with slower employment rebounds compared to men. Canada's Gender-Based Analysis Plus policy approach considered gender issues and increased funding for relevant support. Gender experts offer recommendations for addressing gender-based violence before, during, and after health crises, emphasizing the need for funding, support, and community coordination. Looking forward, researchers are optimistic about the increased collaboration and data sharing, aiming to influence policymakers and advocacy organizations to incorporate gender considerations in future crisis responses. These findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating gender-responsive strategies into pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery plans to mitigate the disproportionate impacts on women and promote more effective and equitable crisis management.

Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The study's ethical approval was waived by the Comité central d’éthique de la recherche du ministère de la Santé et des Services Sociaux as it relied exclusively on the secondary use of anonymous information. The study population consisted of workers from the mining industry, with individuals over 18 years old and a predominantly male demographic. The diagnostic workflow involved sampling individuals travelling to Sites A and B at a dedicated airport, with subsequent analysis of samples in a nearby laboratory. Efficacy monitoring was conducted through a second on-site laboratory at Site A, where symptomatic individuals and random samples were tested. RT-PCR testing was performed using a laboratory-developed test with a limit of detection of 2.9 copies/reaction and 100% clinical sensitivity and sensibility. This information, along with data on symptomatic individuals and random samples, can be used to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying potential outbreaks or hotspots in the mining industry and implementing preventive measures accordingly.

Publisher: UM Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
As of July 11, 2022, the University of Manitoba (UM) has announced that in-person classes and events will continue in the Fall Term starting September 7, with a reminder of existing COVID-19 health and safety protocols. The university will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and adjust protocols as needed. Here are the key points: 1. Continued Masking: Due to the widespread circulation of COVID-19 in Manitoba, the university has decided to maintain the existing masking mandate with a recommendation to use KN95 masks, although 3-ply medical masks are also acceptable. Mask distribution sites will be available on campus. Adjustments to the masking protocol include allowing instructors to remove masks while teaching if a 2-meter distance is maintained and staff to remove masks in cubicle-type workspaces with physical barriers or 2-meter separation. 2. Vaccination Encouraged: While proof of vaccination is no longer required, UM encourages everyone to stay up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations, including first and second boosters when eligible. This can help protect the UM community and reduce the risk of severe outcomes and hospitalization. 3. Stay Home When Sick: In addition to masking and vaccination, individuals are reminded to stay home if they are feeling unwell to protect others on campus. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider factors such as vaccination rates, mask adherence, and the prevalence of new variants. The university's decision to maintain masking and encourage vaccinations can help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and reduce hospitalizations. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on community adherence and the emergence of new variants. Monitoring these factors and their impact on hospitalizations will be crucial in the coming months.
