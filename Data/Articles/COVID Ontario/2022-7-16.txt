Title: What a 4th COVID shot can do for you — and what it can't
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the importance of COVID-19 shots, specifically third and fourth doses, as the virus continues to evolve. Here are the main points:
1. Third dose still essential: Experts stress that many people need a third shot of the original vaccine strain to provide significant protection against severe disease and infection with Omicron BA.1.
2. Fourth dose benefits uncertain for younger age groups: While there may be some benefit from a fourth dose for younger, healthy individuals who have already had three shots and recently contracted COVID-19, the evidence is not yet clear-cut.
3. Concerns about messaging around boosters: Some experts worry that Canadians may view boosters as "optional" with limited benefits to immunity, which could discourage people from getting a third dose.
4. Updated vaccines on the horizon: New bivalent vaccines that combine protection against the original vaccine strain and Omicron are being developed, but there are concerns about their effectiveness against newer subvariants like BA.4 and BA.5.
5. Need to adapt thinking around COVID-19 vaccines: Experts suggest that Canadians need to start thinking about what COVID-19 vaccines can do differently than before, as the virus has evolved and vaccines may not be a long-term solution for preventing transmission.
Key quotes:
"The marginal yields of a fourth dose are small at an individual level for that population segment — but they are at risk of reinfection and wider coverage may help to slow spread at a population level." (Dr. Kieran Naylor)
"Every one of these doses that goes out, public image of what vaccines can do changes with them and we need a lot of people to come back for their third dose." (Dr. Zain Chagla)

Title: Mathematical modelling of vaccination rollout and NPIs lifting on COVID-19 transmission with VOC: a case study in Toronto, Canada - BMC Public Health
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The text describes a mathematical model used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada, under various reopening scenarios and vaccination strategies. Here are the key findings:
1. Partial vs Total Reopening: A partial reopening (orange bars) is more beneficial than a total one (blue bars), with the highest increase seen when reopening to pre-pandemic levels.
2. Vaccine Efficacy: Reducing vaccine efficacy by 10% leads to a significant increase in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
3. Reduction of Time Between Doses: Shortening the time between first and second doses from 112 days to 21 days is beneficial, with a decrease in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
4. Sensitivity Analysis: The model parameters with the highest impact on cumulative cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are:
Vaccination rates of age groups 20-39 and 40-59 years
Time between doses (negative correlation)
Infection-related parameters: number of contacts and age-dependent susceptibility in ages 20-39 and 40-59 years (positive correlation)
These findings suggest that:
Targeting adults for vaccination, particularly those aged 20-39 and 40-59 years
Reducing the time between doses from 112 days to 21 days is beneficial
Focusing on reducing contacts and age-dependent susceptibility in these age groups can also help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Overall, this study provides insights into the potential effectiveness of different reopening scenarios and vaccination strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
