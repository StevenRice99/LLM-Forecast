Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted people's social circles, leading to a "friendship audit." Many have narrowed their social circles and re-evaluated their relationships, prioritizing depth over breadth. This has resulted in more meaningful and richer connections with a smaller number of friends. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of shared interests and values in forming and maintaining friendships. Some friendships have ended or been strained due to differences in beliefs and values, particularly regarding issues like masking and vaccine passports. The pandemic has also disrupted typical friendship dynamics due to lockdowns, social distancing, and the cancellation of social events. As a result, people's social circles have experienced a significant churn. However, despite the challenges, the pandemic may lead to a healthier understanding of friendship, valuing depth over superficial online connections. Moving forward, some people plan to maintain smaller social circles, focusing on quality over quantity in their relationships.

The article discusses the 2020 Pacific Dental Conference in British Columbia, which became a "superspreader" event for COVID-19, resulting in 87 documented cases and one death. Before officials realized an attendee was infected, confusion and miscommunication occurred. The conference, which had almost 15,000 attendees, took place from March 5-7, 2020, at the Vancouver Convention Centre. Despite concerns raised, the event continued, leading to significant consequences. Public health officials, including Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, were not consulted about the conference, highlighting gaps in communication and coordination. The lack of a risk assessment by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority further compounded the situation. The aftermath of the conference saw participants being advised to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, and the event's impact extended beyond the immediate attendees. The full extent of the superspreader event remains unknown, with VCH refusing to release the anonymized contact tracing report. The article also mentions other superspreader events, such as a management conference in Boston, emphasizing the global reach and consequences of such gatherings during the early stages of the pandemic. The importance of effective communication, understanding emerging science, and evidence-based decision-making in pandemic planning is highlighted in the conclusion of the article.

Title: Group of physicians combats misinformation as unproven COVID-19 treatments continue to be prescribed
Publisher: ABC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article highlights the debate between two groups of physicians in the United States regarding the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. One group, led by Dr. Stella Immanuel, promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as effective treatments for COVID-19, while denouncing mask-wearing and lockdowns. The other group, No License for Disinformation, led by Dr. Nick Sawyer, aims to hold doctors who spread dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 accountable. Dr. Sawyer believes that there has been an institutional failure by state medical boards to protect patients from misinformation. The article also includes an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who promotes ivermectin as part of a multi-drug protocol for early COVID-19 treatment. Dr. Sawyer argues that physicians like Dr. McCullough, who discourage vaccines and promote unproven treatments, are causing patients to become critically ill from COVID-19. The debate has spilled over into hospitals, with patients demanding unproven medications like ivermectin. However, Dr. McCullough defends his position, stating that he is not against all drugs and will move on to better drugs as they become available. Experts argue that the bigger problem is that doctors like Dr. McCullough promote ivermectin as a better safeguard against COVID-19 than scientifically proven vaccinations, which goes against the consensus of major medical institutions. A closer look at the studies cited by ivermectin advocates reveals that some have been retracted for flawed or fabricated data, while many solid randomized trials have shown no benefits. The article also shares the story of Phil Valentine, a conservative radio host who relied on ivermectin and refused to get vaccinated. He eventually contracted COVID-19 and died from complications, despite initially improving after taking ivermectin. His brother, Mark Valentine, still believes in the drug's effectiveness but regrets not getting vaccinated himself. Phil Valentine's experience has led to a shift in views on vaccination within his conservative community. Dr. Sawyer finds it devastating that people are unnecessarily suffering and dying from COVID-19 due to their refusal to get vaccinated. Federal data shows that unvaccinated Americans are much more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are fully vaccinated. The article emphasizes the importance of holding medical professionals accountable for spreading misinformation and encouraging vaccination to prevent unnecessary deaths.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global mental health, with a 25% increase in anxiety and depression worldwide in the first year of the pandemic. The pandemic has particularly affected young people and women and those with pre-existing physical and mental health conditions. People with mental disorders are more likely to experience severe illness and hospitalization if infected with COVID-19. The pandemic has also disrupted mental health services, leaving many people without access to necessary care. Digital interventions and support have become increasingly important, but there is still a shortage of mental health resources and investment worldwide. WHO and its member states have recognized the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and are working to provide mental health support and improve preparedness and response efforts. However, there is a need for a global step-up in investment in mental health services.

Title: Researchers detect first potential case of deer-to-human transmission of COVID-19
Publisher: Dal News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Researchers from Dalhousie University and other Canadian organizations have found a possible link between COVID-19 cases in deer and humans, suggesting the virus can transmit from wildlife to people. The paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, states that while there is evidence of COVID-19 spillover from humans to deer, clear evidence of transmission from deer to humans has not been found. However, the discovery is significant as it suggests that wild animal populations could generate new variants or harbor the current virus. The team analyzed samples from hundreds of deer killed by hunters in Ontario in 2021 and found a new and highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with 76 mutations, including some previously associated with animal hosts. They also identified an epidemiologically linked human case from the same region during the same period. This suggests the possibility of deer-to-human transmission. While the specific lineage found in deer is not currently a major concern, Dr. Finlay Maguire, a data scientist and assistant professor at Dalhousie University, highlights the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread within deer populations and transmit back to humans, which could be a difficult-to-control source of new variants. The Public Health Agency of Canada advises people who handle wildlife to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, but notes that animal-to-human transmission appears to be uncommon. This research highlights the need for greater monitoring and study of viruses in wild animal populations to better understand the impact on human health.

The article discusses a study that found a link between physical activity and reduced risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The study, led by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and researchers from Western University, analyzed data from over 65,000 adult COVID-19 patients. The patients were grouped into low, moderate, and high activity levels, with moderate and high activity levels being associated with significantly better outcomes, including lower rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, and death. This trend was true even for patients with chronic medical conditions. The study is unique in that it used data from smart devices, gym attendance records, and mass event participation rather than relying solely on self-reported survey data. The results suggest that regular physical activity, even at low to moderate intensity, can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and that promoting physical activity during pandemics should be a government policy. This study provides valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, as it identifies physical activity as a protective factor against severe disease outcomes.

Preliminary research by Canadian scientists suggests that deer may be able to transmit COVID-19 to humans, marking a potential world-first discovery. While there is already evidence of humans spreading the virus to deer and deer spreading it to other deer, this new finding indicates a possible spillover from deer to humans. This development is significant as scientists are closely monitoring the potential for wild animals to become a source of new variants and reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2. However, it's important to note that humans remain the primary source of the virus's spread. The research paper has not yet undergone peer review. The research team analyzed samples from hundreds of deer killed by hunters in southwestern Ontario in 2021 and discovered a highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with numerous mutations. Simultaneously, a similar version of the virus was identified in a human from the same region with known contact with deer. This suggests the possibility of deer-to-human transmission, but no other human cases were found. The researchers emphasize the need for better surveillance of the COVID-19 virus in humans and other organisms to fully understand the risks. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) advises that animal-to-human transmission is rare and there is no evidence of animals playing a significant role in the current spread of COVID-19. However, hunters and those handling wild deer are recommended to take precautions, including regular handwashing, wearing gloves, goggles, and masks when exposed to respiratory tissues and fluids, especially indoors. While the risk of catching the virus from deer is lower than from humans, the discovery highlights the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance to monitor for unusual variations of the virus.
