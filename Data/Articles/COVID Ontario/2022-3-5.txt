Title: Why aren't there more COVID-19 surface transmissions? The answer is mucus, study suggests
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The study suggests that proteins in mucus (glycoproteins) might bind to SARS-CoV-2 particles and prevent them from infecting human cells.
This could be an unexpected barrier to surface transmission of the virus.
Mucin can inhibit some transmission when simulated direct contact with tissue culture occurs, but its protective effect is stronger in dried droplets on surfaces.
Individual differences in mucus composition due to diet or disease may affect vulnerability to COVID-19.
