Title: How the COVID-19 pandemic has changed supply chain practices
Publisher: World Economic Forum
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global supply chain, causing delays and disruptions. Here are the key ways in which the supply chain has been affected: 1. Supply chain in the spotlight: The pandemic has brought the supply chain to the attention of the C-suite, with chief supply chain officers becoming crucial. CEOs identify supply chain issues as a significant threat to growth, even surpassing concerns about the pandemic itself. 2. Business continuity over costs: While cost reduction was a primary focus before the pandemic, the chaos caused by COVID-19 has shifted the priority to ensuring business continuity. Companies are investing in building resilience and flexibility to withstand future disruptions. 3. Evolving buyer-supplier relations: The pandemic has led to new alliances and co-development ventures between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers. There is a growing recognition that resilience requires collaboration and data sharing between buyers, suppliers, and other parties in the value chain. 4. Innovative workarounds: Companies are taking bold actions to overcome supply chain challenges. They are investing in warehouses, manufacturing containers, chartering vessels, and even acquiring e-commerce fulfillment operators to secure their supply lines. 5. Rethinking inventory strategies: The pandemic has disrupted traditional just-in-time inventory models, with companies now prioritizing having enough stock to meet customer demand. Automakers, in particular, are stockpiling key parts and securing future deliveries to avoid shortages. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the supply chain continues to face unprecedented challenges, including carrier unreliability, record-high freight rates, and low warehouse vacancies. The impact of COVID-19 has highlighted the fragility of the supply chain and the need for more resilient and flexible models.

Title: Protective gene variant against COVID-19 identified
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses research that suggests genetics may play a role in the severity of COVID-19 infections, with individuals carrying a specific DNA segment having a 20% lower risk of developing critical illness. This DNA segment is inherited from Neanderthals and is present in about half of all people outside of Africa. However, it is challenging to identify the exact protective genetic variant within this DNA segment that could be targeted for medical treatment. To overcome this challenge, researchers studied individuals with African ancestry who lack Neanderthal heritage and therefore most of this DNA segment. They found that individuals of African descent had the same protection as those of European descent, which helped pinpoint a specific gene variant (rs10774671-G) that provides protection from severe COVID-19 infection. This variant determines the length of the protein encoded by the gene OAS1, with the longer variant being more effective at breaking down the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The discovery highlights the importance of including diverse populations in genetic studies, as the protective variant was identified by studying individuals of both African and European ancestry. Understanding these genetic risk factors is key to developing new treatments for COVID-19. The specific gene variant identified in this study could be a potential target for future medical treatments to reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections.

Title: Indigenous inmates testing positive for COVID-19 at higher rates in federal prisons - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 infections among Indigenous federal inmates in Canada. As of January 10, almost 19% of active COVID-19 cases in federal penitentiaries were among Indigenous inmates, who make up only 5% of Canada's population but account for nearly one-third of the federal prison population. This discrepancy is evidence of the ongoing structural racism and "Indigenization" of Canada's correctional system, according to experts. The Congress of Aboriginal Peoples has called for the accelerated release of low-risk offenders and those on remand to limit the spread of COVID-19 in prisons, citing the high infection rate among Indigenous inmates and the prolonged nature of the pandemic. Correctional Services has implemented initiatives to stop the spread of COVID-19 and address systemic racism, including culturally appropriate approaches to Indigenous corrections and funding for reintegration support. However, with the risk of infection and new variants remaining, advocates stress the importance of releasing Indigenous inmates to protect their health and well-being.

Title: Fluvoxamine: What Prescribers and Pharmacists Need to Know
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article "Fluvoxamine: What Prescribers and Pharmacists Need to Know" by the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table provides important information for healthcare professionals regarding the use of fluvoxamine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is a summary of the article: Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) typically used to treat conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fluvoxamine has gained attention as a potential treatment for COVID-19, particularly in the early stages of the disease, to prevent hospitalization and severe outcomes. The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table recommends that fluvoxamine be considered for certain patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease and hospitalization. The recommended dose for the treatment of COVID-19 is 100 mg twice daily for adults, taken with food, for a total duration of 15 days. Fluvoxamine is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver disease, and caution should be exercised in patients with certain other medical conditions or those taking other medications that may interact with fluvoxamine. The mechanism of action of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 is believed to be related to its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, which may reduce the severity of the immune response to the virus and prevent cytokine storm. While fluvoxamine shows promise as a COVID-19 treatment, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety specifically for this indication. Prescribers and pharmacists should stay informed about the evolving evidence and guidelines regarding the use of fluvoxamine and other potential COVID-19 treatments. This article provides guidance for healthcare professionals in Ontario, Canada, regarding the appropriate use of fluvoxamine as a potential tool to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations. It emphasizes the current understanding of fluvoxamine's role, dosage, and safety considerations, while also acknowledging the need for further research.

Title: COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes (T1D) – an update
Publisher: JDRF
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: JDRF, an organization dedicated to type 1 diabetes (T1D) research, has provided an update on the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on individuals with T1D as of January 2022, during the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in Canada. While the pandemic and vaccine rollout have been ongoing for nearly two years, the current wave is causing significant concern. To minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, JDRF recommends the following precautions: Wear a well-fitting mask, preferably an N95 mask, when indoors outside your home. Double masking with a surgical mask and a cloth mask is a good alternative. Practice strict hygiene, including frequent handwashing. Ensure good ventilation indoors and avoid prolonged exposure to aerosolized particles in enclosed spaces. Minimize social interactions, avoid busy places, and maintain social distancing, including outdoors. For individuals with T1D, it is important to note that while T1D does not increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 variants, it can lead to more severe outcomes if infected. If someone with T1D tests positive for COVID-19, they should: Monitor their blood glucose levels and ketones more closely, as COVID-19 increases the risk of diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA). Maintain proper eating and drinking habits, even when sick, focusing on a balance of protein and carbohydrates. Be cautious when taking over-the-counter medications for COVID-19 symptoms, as some can affect blood glucose levels or have side effects on the kidneys and liver. Consider using a continuous glucose monitor or finger sticks to check blood glucose levels frequently. Watch for signs of DKA, such as rapid breathing and a fruity body odor, and seek immediate medical attention if suspected. The article also emphasizes the importance of seeking mental health support during this stressful time and encourages individuals with T1D to reach out to their healthcare providers or support networks for additional resources. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to consider the impact of the Omicron variant. The highly contagious nature of Omicron has led to a rapid increase in cases, and individuals with T1D are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Therefore, the number of hospitalizations may increase significantly, particularly among unvaccinated or vulnerable individuals.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
Ontario reported a record-high number of COVID-19 hospitalizations on Friday, with 2,472 people in hospital, surpassing the previous high of 2,360 during the third wave in April 2021. The number of patients in ICUs has also increased to 338, up from 205 last week. The province is expected to begin publishing data that differentiates between patients admitted due to COVID-19 and those who test positive while in hospital for other reasons. The pressure on hospitals is expected to worsen as staff absences due to COVID-19 increase and case counts continue to rise. The Ontario Hospital Association warned that the situation is dire and hospitalization rates are expected to climb. Numerous hospitals are facing staff shortages due to COVID-19 infections or exposures, leading to difficult decisions and temporary closures. The province is offering $10,000 grants to small businesses forced to close due to public health measures and has introduced a hydro relief program to provide off-peak rates for 21 days. With a positivity rate of 26.6%, Ontario's case counts are said to be a drastic undercount as testing guidelines have been limited.
