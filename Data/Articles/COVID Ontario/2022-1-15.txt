Posted: 1 day ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Dr. Peter Juni, scientific director of Ontario's expert pandemic advisory group, suggests that COVID-19 hospitalizations could peak in the next few weeks based on indicators such as: + Decreased mobility outside of homes, which is strongly correlated with the number of contacts. + Decreasing test positivity rates. Hospital occupancy needs to be monitored over the next week to confirm if the disease curve is flattening. Federal modelling predicts daily hospitalizations will surge in the coming weeks, with the current wave of COVID-19 driven by the Omicron variant expected to peak this month at between 170,000 and 300,000 actual daily cases. Ontario's top doctor, Dr. Kieran Moore, expects a difficult January followed by a "better February and March" as the current Omicron wave reaches a peak within the next few weeks. These values suggest that while there are encouraging signs, caution is still needed, and hospitalizations may peak in the next few weeks. The exact timing and magnitude of the peak are uncertain and will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of public health measures and the behavior of the Omicron variant.
