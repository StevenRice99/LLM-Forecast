Here is a summary of the article: During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is crucial to take extra precautions to protect seniors, as they are more vulnerable to the virus due to their weakened immune systems and underlying health conditions. Dr. Roger Wong, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine, offers guidance on how to protect and support older adults: Seniors should follow public health recommendations such as regular handwashing, maintaining good personal hygiene, and physical distancing by minimizing outings and avoiding peak hours for essential tasks like grocery shopping. They can also utilize delivery services or seek support from programs like Safe Seniors, Strong Communities, which connects seniors with volunteers for non-medical essentials. Family and caregivers play a vital role in protecting seniors by minimizing in-person visits and practicing good hygiene if visits are essential. They can also support seniors by running errands, providing necessities, and using technology to stay connected while preventing social isolation. Regarding medical appointments, seniors should consult their healthcare providers to assess if rescheduling or virtual appointments are feasible. While seniors often provide valuable support to families, including babysitting, they should consider limiting their exposure to children during the outbreak, as asymptomatic children can still spread the virus. Additionally, here are some key facts to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially regarding seniors: Seniors, particularly those over 65, are at increased risk of severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19 due to their higher likelihood of having underlying medical conditions. The presence of underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system, further increases the risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes in seniors. The transmission of COVID-19 to seniors can occur through various means, including outings to public places, community interactions, and visits from loved ones, even if they are asymptomatic. The impact of COVID-19 on seniors can be severe, leading to respiratory complications, organ failure, and, in some cases, death. The availability and utilization of preventive measures, such as vaccination and booster shots, can significantly influence hospitalization rates among seniors. By considering these factors and following the advice of public health officials and medical experts, we can better protect seniors from the impacts of COVID-19 and help forecast and manage hospitalization rates.

The article describes the process of using RT-PCR to detect the COVID-19 virus in a sample and provides some insights that can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. Here's a summary: RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus in a person's body. The process starts by collecting samples from the parts of the body where the virus gathers, such as the nose or throat. The sample then undergoes treatment with chemical solutions to extract only the RNA present, which includes the person's genetic material and potentially the virus's RNA. The extracted RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA using a specific enzyme. Scientists add short fragments of DNA that are complementary to specific parts of the viral DNA. These fragments attach to the target sections of the viral DNA, and some are used for building and amplifying the DNA strands. The mixture is then placed in an RT-PCR machine, which cycles through temperatures to heat and cool the mixture. This triggers chemical reactions that create new, identical copies of the target sections of viral DNA. Each cycle doubles the number of copies, and a standard real-time RT-PCR setup typically goes through 35 cycles, resulting in around 35 billion new copies of the viral DNA sections. Marker labels are used during the process, which attach to the newly built DNA strands and release a fluorescent dye. The machine's computer measures the fluorescence and presents the data in real time. Scientists can confirm the presence of the virus when a certain level of fluorescence is surpassed. Additionally, the number of cycles it takes to reach this level indicates the severity of the infection—fewer cycles indicate a more severe viral load. This technique is highly sensitive and specific for detecting the COVID-19 virus and can help in forecasting hospitalizations. A rapid increase in confirmed cases, especially with severe infections, could indicate a potential surge in hospitalizations. This information can help healthcare facilities prepare their resources and plan accordingly.

Here is a summary of the article: To support people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Province of British Columbia is introducing several measures to help renters and landlords during the pandemic. These measures include: A new temporary rental supplement of up to $500 per month, paid directly to landlords, for households facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. Halting evictions by preventing landlords from issuing new notices to end tenancy, except in extreme cases to protect health and safety or prevent property damage. Freezing rent increases during the state of emergency. Restricting landlords from accessing rental units without tenant consent, except in cases of health, safety, or property damage concerns. Allowing landlords to restrict the use of common areas to prevent COVID-19 transmission. These measures aim to provide financial relief and security for renters, ensure landlords continue to receive rental income, and ultimately keep people housed and protect their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. As for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide any specific data or models that could be used for such predictions. However, the measures introduced by the Province are likely to have a positive impact on hospitalizations by reducing financial stress, providing stability for individuals and families, and encouraging people to stay at home, which could help slow the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Here is a summary of the article: A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17, 2020, reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain active and infectious on various surfaces for extended periods. Led by Dr. Vincent Munster, the research team found that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in aerosols for up to three hours and remain on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days. The virus was also found to be infectious on cardboard for 24 hours and on copper for four hours. These findings emphasize the importance of hand hygiene and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing are believed to be the primary mode of transmission, the study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can also be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching one's face. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces is similar to that of the previous SARS-CoV-1 virus, yet COVID-19 has resulted in a much larger outbreak. This indicates that the difference in epidemiology may be due to factors such as asymptomatic transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus and reduce hospitalizations, public health measures such as hand washing, disinfecting surfaces, avoiding touching the face, and maintaining social distance from those who are sick are crucial. These findings will also inform future epidemiological investigations to better understand the person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2.
