Title: COVID-19, Hygiene Theatre, Masks, and Lockdowns: “Solid Science” or Science Veneer?
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The debate around the effectiveness of COVID-19 policies and whether they were based on scientific evidence is ongoing, even two and a half years into the pandemic. This discussion is crucial as it will shape our response to future pandemics and impact the public's trust in government recommendations. One contentious issue is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the virus's spread and reduce infection risk. These measures included enhanced hygiene, social distancing, masks, and restrictions on gatherings. The effectiveness of these NPIs in curbing COVID-19 hospitalizations is a key factor in evaluating their success. Here are some important facts and considerations to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in relation to NPIs: 1. NPIs aimed at physical separation: Social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large gatherings were expected to reduce transmission and hospitalizations. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on compliance and consistent implementation, which varies across populations. 2. Vaccine uptake: The number of vaccinated individuals in a population impacts hospitalization rates. High vaccination coverage can reduce the severity of infections and lower the overall hospitalization burden. 3. Virus variants: New variants can exhibit increased transmissibility and immune escape, leading to higher infection rates and hospitalizations, especially in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated populations. 4. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of healthcare systems to handle surges in hospitalizations varies across regions. Limited resources, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and medical staff can affect hospitalization rates and outcomes. 5. Regional differences: COVID-19's impact varies by region due to factors like population density, age demographics, and underlying health conditions. These factors influence hospitalization rates and should be considered when forecasting. 6. Efficacy of NPIs: The effectiveness of NPIs in reducing hospitalizations should be evaluated based on scientific studies and data. Modeling and analysis can help forecast the impact of specific NPIs on hospitalization rates. 7. Public compliance: The success of NPIs relies on public adherence to guidelines. Fatigue with restrictions, skepticism, and misinformation can impact compliance, affecting hospitalization rates. 8. Timing of interventions: The timing of NPI implementation is crucial. Delayed responses can lead to exponential growth in cases and hospitalizations, while early and decisive actions can flatten the curve. 9. Combination of measures: NPIs are often most effective when combined. Implementing multiple strategies simultaneously, such as masking and social distancing, can have a greater impact on reducing hospitalizations. 10. Surveillance and monitoring: Robust surveillance systems that track infections, hospitalizations, and variant spread are essential for forecasting. This data informs the effectiveness of NPIs and helps identify areas at risk of increased hospitalizations. By considering these factors and continuously evaluating the scientific evidence, public health officials can make informed decisions about NPIs and forecast COVID-19 hospitalization trends. This ongoing assessment is crucial for adapting strategies and ensuring an effective response to future waves or pandemics.

Posted: 1 day ago
The article outlines a Communicable Disease Prevention Framework to prevent the spread of illnesses such as influenza and COVID-19 in academic settings. It emphasizes the role of individuals, Public Health, and UBC in implementing measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Key points include: Daily health checks and staying home when sick are important to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and to give individuals time to rest and recover. Behavioral considerations such as handwashing, respiratory etiquette, and wearing masks in indoor public spaces are recommended, with respect for individual choices. Vaccines are essential to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and individuals are encouraged to stay up-to-date on their vaccinations. Cleaning shared areas and maintaining functioning HVAC systems are important measures to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases. Spending time outdoors reduces the risk of respiratory illness transmission by allowing for better ventilation and physical distancing. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered: Vaccination rates: Higher vaccination rates are likely to reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections and lower hospitalization rates. Variants: The emergence of new variants can impact the severity of infections and the effectiveness of vaccines, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of the healthcare system to manage COVID-19 cases, including ICU bed availability and staffing levels, will influence hospitalization rates. Adherence to preventive measures: The effectiveness of the above-mentioned preventive measures, such as masking and physical distancing, will impact hospitalization rates. Wastewater surveillance: Monitoring wastewater for the presence of COVID-19 can provide early warning signs of increasing infection rates and help forecast hospitalizations. By considering these factors and utilizing data from various sources, public health officials can make informed predictions about COVID-19 hospitalization rates and implement appropriate measures to manage the impact on healthcare systems.

Title: Sense of mastery: A psychological resource during the COVID-19 pandemic (infographic)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the concept of sense of mastery, which is the perception that one has control over the forces influencing their life. It is considered a determinant of positive mental health by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic had varying impacts on different populations in Canada, with adults having a high sense of mastery being 50% less likely to report worse mental health during the pandemic compared to those with lower mastery. High sense of mastery was more common among men, non-immigrants, high-income households, adults aged 35 years and older, and non-racialized individuals. The disparities in sense of mastery across different populations may stem from differences in life circumstances and socioeconomic inequalities. The article suggests that interventions to strengthen coping skills and reduce mental health disparities could be informed by surveillance data on sense of mastery. It also highlights the availability of mental health resources for those in need. The data used in the article were collected by Statistics Canada through surveys conducted in late 2020 and early 2021 among adults in Canada.

Title: 'COVID is making a comeback' in Quebec, says MUHC specialist
Publisher: CTV News Montreal
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
COVID-19 cases are rising again in Quebec, with 127,000 confirmed cases in the first week of September and an estimated 18,000-29,000 new cases daily. Hospitalizations have also doubled, indicating a resurgence of the virus. While the severity of the disease has decreased since the start of the pandemic, people are still getting sick and hospitalizations may increase if cases continue to rise. The new EG.5.1 variant is more transmissible and can evade immunity from previous infections or vaccinations before May or June. Health Canada has approved updated vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that target the XBB.1.5 variant, which is effective against EG.5.1 and other related variants. Wearing masks in public settings, especially around sick people or in hospitals, is recommended to prevent the spread and protect vulnerable individuals. The current situation in Quebec highlights the need for continued vigilance and public health measures to manage COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: 'COVID was never gone': As cases rise in B.C., so do worries about normalizing the coronavirus
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Candace Latham, a Vancouver mother with an immunocompromised 15-year-old son, shares her concerns about the rise in COVID-19 cases in British Columbia and the apparent relaxation of health measures by the public. New data from the BCCDC reveals that COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all increased between August 20 and September 16. Dr. Brian Conway, an infectious disease specialist, attributes this rise to people becoming less vigilant and "powering through" respiratory illnesses. He emphasizes the importance of staying home when sick, even without a positive COVID test. The current BCCDC guidance for schools, which allows sick students to attend and doesn't require masks, is criticized by Latham and Dr. Laura Sauve, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, as insufficient. B.C.'s human rights commissioner, Kasari Govender, also emphasizes the need for mask mandates in healthcare settings to protect vulnerable individuals. Infectious disease experts recommend the updated COVID-19 vaccine for added protection. BC's Ministry of Health plans to release information on respiratory virus season preparations soon.

Title: Is Vomiting a Symptom of COVID-19?
Publisher: Health.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have been linked to COVID-19. While respiratory symptoms are more common, GI issues have been reported in a significant number of COVID-19 cases. In different studies, about 40% and 27% of COVID-19 patients experienced GI symptoms, with vomiting being the most common. This trend was also observed in a U.S. study, where about 16% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experienced vomiting. GI symptoms can persist even after recovery from COVID-19, with 16-40% of people experiencing long-term GI issues. The presence of ACE2, a protein affected by the coronavirus, in the gastrointestinal tract may explain this connection. It's important to note that nausea and vomiting can also be side effects of COVID-19 treatments or related to stress and anxiety associated with the disease. Other health conditions, such as food allergies, migraines, or stomach infections, can also cause these symptoms. The only way to confirm if nausea and vomiting are due to COVID-19 is through testing. To determine the underlying cause of GI symptoms, healthcare providers may perform a physical exam, consider medical history, and conduct diagnostic tests. If you experience severe or persistent nausea and vomiting, it is crucial to seek medical attention, especially if accompanied by other COVID-19 warning signs like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or confusion.
