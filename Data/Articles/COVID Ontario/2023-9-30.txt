Title: Researchers are still untangling the risks of catching COVID over and over
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the ongoing impact of COVID-19, specifically long COVID (Post-COVID Conditions), and how it has affected individuals and society. The key points are:
1. Long COVID is real: Despite initial estimates, many scientists agree that there were likely lower rates of lasting health impacts than previously thought.
2. Vaccination reduces risk: Studies suggest that vaccination or prior COVID infection can reduce the risk of long COVID.
3. Definition unclear: The definition and scope of long COVID are still being refined, with symptoms ranging from temporary changes to debilitating, persistent health impacts.
4. Rates lower than expected: Studies have found rates of long COVID to be lower than initially estimated, with one study suggesting 1.3% of individuals infected by an early strain of SARS-CoV-2 were later diagnosed with long COVID.
5. Risk not eliminated: Even with vaccination and precautions, the risk of long COVID is still present, particularly for those with severe disease or underlying health conditions.
6. Psychological impact: The article highlights the emotional toll of living with long COVID, citing examples of healthcare workers whose lives have been "destroyed" by their illness.
The experts interviewed in the article offer a nuanced view on how to approach COVID-19 in the post-pandemic era:
Angela Rasmussen emphasizes that while vaccination and precautions can reduce individual risk, they don't eliminate it entirely.
Dr. Saxinger notes that there's no need to panic, but rather acknowledge the consequences of COVID-19 for many people.
The article concludes by highlighting the reality that SARS-CoV-2 is a permanent part of the viral landscape, and that we must adapt to living with this virus in the long term.
Key takeaways:
COVID-19 still has lasting health impacts (long COVID) for some individuals.
Vaccination and precautions can reduce individual risk but don't eliminate it entirely.
The definition and scope of long COVID are still being refined.
Basic precautions like vaccination, mask-wearing, and better air cleaning can help mitigate individual risk.
We must adapt to living with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-pandemic era.

Relevant.
Dr. Steve Findall, an Ontario emergency room doctor, warns of a COVID-19 surge in Ontario with rising test positivity rates.
He advises hospital mask mandates to protect vulnerable patients.

Title: Characteristics of patients with repeat hospitalizations for substance-related harms in Canada
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
This report appears to be from a Canadian health organization, likely based on data from the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), which contains information about hospital discharges. Here's a summary of what I can infer:
Report Content: 
The report provides an analysis of substance-related poisonings and disorders in Canada. It focuses on assigned sex at birth (male or female) and does not include individuals who are recorded as "other" sex or unknown.
Methodology: 
The analysis uses the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canadian Adaptation (ICD-10-CA) codes to identify substance-related poisonings and disorders. The report includes a list of ICD-10-CA codes used for this purpose (Appendix A).
Data Limitations: 
The report notes several limitations:
1. It only reports on assigned sex at birth, not gender identity.
2. It excludes individuals who are recorded as "other" sex or unknown due to low numbers.
3. The data do not include the province of Quebec.
Key Findings: 
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific findings in the report that I can summarize for you. The text appears to be primarily concerned with providing context and explaining the methodology used.
Appendices: 
The report includes three appendices:
1. Appendix A lists the ICD-10-CA codes used to identify substance-related poisonings.
2. Appendix B provides a list of ICD-10-CA codes for substance-related disorders, including various categories (e.g., medical condition, abuse).
3. There is an empty appendix C.
Please let me know if you have any specific questions about this report or would like me to clarify anything!
