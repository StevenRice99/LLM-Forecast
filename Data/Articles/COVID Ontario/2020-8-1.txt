Title: How does COVID-19 spread? U of T infectious disease expert breaks down the latest research
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: As the province gradually reopens its economy, it is important to understand how COVID-19 spreads to implement effective preventive measures. The primary mode of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is through respiratory droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. These droplets usually land within a close distance, which is why physical distancing of two meters and wearing non-medical masks are recommended. However, there has been research suggesting that the virus can also be present in smaller, more buoyant particles called aerosols, which can linger in the air for longer and travel farther. While this route of transmission is not believed to be the primary driver of COVID-19 infections, improving ventilation systems in buildings is still important to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission. Regarding surface transmission, while early research suggested the virus could survive on surfaces for up to six days, it is now understood that the risk of contracting COVID-19 from surfaces is lower than initially thought. Nevertheless, regular cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, especially in public spaces, remain important preventive measures. The public health measures implemented, such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, and handwashing, have been effective in controlling the spread of the virus. As the province reopens, it is crucial to maintain these measures to continue driving down case counts. Additionally, improving ventilation systems, especially in older buildings, is recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission. Overall, a combination of these preventive strategies will help protect individuals and communities from COVID-19 as society gradually returns to normal functioning.

Publisher: EY
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and confidence, with a focus on Canada. Here's a summary: COVID-19 has significantly altered people's habits, including work, social, and purchasing behaviors. The Conference Board of Canada reported a significant drop in the Index of Consumer Confidence in Canada in April 2020, indicating lowered consumer confidence due to the pandemic and isolation measures. EY (Ernst & Young) has created the EY Future Consumer Index to help businesses understand the changing consumer behaviors and preferences, and to guide their response to these changes. The index identifies four emerging consumer segments and provides insights into how brands should adapt to meet their expectations. The report is based on a survey of nearly 5,000 individuals in five countries, including Canada, conducted in April 2020, providing insights into consumer sentiment and behavior during the early months of the pandemic. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors need to be considered: Impact of changing consumer behavior: The changes in consumer behavior, such as increased remote work and online purchasing, can affect hospitalization rates. For example, with more people staying at home, there may be a decrease in certain types of accidents and injuries typically associated with commuting or outdoor activities. Healthcare system capacity: The capacity and resilience of healthcare systems play a crucial role in managing the pandemic. Regions with limited healthcare resources may struggle to handle a surge in cases, potentially leading to higher hospitalization rates. Adherence to public health measures: The effectiveness of public health measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccination campaigns will influence hospitalization rates. Strict adherence to these measures can help reduce the spread of the virus and lower the number of severe cases that require hospitalization. Variants of the virus: The emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus can impact hospitalization rates. Some variants may be more transmissible or cause more severe illness, leading to an increase in hospitalizations. Vaccination rates: The pace and coverage of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns will significantly influence hospitalization forecasts. Higher vaccination rates can reduce the risk of severe illness and lower the overall demand for hospital beds. Overall, the impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior and confidence is complex and dynamic. Businesses need to adapt to these changing behaviors and preferences, and understanding these shifts can also help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, along with considering healthcare system capacity, public health measures, and the impact of virus variants.

Title: Is DNA key to whether you get COVID-19?
Publisher: Queen's University
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
There is emerging evidence that suggests men may be more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 than women, which has sparked an international effort to identify the genetic factors that influence vulnerability and resistance to the virus. The Canadian government, in collaboration with the United Kingdom and the United States, aims to contribute 10,000 fully decoded genomes of COVID-19 patients to this effort, which is part of a larger global initiative to collect 100,000 genomes. Dr. David Maslove, a Clinician Scientist with the Department of Medicine and Critical Care Program at Queen's University, is coordinating the Canadian arm of the project. Previous studies have shown that susceptibility to infections can be partially influenced by genetics, and that the likelihood of dying from an infection is more heritable than dying from cancer. Early studies on COVID-19 have identified risk factors such as age, hypertension, and diabetes, but there are additional factors that influence the severity of the illness. There is also a higher mortality rate among men, which may be partially explained by genetic differences in sex chromosomes. The GenOMICC study aims to identify the genetic determinants of COVID-19 by sequencing the genomes of a large number of patients. Researchers hope that by identifying specific genes and molecular pathways, they can gain insights into how the coronavirus infects cells and how the body responds, leading to more effective treatments. Canada is playing a key role in this international initiative due to its expertise in genomics and its strong track record in collaborative critical care research.

Title: The road to COVID-19 testing: The role of a Canadian biotech pioneer
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which is used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, was innovated by the first biotech company, Cetus. The company was co-founded by Canadian-born and educated Ron Cape, who obtained his PhD at McGill in 1967. The PCR test is based on amplifying DNA through varying temperatures and repeated cycles, which was discovered by Cetus scientist Kary Mullis who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1993. The testing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 involves taking a deep nasal swab from a patient and using another enzyme called reverse transcriptase to copy the virus's RNA into DNA for PCR amplification. Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg set up the SARS-CoV-2 test based on data distributed by the World Health Organization in January 2020. However, there is still a lack of coherence and standardization in tests and the communication of results, which should be addressed to improve COVID-19 preparedness and response. Genome Canada's testing expertise through its six genome centers could help fill this gap and improve Canada's testing capabilities for the expected next surge of SARS-CoV-2 or the next pandemic.

Here is a summary of the article: As Canadian provinces plan for the reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, two rapid evidence reviews by the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) provide important insights. The first review found that children under 10 are unlikely to be a significant source of COVID-19 transmission in schools and daycare centers. Transmission among infected children was mainly traced back to community settings or adults, rather than other children in schools or daycares. This suggests that adults are more likely to be the primary transmitters of the virus. The second review focused on the impact of the pandemic on families and found that they are experiencing increased stress, with negative mental health outcomes, particularly for female caregivers and children. The pandemic has also widened gender gaps in employment, with women experiencing more job losses and reduced hours compared to men. These reviews can help inform public health decisions and policies regarding school reopenings and support for families during the pandemic.
