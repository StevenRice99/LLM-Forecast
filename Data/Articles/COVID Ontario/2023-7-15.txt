Title: Low muscle mass could make people more vulnerable to COVID, study suggests
Publisher: University of Alberta
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Researchers from the University of Alberta have found that body composition, specifically muscle mass and body fat levels, plays a significant role in the prognosis and recovery of COVID-19 patients. The analysis of 62 studies involving 1.3 million COVID-19 patients revealed that those with low muscle mass and high visceral fat at the time of diagnosis were more likely to develop complications and have poorer outcomes, including a higher risk of death. This information can help healthcare providers better manage and treat COVID-19 patients, especially those with long COVID, by considering body composition assessments during hospital admission to minimize the impact of the disease and improve patient outcomes.

Title: B.C. preparing for fall rollout of new Omicron COVID-19 vaccine
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: British Columbia's Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, is encouraging residents to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that it should be viewed as an annual immunization similar to the flu shot. The new vaccine formulation is tailored to the Omicron variant, which has been dominant for nearly two years and remains stable. This updated vaccine builds on previous immunity and is expected to offer better protection against circulating strains. National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) also recommends that Canadians get the updated vaccine if it has been six months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection. The focus is particularly on high-risk groups, including those aged 65 and up, long-term care residents, pregnant people, and individuals with underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 hospitalizations in B.C. are at their lowest since July 2021, but there are concerns about overcoming COVID-fatigue and ensuring a smooth vaccine rollout. Dr. Anna Wolak emphasizes the need for better communication and a seamless vaccination process. Dr. Henry predicts a likely fall "surge" of COVID-19 cases, underscoring the importance of the updated vaccine.

Title: Should You Retest After Testing Positive for COVID-19?
Publisher: Health.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article's key points and guidelines for individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19: Isolation: Isolate yourself for five days, regardless of vaccination status or symptom severity. Wear a well-fitted mask if you must be around others. Symptoms: Monitor for symptoms such as cough, difficulty breathing, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal issues, headache, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, runny nose, and sore throat. If symptoms develop after testing positive, restart the five-day isolation period. End of Isolation: Isolation can be ended after five days if symptoms improve and there is no fever for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication. However, symptoms like loss of taste or smell may persist for months, and isolation can still be ended if other symptoms improve. Retesting: Retesting is optional and not required by the CDC if symptoms subside. However, individuals with severe illness or weak immune systems should consult healthcare providers for a testing plan. CDC Guidelines: According to the CDC, consider using antigen tests, and with two consecutive negative tests 48 hours apart, mask requirements can be lifted before day 10. Otherwise, continue wearing a mask until day 10. Expert Opinions: Some experts disagree with the CDC guidelines, stating that a negative test should be required to end isolation. They cite that a significant portion of people may still be infectious after five days, potentially spreading the virus. Reinfection: COVID-19 reinfection can occur within 90 days of the initial infection. Consult a healthcare provider if new symptoms develop during this period, and consider retesting if other causes are ruled out. Employer Requirements: Employers should not mandate negative tests after the five-day isolation period but should instead focus on expanding free testing sites. Confirming Results: Antigen tests may produce false negatives, and PCR tests may detect dead virus fragments even after an individual is no longer infectious. Retesting is recommended to confirm a negative test if there has been close contact with an infected person or frequent interaction with others. Bottom Line: Follow CDC guidelines, consult healthcare providers, and exercise caution by wearing protective masks like N95 respirators when around others. These guidelines aim to balance public health needs with practical considerations and individual circumstances. While the situation surrounding COVID-19 evolves, staying informed through reliable sources like the CDC, WHO, and local health departments is essential.

Title: The changing landscape of cyber security following the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated societal changes that significantly impacted Canadian businesses, with many embracing digital technologies and online sales. This shift has also exposed businesses to new risks, particularly in cyber security. The article examines how businesses are adapting to these threats using data from the Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime (CSCSC). Key findings include: A third of Canadian businesses made sales online in 2021, a rise from 25% in 2019. 26% of businesses had written cyber security policies in 2021, up from 22% in 2019. Cyber security spending has increased significantly, with average spending on prevention and detection rising by 46% from 2019 to 2021. Despite growing awareness, the proportion of businesses with dedicated cyber security staff remained unchanged, and only a slight increase in businesses providing formal cyber security training was observed. 18% of businesses reported cyber security incidents in 2021, a slight decrease from 21% in 2019. However, the financial consequences worsened, with average recovery costs rising to $19,000 in 2021 from $11,000 in 2019. Identity theft incidents increased, while hacking and exploiting vulnerabilities decreased. Ransomware, measured separately for the first time, impacted 11% of affected businesses. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, various factors are considered, including vaccination rates, the severity of virus strains, and adherence to public health measures. While cyber security and online sales may impact data collection and modeling, the article does not provide direct insights into COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts.

Title: Get another COVID-19 booster in the fall, Canada's immunization panel recommends
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada has recommended that Canadians receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster in the fall, especially if it has been six months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection. This recommendation is for a booster dose of a vaccine formulation updated to target more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are expected to provide a better immune response. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are working to get their new formulations approved by Health Canada. NACI strongly recommends the primary two-dose series of an mRNA vaccine for anyone five years and older who hasn't yet been vaccinated. They also suggest children six months to five years old get vaccinated. The existing bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccines can be used for initial vaccination. Fall immunization is particularly important for vulnerable groups, including older adults, residents of long-term care homes, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant individuals, and individuals from Indigenous and racialized communities. NACI also recommends the Novavax vaccine as a booster for adults unwilling or unable to receive an mRNA vaccine.

The article highlights a potential complication of COVID-19 where abnormal blood clots form in small blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage, heart attack, and stroke. This complication is thought to be triggered by the high levels of inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations may require considering this aspect, as the inflammation can lead to severe disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children and teens, particularly affecting the heart. Therefore, monitoring and managing inflammation, especially in high-risk groups, could be crucial in reducing hospitalizations and severe outcomes.

Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Wastewater surveillance has been a crucial tool in providing health officials with insights into the prevalence of diseases like COVID-19 during pandemic peaks. While most wastewater sites in Canada are reporting decreasing or stable levels of COVID-19, researchers emphasize the need to continue this surveillance to prepare for future pandemics. Surveillance helps predict disease trends, support public health policy decisions, and identify new virus strains. Experts like Dr. Guillaume Poliquin and Eric Arts stress the importance of sustaining and expanding wastewater surveillance systems to detect new pathogens and infectious strains. The federal government monitors wastewater for various diseases and researchers advocate for a national strategy to consolidate data and improve public health insights. Border surveillance at key locations like the Windsor-Detroit border is highlighted as a top priority to monitor diseases entering the country. A cross-border surveillance program pitch by the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research and other universities is expected to be submitted by September for government decision. The cost-effectiveness of wastewater surveillance is noted, with individual PCR tests costing more than wastewater sample tests. This article highlights the ongoing efforts and importance of wastewater surveillance in Canada, providing valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and preparing for future health threats.
