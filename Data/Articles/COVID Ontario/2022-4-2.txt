Title: Canada’s hospital capacity crisis will remain long after the pandemic is over
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses various health care funding models in Canada and the US, highlighting their potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. The author explores the concept of bundled payments, where hospitals receive a single payment for all the care a patient receives within a specific period. This approach aims to incentivize better care coordination among healthcare providers.
The article quotes Kevin Smith, President of the University Health Network in Toronto, who has implemented small-scale versions of bundled payments at UHN and St. Joseph's Health System in Hamilton. Smith notes that this model allows money to follow patient needs, ensuring they receive the best possible care regardless of where it takes place.
Jason Sutherland, a professor at the University of British Columbia and expert on healthcare funding, is also featured. He advocates for a funding model that ties hospital budgets to patient outcomes, citing successful examples in the US through Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).
The article highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare, with experts emphasizing the need to track performance indicators and use evidence-based practices. Sutherland's program in Vancouver, which monitors patient outcomes after surgery, is cited as an example.
Another expert, Elyse Berger Pelletier, a Quebec ER physician, shares her experience leading an initiative to modernize emergency rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her team used data analysis to identify potential areas for improvement and made adjustments to free up hospital capacity.
The article concludes by mentioning Dr. Vivek Sharma, who was scheduled to be interviewed but had contracted COVID-19. This serves as a reminder of the challenges healthcare providers face in managing patient care during a pandemic.
