Title: When COVID-19 Symptoms Won't Go Away: The Long Road to Recovery
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Yale New Haven Hospital and Yale Medicine have launched a program to aid patients suffering from long-term effects of COVID-19. The program is primarily pulmonary-focused but also includes caregivers from various specialties, such as physical therapy, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Interestingly, the majority of patients in the program were never hospitalized for COVID-19 and only experienced mild to moderate symptoms. However, these patients still suffer from lingering issues such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased tolerance for normal activities. The program aims to improve patients' functionality and prevent further deconditioning through pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes exercise training and breathing techniques. The recovery process is highly individualized, and the typical two-week recovery period does not apply to many patients with long-term symptoms. The program also addresses the mental health aspect of recovery, providing support and maintaining a sense of hope for patients dealing with protracted symptoms. The terms "long haulers" and "long-termers" have emerged to describe these patients, but the implications of permanent symptoms are not always accurate or helpful. The Yale team plans to follow patients' progress for at least a year to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Title: How will COVID-19 change us as a global society? Will equity lose ground?
Publisher: Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada
Trusted: False

The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on global society, and one consequence has been an increase in gender-based violence (GBV) due to lockdown measures. Professor Nazilla Khanlou from the Faculty of Health highlights this issue, terming it a "syndemic" a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic with the concurrent pandemics of racism and GBV. This syndemic disproportionately affects racialized women, who face synergistic health disadvantages. In response, Khanlou and her team are working on a knowledge synthesis project funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to inform mental health support for these at-risk women. Their work includes producing knowledge outputs such as an Information Sheet that addresses risk factors, systemic challenges, and suggestions for service providers. To answer your question about forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are a few key factors to consider: 1. Vaccination Rates: The availability and uptake of vaccines significantly impact hospitalization rates. As more people get vaccinated, the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization decreases. 2. Variants of Concern: The emergence of new variants can influence the severity of cases and transmissibility. Variants that evade immune responses or are more contagious can lead to increased hospitalizations. 3. Healthcare System Capacity: The ability of healthcare systems to handle surges in cases is crucial. If a region's healthcare infrastructure is overwhelmed, it can lead to higher hospitalization rates and worse outcomes. 4. Public Health Measures: The effectiveness of public health measures, such as social distancing, mask mandates, and testing/tracing strategies, plays a significant role in curbing the spread and reducing hospitalizations. 5. Community Behavior: The adherence to public health guidelines and the collective behavior of communities can influence transmission rates and, subsequently, hospitalization numbers. By monitoring these factors and analyzing data on case numbers, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and local healthcare capacity, public health officials can make informed predictions about COVID-19 hospitalization trends. This information is crucial for allocating resources, planning healthcare responses, and implementing targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on communities.

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Queen's University has released a COVID-19 assessment tool as an addition to its mobile safety app, SeQure, to enhance the safety of its campus community. The app asks users about symptoms, travel history, and possible contact with positive COVID-19 cases. Based on the responses, it indicates if it is safe for the user to proceed with their visit to the campus. The app also collects information on the user's planned building visits and contact number to facilitate contact tracing if needed. The university strongly recommends that all individuals on campus use the SeQure app to help mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19. This tool is part of Queen's larger return-to-campus plan, which includes remote learning, reduced residence capacity, mandatory masks, physical distancing, and an on-campus COVID-19 testing center. The app can be downloaded on iOS or Android devices through the Campus Security website or app stores. By using the SeQure app and following the university's safety protocols, Queen's University aims to ensure a gradual and safe return to normal operations while prioritizing the health and well-being of its community.

Title: Black Canadians hit hard by COVID-19, new national study shows
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article presents a study that reveals COVID-19's disproportionate impact on Black Canadians' health and finances. Here is a summary, along with essential details for forecasting hospitalizations: Asli Farah, an immigrant to Canada, shared her experience with COVID-19, highlighting the challenges of language barriers and the difficulty in accessing information and medical help during self-isolation. A study by the African Canadian Civic Engagement Council and Innovative Research Group found that Black Canadians are more likely than other Canadians to seek treatment and experience layoffs due to COVID-19. Black Canadians are nearly three times more likely to know someone who has died from the virus and are more likely to be infected or hospitalized themselves. The research also showed that Black communities are experiencing higher rates of layoffs, reduced work hours, and household income losses, with men over 45 being the hardest hit. Black Canadians reported feeling at higher risk of infection due to their daily routines and jobs requiring face-to-face interaction or reliance on public transit. Among commuters, Black Canadians are twice as likely to feel unsafe during their commute and are more likely to experience symptoms or seek medical treatment. The study's authors emphasize the need for more data collection and support for Black-led community groups, which play a crucial role in creating awareness and assisting immigrants during the pandemic. The survey was conducted online with a representative sample of 2,322 Canadians, including 400 Black Canadians, and has a margin of error of approximately +/-3 percentage points for the general population and +/-5 for the Black Canadian sample. This data provides valuable insights into the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Canadians and can help forecast hospitalizations by identifying high-risk groups and understanding the factors contributing to increased infection rates and hospitalizations within this community.

Title: Overtime work among professional nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of nurses in Canada, specifically focusing on overtime work. The key findings are as follows: About 26% of nurses worked overtime in April and May 2020, which remained constant from 2019 despite a decline in other occupations. Nurses who worked overtime significantly increased their hours, with weekly overtime hours increasing by 3-4 hours on average in April and May 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in overtime hours was more pronounced in Quebec and Ontario, which had the largest number of COVID-19 cases during those months. Older nurses (aged 35 and above) who worked overtime experienced a doubling of their average weekly overtime hours in May 2020 compared to May 2019. The increased workload has implications for the well-being of nurses, as overtime work has been linked to higher work stress and negative health outcomes. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations based on these findings, it is important to consider the following: The increased demand for nursing work and the subsequent increase in overtime hours suggest that hospitalizations may have been higher during the studied period (April and May 2020) compared to the same months in 2019. The provinces with the largest increases in overtime hours (Quebec and Ontario) were also the ones with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, indicating a potential correlation between case numbers and hospitalization rates. The use of more experienced nurses and the reintegration of retired nurses during the pandemic may have helped manage the increased demand for healthcare services. Monitoring and tracking the workload and well-being of nurses over time can help identify areas of concern and inform strategies to manage healthcare demands more effectively.

The University of Toronto has implemented several COVID-19 procedures and protocols to ensure a safe return to campus for students, faculty, and staff in the fall. These measures focus on mitigating the spread of the virus and include the following: Consulting with public health authorities and experts to create effective protocols. Conducting risk assessments and providing self-isolation spaces for students in residence. Contact tracing and disinfecting physical spaces as needed. Advising individuals with COVID-19 symptoms to inform their supervisors and seek testing, with guidance provided by the Occupational Health Nurse. Launching a COVID-19 self-assessment web portal for the U of T community. Notifying close contacts of affected individuals while maintaining confidentiality. Implementing cleaning and disinfecting procedures for potentially affected areas. Requiring the use of non-medical face masks in indoor common areas and providing masks to the U of T community. Reconfiguring physical spaces to facilitate physical distancing and installing hand sanitizer stations and Plexiglass barriers. Inspecting and upgrading ventilation equipment to reduce the risk of transmission in indoor spaces. These measures demonstrate the university's commitment to the health and safety of its community and aim to prevent and quickly respond to any COVID-19 cases that may arise on campus. While the university works to mitigate the spread of the virus, it also considers the needs of students with limited access to resources by safely opening its campuses. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of these preventative and responsive measures. The university's ability to quickly identify and isolate potential cases through self-assessment, contact tracing, and dedicated self-isolation spaces can significantly impact the number of hospitalizations. Additionally, the university's focus on maintaining physical distancing, proper ventilation, and the use of face masks can help reduce the overall transmission rate and, consequently, the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization.

Title: In WHO global pulse survey, 90% of countries report disruptions to essential health services since COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) published a survey highlighting the impact of COVID-19 on health systems in 105 countries. The survey found that 90% of countries experienced disruptions to their health services, with lowand middle-income nations facing the greatest challenges. Routine and elective services were often suspended, while critical care services like cancer treatment and HIV therapy faced interruptions in low-income countries. The survey emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems and maintain essential healthcare services during the pandemic. Key findings from the survey include disruptions in various areas of healthcare: routine immunization outreach (70%), facility-based services (61%), NCD diagnosis and treatment (69%), family planning (68%), mental health treatment (61%), and cancer diagnosis and treatment (55%). Additionally, disruptions were reported in malaria and tuberculosis treatment and antiretroviral therapy. Emergency services were impacted in a quarter of responding countries, with disruptions in emergency rooms, blood transfusions, and emergency surgeries. The disruptions resulted from a mix of supply and demand-side factors. Outpatient care attendance reduced due to lower demand, lockdowns, and financial difficulties. On the supply side, cancellation of elective services, staff redeployment for COVID-19 relief, service unavailability, and interruptions in medical equipment and health product supply were common issues. WHO recommends strategies such as triaging, online consultations, changes in prescribing practices, and public health information to mitigate service disruptions. However, only 14% of countries removed user fees to offset patients' financial difficulties. The survey emphasizes the need for real-time monitoring of service delivery and utilization as the pandemic evolves. To support countries, WHO is developing the COVID-19 Health Services Learning Hub, a platform for sharing experiences and learning from innovative practices. Additional surveys at the sub-national level and health facilities will assess the long-term impact of disruptions and help countries make informed decisions about mitigation strategies.
