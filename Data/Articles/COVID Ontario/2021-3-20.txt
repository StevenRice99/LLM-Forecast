Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Starting Monday, residents aged 75 and older can schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment through the provincial booking portal. Pharmacies in certain regions will offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot by appointment to those 60 and older. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has changed its guidelines to allow the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot to be used on those aged 65 and older, citing studies from the U.K. that found significant effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 and reduced hospitalizations due to COVID-19 among seniors. The province plans to expand the pharmacy program to more than 700 sites over the next two weeks and to 1,500 pharmacies across the province by the end of April. Certain family physicians in six regions will offer Oxford-AstraZeneca shots to patients aged 60 and up. These developments are likely to increase vaccine uptake among older adults, who are at higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19. This could lead to a reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada in the coming weeks and months.

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The study focuses on identifying Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) in the City of Toronto, which are high-density residential settings with a high proportion of older adults. The analysis highlights that 58.5% of older adults living in NORCs reside in neighborhoods with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, making them a priority for targeted vaccination efforts. The study suggests that mobile on-site vaccination in NORCs could be an efficient and equitable approach to protecting those at highest risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 489 NORCs identified in the City of Toronto, home to 70,013 older adults (65 years and above) 256 NORCs (52.4%) located in Ontario's top 30% of neighborhoods with the highest cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence 40,955 older adults (58.5% of all older adults in NORCs) reside in high SARS-CoV-2 incidence neighborhoods 18,144 older adults (aged 80 years and above) reside in high SARS-CoV-2 incidence neighborhoods Targeted vaccination efforts in NORCs could prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths Mobile on-site vaccination in NORCs is a feasible and practical approach to reach high-risk populations.
