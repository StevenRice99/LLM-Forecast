Title: Sturdier spike protein may explain coronavirus variants' faster spread: study
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Relevant.
The article is relevant because it discusses the D614G mutation, a fast-spreading coronavirus variant that originated in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. The study found that this variant has a more stable spike protein that makes it more contagious, but also less binding with humans' ACE2 receptors. This information could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it provides insights into the transmissibility and virulence of new variants.

Title: Mobile On-Site COVID-19 Vaccination of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities by Neighbourhood Risk in Toronto
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This text discusses a strategy for vaccinating residents in Neighborhoods of Risk (NORCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. NORCs are high-density residential areas with a high concentration of older adults and other vulnerable populations. The approach involves mobile on-site vaccination teams, community outreach, and collaboration with healthcare providers.
Key points:
Mobile on-site vaccination has been demonstrated to be practical and feasible in certain settings.
Outreach efforts are necessary to plan a vaccination initiative, as many NORCs have no existing relationship with the healthcare system.
Door-to-door vaccination may be necessary due to physical infrastructure limitations in some NORCs.
Collaboration with healthcare providers such as community paramedics who are familiar with the NORC environments will be beneficial.
The mobile on-site vaccination team needs to be coordinated and divided into smaller units responsible for different floors, with each unit consisting of vaccinator(s) and volunteers/other staff.
Potential barriers to vaccine uptake should be considered, including language barriers and support in completing consent forms.
When vaccinating a NORC, the entire building should be considered for vaccination (not just older adults), since many are mix-aged communities where residents are heavily intertwined and interactions between people within buildings are high.
The proposed approach could also be applied to other communities living in large tower blocks and buildings ("vertical" communities) or other high-density living environments situated in high SARS-CoV-2 risk neighborhoods, which would further advance uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario's hot spots.
The approach may provide a roadmap for a broader re-imagining of service delivery that supports aging in place.
