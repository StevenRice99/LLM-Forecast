Title: Most COVID-19 hospitalizations due to four conditions
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association estimated that nearly two-thirds of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States were due to four underlying conditions: obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure. The research team developed a statistical model using data on the association between these conditions and COVID-19 hospitalizations, as well as national data on hospitalization rates and the prevalence of the conditions. The model estimated that through November 2020, there were over 900,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US, and 64% of these might have been prevented if not for the presence of these four conditions. The conditions examined impaired the body's immune response, which may explain why COVID-19 causes more severe illness in people with these underlying health issues. The study also found that the risk of hospitalization varied by age and race/ethnicity. Older adults with diabetes, heart failure, or hypertension were more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals with the same condition. Additionally, Black adults had the highest proportion of hospitalizations attributable to all four conditions across all age groups. This research highlights the importance of addressing the high prevalence of heart and metabolic diseases in the US, as improving cardiometabolic health may help reduce hospitalizations from COVID-19. It also suggests that medical providers should educate patients at risk for severe COVID-19 about preventive lifestyle measures, such as improving diet and increasing physical activity. Overall, this article provides insights into the factors contributing to COVID-19 hospitalizations and suggests that addressing underlying health conditions may be crucial in reducing the burden of the pandemic on the healthcare system.

Here is a summary of the article: Entos Pharmaceuticals, an Edmonton-based company, has developed a DNA-based vaccine for COVID-19, Covigenix VAX-001, which has progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials in South Africa after successful Phase 1 trials. This vaccine is unique as it uses engineered DNA to stimulate an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, unlike conventional vaccines that use a weakened form of the virus. The CEO of Entos Pharmaceuticals, John Lewis, highlights the advantages of their DNA-based vaccine over the currently approved mRNA vaccines. He notes that RNA vaccines are unstable and require extremely low-temperature storage, making distribution challenging. In contrast, the Entos vaccine can be stored in a standard refrigerator for over a year. Lewis also emphasizes the need for multiple vaccines to combat the pandemic effectively, given the emergence of new variants and the limitations of current biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities. The development and production of the Entos vaccine involved collaboration with the University of Alberta's Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing (ACTM) facility, which produced the vaccine batch for clinical trials. ACTM received funding from federal and provincial governments and played a crucial role in demonstrating Canada's vaccine production capability. To continue the progress of the vaccine toward final approval and widespread distribution, significant additional funding will be required, with costs potentially running into several hundred million dollars. Entos is seeking further support from federal and provincial governments and highlighting the potential benefits of their second vaccine candidate, which is designed to provide broader protection against coronavirus mutations. The article concludes with Lewis' call for early and decisive investments in vaccine development and manufacturing to ensure timely access to much-needed solutions for Canada and the world.

Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Long-term care (LTC) homes in Ontario, Canada, were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination due to high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths among residents. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Ontario began in mid-December 2020, with LTC residents and staff as priority populations. As of February 23, 2021, 92% of LTC residents and 55% of LTC staff had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccination of LTC residents prevented an estimated 2,079 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 249 COVID-19 hospitalizations, and 615 COVID-19 deaths. Vaccination of LTC staff prevented an additional 590 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 COVID-19 hospitalizations, and one COVID-19 death. The relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections was reduced by 89% in LTC residents and 79% in LTC healthcare workers (HCWs) at 8 weeks after the start of vaccination. The relative risk of COVID-19 deaths was reduced by 96% in LTC residents. Public health measures implemented in late December 2020 and early January 2021, such as lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, also contributed to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The vaccine uptake among LTC staff was lower than expected, highlighting the need for education, communication, and financial support to increase vaccination rates. This real-world data demonstrates the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in LTC homes. This analysis provides important insights into the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on vulnerable populations and can help inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations by demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations and deaths.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have been a remarkable success in the fight against COVID-19. The crucial ingredient in each injection is mRNA, which prompts cells to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and helps the immune system develop antibodies. The development of mRNA vaccines faced challenges due to the delicate nature of mRNA and the difficulty of delivering it into cells. Scientists overcame these obstacles by using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system. LNPs protect mRNA and facilitate its entry into cells, but their development was complex and faced issues with toxicity and manufacturing consistency. The success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has brought mainstream attention to LNPs and nanoparticle technology. The article also highlights the potential of LNPs in other applications, such as gene therapy and CRISPR gene editing. However, there is ongoing research to optimize nanoparticles for vaccination and develop better methods for delivering mRNA into cells.
