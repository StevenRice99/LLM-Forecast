TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Vaccinations in long-term care homes have prevented hundreds of COVID-19 deaths and thousands of infections, with an 89% reduction in infections among residents and 79% among workers. Deaths from COVID-19 among long-term care residents were reduced by 96% over the same period. The report estimates that vaccinations prevented 250 hospitalizations between Dec. 14, 2020, and Feb. 23. Long-term care residents represent less than 1% of Ontario's population but have made up more than half of the COVID-19 deaths in the province.

These factors will be important to consider when forecasting future COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.
