Publisher: YGK News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article reports a decrease in community COVID-19 prevalence, outbreaks, and hospitalizations in the KFL&A region (where Kingston is located). Specifically:
61 active high-risk cases and 4 hospitalized in the community.
High vaccination rates in the region.
Decrease in COVID-19-related deaths (118 people have died to date).
No change in hospitalization numbers reported for the general population, only specific groups like long-term care homes remain subject to provincial directives.

Title: Hospital admissions and deaths due to acute cardiovascular events during the COVID-19 pandemic in residents of long-term care facilities
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
A 22.5% decline in MI admissions during the pandemic
A 15.1% drop in stroke admission rates during the pandemic
Case fatality rates remained largely unchanged
Reduced referral strategies and behaviors within LTCFs may have contributed to lower hospitalization rates

Title: Opioid use in the era of COVID-19: a multifaceted study of the opioid epidemic in Canada
Publisher: Frontiers
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The provided text appears to be a series of references related to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on opioid use disorder and opioid-related harms in North America, particularly in Canada and the United States.
To provide a concise summary:
1. Articles on opioid use disorder during the pandemic: 
Several studies examined the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic with opioid use disorder (OUD) in North America.
These studies investigated how the pandemic affected OUD treatment access, emergency department visits for OUD, and patient characteristics during this time.
2. Research on specific policies and programs: 
Some articles focused on methadone access, take-home doses of opioid agonist therapy, and the perceived decline in drug quality among people who use drugs (PWUD).
3. Government responses and data: 
The text includes references to government statements and reports from Canada, such as the Ontario Office of the Premier's announcements on reopening the province.
Data sources like Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Health Ontario provided information on opioid- and stimulant-related harms in Canada.
This collection of references suggests a comprehensive exploration of how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the opioid use disorder landscape in North America.

Title: Air pollution exposure linked to severe COVID-19 outcomes
Publisher: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Summary: The study found that higher annual average exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was associated with a greater risk of COVID-19-related events, including hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths. Key values include:
A 25% increase in hospital admissions per 3.2 µg/m3 increase in PM
A 42% increase in ICU admissions per 16.1 µg/m3 increase in NO2
These associations were similar to findings seen among COVID-19 cases in Ontario and Los Angeles, making the results relevant for forecasting in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Long-term exposure to air pollution and severe COVID-19 in Catalonia: a population-based cohort study
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
This text appears to be a detailed description of a study protocol for an epidemiological investigation into the association between air pollution and hospital length of stay (LOS) among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19.
Here are some key points that can be gleaned from the text:
1. Objective: The study aims to estimate the association between 2019 annual average air pollution and hospital LOS among those individuals who were hospitalized.
2. Study design: A retrospective cohort study using administrative data.
3. Exposures: Four air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, O3, BC) were used as exposures in the analysis.
4. Outcomes: Hospital length of stay (LOS) was the primary outcome.
5. Analytical approach: Negative binomial regression models were fitted to estimate the association between air pollution and hospital LOS.
6. Adjustments: A sequential adjustment for all exposures and outcomes was performed, adjusting for various covariates such as age, sex, tobacco smoking status, individual income, health risk group, area-level socioeconomic index, urbanicity, distance to the closest primary care unit, and average weekly proportion of test-positive individuals.
7. Sensitivity analyses: Six sensitivity analyses were conducted, including adjustments for potential mediators (Model 5), other socioeconomic indexes (Model 6), multiple imputations with chained equations (Model 7), restricting outcomes to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (Model 8), including COVID-19 diagnoses at nursing homes (Model 9), and focusing on individuals who did not move between census tracts (Model 10).
8. Exploratory analyses: Additional ad hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted, including censoring the cohort, adjusting smoking status, and analyzing outcomes restricted to primary care or hospital admissions.
9. Evaluation of nonlinearity: The potential for nonlinearity in age and body mass index was evaluated using penalized splines with three to six degrees of freedom.
The study protocol provides a detailed description of the analytical approach, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory analyses conducted to investigate the association between air pollution and hospital LOS among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19.
