Title: How Canadians' lifestyle behaviours changed during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: McGill Newsroom
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The McGill University study reveals that 60% of Canadians maintained or improved their lifestyle habits during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 40% adopted unhealthier habits. The research, based on data from 18-89-year-old Canadians during the first wave, identified two patterns: healthy and less healthy habit groups. Factors such as body image dissatisfaction, depression, stress, and gender minority identification correlated with less healthy habits. This knowledge can help identify at-risk individuals during crises and develop strategies to support those with mental health challenges. These findings provide valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations by considering the impact of lifestyle changes on overall health.

Title: Estimates of Bivalent mRNA Vaccine Durability in Preventing COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization and Critical Illness Among Adults with and Without Immunocompromising Conditions — VISION Network, Septe
Publisher: CDC
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses a study conducted by the CDC's VISION Network to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. The study included data from adults aged 18 and older with and without immunocompromising conditions who were hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness across five sites in seven states. Key findings of the study: For adults without immunocompromising conditions, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was 62% during the first 7-59 days after receiving a bivalent vaccine dose and waned to 24% by 120-179 days. VE against critical illness (ICU admission or in-hospital death) was higher and more sustained, with 69% protection during the first 7-59 days and 50% protection by 120-179 days. For adults with immunocompromising conditions, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization was lower, at 28% during the first 7-59 days and declining to 13% by 120-179 days. Receiving only monovalent vaccine doses provided lower protection, with VE of 21% for adults without immunocompromising conditions and 3% for those with immunocompromising conditions. The study supports the recommendation for eligible individuals to stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including receiving a bivalent booster dose for certain high-risk populations. The findings also highlight the importance of timely vaccination, as protection wanes over time. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider factors such as vaccination rates, booster uptake, immune protection, and the circulation of new variants. While the bivalent vaccines provide additional protection, the durability of this protection needs to be monitored, especially against emerging variants.

Title: COVID-19 Treatments: What We Know So Far
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Paxlovid is an antiviral oral medication created by Pfizer to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections in individuals ages 12 and older who are at high risk for severe disease. It combines two drugs, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, with the former preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and the latter boosting its levels in the body. Taken as three pills twice daily for five days, it has shown an 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Real-world studies by the CDC also showed a 51% lower hospitalization rate for adults who took Paxlovid within five days of diagnosis. However, it interacts with many medications, so an up-to-date medication list is crucial for healthcare providers. It is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals and those with severe liver or kidney disease. Some patients have reported a "rebound" of COVID-19 symptoms a few days after completing the treatment, but the FDA stated there was no clear association between Paxlovid and rebound cases based on available data. Overall, Paxlovid is a promising treatment option for eligible high-risk individuals to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and prevent hospitalizations.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study on long COVID provides valuable insights into the condition and aims to improve diagnostics and treatment. The research included nearly 10,000 Americans, with a focus on identifying common symptoms, potential subgroups, and a symptom-based scoring system. Long COVID, affecting multiple organs and tissues, can cause fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and other symptoms lasting months or years post-infection. The study found that long COVID was more prevalent and severe in participants infected before the Omicron variant emerged in 2021. The researchers established a scoring system based on 12 key symptoms, including post-exertional malaise, fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, gastrointestinal issues, heart palpitations, changes in sexual desire or capacity, loss of taste or smell, thirst, chronic cough, chest pain, and abnormal movements. This system helps identify patients with long COVID and categorizes them into four subgroups based on symptom clusters. The study also revealed that unvaccinated individuals, those infected before Omicron, and those with reinfections had higher chances and severity of long COVID. These findings have important implications for understanding and managing the condition. The RECOVER initiative is a nationwide effort to comprehend the long-term effects of COVID-19 and find ways to detect, treat, and prevent long COVID. The ongoing research will inform clinical trials expected to begin enrolling patients in 2023. As of April, an estimated 10% of infected adults in the U.S. suffer from long COVID symptoms, impacting their health and well-being. This large-scale study contributes significantly to our understanding of long COVID and paves the way for the development of effective interventions and treatments.

Title: No, the COVID-19 Pandemic Isn’t Over
Publisher: Health Essentials
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
On May 11, 2023, US President Joe Biden announced the end of the national state of emergency and public health emergency declarations for COVID-19. While this doesn't mean the pandemic is over, it signifies a shift in the US government's approach, with prevention, care, and treatment becoming more expensive for Americans. Despite a significant drop in cases and deaths from the virus's peak, COVID-19 continues to circulate and mutate globally, and the death rate remains high. Healthcare systems worldwide remain stressed, and the end of emergency declarations will impact costs, coverage, telehealth services, and emergency use authorizations. Underprivileged groups will be disproportionately affected by the changes, and the long-term effects of Long COVID are still a major concern. While the WHO still considers COVID-19 a pandemic as of May 2023, individual countries' responses and designations may vary. The article emphasizes that COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon and that the virus will continue to impact people's lives, especially those without adequate insurance coverage.

Title: It’s not only vaccines: Oxygen must be at the heart of the COVID-19 response
Publisher: Doctors Without Borders
Trusted: True

The article emphasizes the critical role of medical oxygen supply in the global response to COVID-19, in addition to vaccines and PPE. As vaccines are unavailable in most countries, people will continue to get infected with COVID-19, and without sufficient oxygen infrastructure, many will die. Oxygen is the most important medicine for severe COVID-19 patients, but its supply is often inadequate due to decades of neglect in lowerand middle-income countries. MSF highlights that unstable oxygen supplies kill patients, and hospitals in these countries rely on expensive and unreliable oxygen cylinders or small oxygen concentrators, which are insufficient for critical patients. The organization provides examples of the global oxygen shortage, including the current crisis in India and a hospital in Yemen supported by MSF that is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and running out of oxygen cylinders. MSF teams are implementing creative solutions to increase oxygen supply, such as linking oxygen concentrators together in South Africa and creating oxygen banks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. They also emphasize the need for practical solutions, such as providing more concentrators, regulating oxygen prices, and creating buffer stocks and reliable supply chains. These steps are crucial to save lives while addressing the underlying issue of underinvestment in oxygen infrastructure.

Title: Nova Scotia ends COVID-19 Health Protection Act order
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Health Protection Act order, implemented at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, has been lifted as of today. This decision was influenced by the WHO's stance that COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency. Dr. Robert Strang, the chief medical officer of health, stated that COVID-19 is now considered endemic, and the legal framework provided by the Health Protection Act order is no longer necessary. Employers and operators of high-risk settings are now responsible for creating their own COVID-19 policies, including masking and vaccination requirements. Public Health has provided guidance to operators of congregate settings on managing COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses. Nova Scotia Health and the IWK Health Centre still require employees to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination, with exceptions for medical and human rights reasons. Masking will be optional in non-clinical areas without patient contact, but masking requirements will remain in place for clinical areas and public spaces within health facilities. COVID-19 data updates will be less frequent, with weekly dashboards ending and monthly reports and Respiratory Watch bulletins starting in October. Dr. Strang encourages vulnerable individuals and those around them to continue wearing masks and getting COVID-19 vaccines, including spring and fall boosters. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the following: The level of immunity in the population: The availability and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, will impact the number of people vulnerable to severe illness requiring hospitalization. Circulation of new variants: The emergence and spread of new COVID-19 variants can influence the severity of infections and the effectiveness of existing vaccines. Healthcare system capacity: The ability of healthcare facilities to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients depends on various factors, including staffing levels, bed availability, and access to necessary equipment and resources. Public health measures: The continuation or relaxation of public health measures, such as masking and physical distancing, can impact the spread of the virus and the number of hospitalizations. Surveillance and testing: Monitoring COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations through testing and surveillance systems can provide data to inform forecasts and help identify any new waves or surges. By considering these factors and analyzing trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and other relevant data, public health officials and researchers can make informed forecasts and predictions about COVID-19 hospitalizations in the coming months.
