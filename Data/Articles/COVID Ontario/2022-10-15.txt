Title: The COVID emergency may be over — but when will the pandemic end?

The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Rising hospitalizations and new Omicron subvariants are raising concern for Canada's overburdened health-care system. Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and B.C. are already seeing a rise in hospitalizations, putting added pressure on the health-care system. The World Health Organization (WHO) is tracking over 300 Omicron subvariants worldwide, with new subvariants showing high levels of immune evasion. Experts warn that the pandemic's ongoing burden on the health-care system will be felt for years to come, with long COVID affecting a subset of those infected and delays to cancer screenings and surgeries causing massive backlogs. Vaccination coverage is still a concern, with 32% of the world's population yet to receive a single dose. The WHO director-general notes that ongoing global risks due to large gaps in vaccination, reduced surveillance, low rates of testing and sequencing, and ongoing "uncertainties" about the impact of variants will weigh heavily into the decision of whether to declare the COVID emergency over. Experts predict that COVID-19 will continue to mutate and spread, with new variants emerging that have the potential to evade immunity and drive transmission globally. Updated vaccines, such as the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, have shown promise in increasing neutralizing antibody response, but data is limited so far. Hybrid immunity, achieved through a combination of vaccination and prior infection, has been shown to provide strong protection against Omicron hospitalization. These points highlight the ongoing challenges and uncertainties in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Ontario, Canada, and emphasize the need for continued vigilance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness for future waves.

Title: Extended compartmental model for modeling COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia

Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. It describes a deterministic age-structured compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with a population stratified into 5 age groups. The model extends the standard SEIR model to include compartments for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease progression, vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, hospital and ICU admissions, and mortality. Key values important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include parameters such as vaccination rate, proportion of mild/asymptomatic infections, proportion of hospitalizations, proportion of intensive care hospitalizations, proportion of deaths, and various duration parameters. The model produces projections for daily positive cases, hospitalizations, intensive care admissions, deaths, and cumulative projections across all age groups. The model is calibrated to the current epidemic state by adjusting parameters daily based on data on infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and vaccination progress. The model evaluation includes forecasting new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
