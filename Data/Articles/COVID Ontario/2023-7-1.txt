Title: CRA says 20 employees fired for claiming COVID-19 benefits while working - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has terminated 20 employees and is investigating approximately 600 others who may have inappropriately claimed COVID-19 benefits while still working for the agency. The CRA was responsible for administering the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) from March to September 2020, providing $2,000 per month to eligible applicants. To qualify for CERB, individuals had to have lost their primary job or have their income drop below $1,000 per month due to the pandemic. The internal review was sparked by an auditor general's report that identified $4.9 billion in pandemic benefits, including wage subsidies, were given to ineligible recipients. The CRA has since recovered $2.3 billion through voluntary repayments and has started clawing back tax refunds to collect the remaining debt. This comes as the CRA also claws back money from Canadians who were overpaid in COVID-19 benefits during the recent tax season.

Title: Role of immigration and emigration on the spread of COVID-19 in a multipatch environment: a case study of India
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: This article proposes a multi-patch model to study the spread of COVID-19 in different regions, with a focus on the impact of population movement and limited medical resources. The model accounts for quarantine, saturated treatment, and a nonlinear incidence rate that considers individuals' behavior to avoid contracting the disease. The movement between patches is allowed for susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and recovered individuals, while symptomatic and quarantined individuals are assumed to be unable to move. The article aims to understand the effect of population movement on the COVID-19 spread and provides a practical example using data from three Indian states: Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. The article begins by discussing the varying patterns of COVID-19 spread in different regions, influenced by factors such as travel, population density, literacy, community behavior, and healthcare infrastructure. It highlights the role of human mobility in accelerating the spread of the virus and presents a multi-patch modeling approach to address this challenge. The model is then described in detail, including the assumptions and compartments used. The model considers three patches (regions) and allows movement between them for certain compartments (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and recovered). It accounts for quarantine, saturated treatment due to limited medical resources, and a nonlinear incidence rate. The inhibitory behavior of healthy individuals to avoid infection is incorporated into the model. The existence and stability of both the disease-free and endemic equilibriums are analyzed. Three different cases are explored: when both emigration and immigration are allowed, when only emigration is allowed, and when neither is allowed. The article provides a detailed analysis of each case, including the derivation of the basic reproduction number and the stability analysis of the equilibriums. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the dynamics of the model and the impact of population movement on the spread of COVID-19. The parameter estimation and short-term prediction section involves using data from the three Indian states to estimate the model parameters. This includes estimating the migration rates between the patches and the parameters related to the COVID-19 disease dynamics, such as transmission rates and recovery rates. The estimated parameters are then used to make short-term predictions about the disease spread in each state. The article concludes by summarizing the key findings and highlighting the importance of considering population movement and limited medical resources in COVID-19 modeling. It emphasizes that the multi-patch model can provide valuable insights into the impact of mobility on the disease spread and help in forecasting hospitalizations and designing effective intervention strategies. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations based on this article, the following factors should be considered: Population mobility: The model emphasizes the impact of population movement between different regions on the spread of COVID-19. Monitoring and analyzing mobility data can help predict the potential hotspots and high-risk areas for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Limited medical resources: The saturated treatment compartment in the model accounts for limited medical resources, such as hospital beds, ventilators, and oxygen cylinders. By estimating the treatment capacity and including it in the model, predictions can be made about the number of individuals who may require hospitalization and the risk of overwhelming healthcare infrastructure. Inhibitory behavior: The nonlinear incidence rate in the model captures the behavior of healthy individuals to avoid contracting the disease. As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases, individuals may adopt precautionary measures, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, which can impact the transmission rate and, subsequently, hospitalizations. Intervention strategies: The article highlights the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as face masks, sanitation, and social distancing, in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Including the impact of these interventions in the model can help forecast their effect on hospitalizations. Parameter estimation: Accurate parameter estimation using local data, such as transmission rates, recovery rates, and migration rates, is crucial for reliable forecasting. The article provides a framework for estimating these parameters and making short-term predictions. By incorporating these factors into the multi-patch model and analyzing the dynamics, forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations can be made for different regions. The model can help identify high-risk areas, assess the impact of mobility and limited medical resources, and inform intervention strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and manage healthcare resources effectively.

Title: New WHO–HBSC data shed light on COVID-19 pandemic's effects on children and adolescents
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected young people, especially girls, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, with prolonged school closures and lack of support structures. New data from WHO/Europe and the HBSC study highlight the negative consequences for their mental health and well-being, with a significant number reporting negative impacts on their mental health, life satisfaction, and school performance. Social support from family, teachers, and peers is crucial in mitigating these effects, but disparities in support based on socioeconomic status remain a concern. On average, schools were closed for 138 days between January 2020 and December 2022, disrupting adolescents' education and increasing school pressure, especially for girls and older students. The findings emphasize the urgent need for tailored policy interventions, including mental health support, educational programs, and strengthened social support systems, to address the unique challenges faced by children and adolescents during and after the pandemic.

Title: Markups and inflation: Evidence from firm-level data
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article examines the relationship between markups, inflation, and supply and demand shocks in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. It finds that aggregate markups for non-financial businesses, excluding oil and gas industries, increased by 2.6% from the two years before the pandemic to the second quarter of 2022, while consumer price inflation, excluding energy, rose by 10.5% during the same period. The study suggests that market power may contribute to inflation in imperfectly competitive markets and that markups can be used to study changes in competitive pressure. The relationship between markups and demand shocks is empirically determined, as different frameworks predict different outcomes. Input shortages and rising costs due to supply shocks may lead to the exit of less productive businesses, increasing the market power and markups of remaining businesses. The study estimates markups using firm-level data and focuses on the association between changes in markups and inflation rather than on markups as a measure of competition.

Here is a summary of the article, including key facts to aid in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: The article discusses the link between diabetes and COVID-19, highlighting the increased risk of severe outcomes and complications for individuals with diabetes who contract COVID-19. It also explores the phenomenon of new-onset diabetes after COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms behind the COVID-19-diabetes relationship. The article further provides insights into the treatment and management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19, including the importance of physical activity, sleep, and nutrition. Additionally, it addresses the question of underlying mechanisms, possible drug interactions, and the risk factors for developing post-COVID diabetes. Key Facts for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: People with diabetes who get COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and premature death. Individuals with comorbidities such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or obesity are at an even higher risk of serious COVID-19 complications. COVID-19 affects the microvasculature, similar to diabetes, and can cause disrupted glucose and metabolic control in diabetic patients. Long COVID, characterized by new, ongoing, or returning symptoms at least 4 weeks after initial infection, may be more likely to develop in people with diabetes. Metformin decreased the likelihood of long COVID in adults with overweight or obesity. COVID-19 can impact the cardiovascular and microvascular systems, making physical activity, sleep management, and nutrition crucial for patients with diabetes post-COVID-19 infection. Paxlovid, a medication for acute COVID-19, has shown no clinically relevant drug interactions with common diabetes medications. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may infect pancreatic beta cells, reducing insulin secretion or causing cell death, leading to decreased insulin production. Inflammation caused by COVID-19 can also contribute to decreased insulin secretion and increased resistance to circulating insulin. The risk of new-onset diabetes increases by about 60% in individuals who have had COVID-19, and this risk is higher with more severe COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 vaccination lowers the risk of developing incident diabetes after COVID-19. Screening for diabetes in individuals who have had COVID-19, especially severe cases, is important to identify new-onset diabetes. These key facts can help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations by identifying high-risk individuals and understanding the potential complications and treatment considerations for patients with diabetes and COVID-19.

Title: Did COVID-19 accelerate the green transition?
Publisher: OECD
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the potential impact of fiscal spending policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the transition to a low-carbon economy. The analysis suggests that the USD 1.29 trillion invested in low-carbon technology development and diffusion could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel imports while boosting growth in clean sectors. This forecast is based on the substantial funding committed to emerging technologies such as carbon capture and green hydrogen, which could address the climate investment gap. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic response may provide an opportunity not just to recover the economy but also to "build back better" by accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future and mitigating climate change.
