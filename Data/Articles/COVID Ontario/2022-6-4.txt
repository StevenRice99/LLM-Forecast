Title: Understanding Bank Deposit Growth during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Federal Reserve
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The article discusses the rapid growth in bank deposits in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies four factors that contributed to this trend. The first factor was the initial spike in commercial and industrial (C&I) credit line drawdowns by businesses at the onset of the pandemic to build cash buffers. This created a significant increase in deposits as the counterpart to the drawdown. The second factor was the Federal Reserve's asset purchases, which led to the creation of reserves and deposits in the banking system. The Fed's actions contributed to deposit growth, especially during the early stages of the pandemic. The third factor was large fiscal stimulus measures provided to households, who were more likely to hold savings in the form of deposits. This included direct payments, extended unemployment benefits, and augmented child tax credits. The fourth factor was a higher personal savings rate during the pandemic, as households cut their consumption expenditures and chose to keep their savings in liquid bank deposits due to economic uncertainty. The combination of these factors resulted in a rapid and sustained growth in bank deposits, with deposits at domestic commercial banks increasing by more than 35% since the end of 2019. The article also discusses the role of banks' loan and securities holdings in contributing to deposit growth. While initial deposit growth was driven by credit line draws, subsequent growth was supported by banks' purchases of securities, particularly US Treasury securities and agency MBS. The unprecedented increase in deposits during the pandemic has led to a historically high level of deposits-to-GDP ratio, which has implications for the banking system and monetary policy. While the article provides insights into the factors driving deposit growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, it does not directly provide facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, understanding the economic impact of the pandemic and the government's response, including fiscal stimulus and Federal Reserve actions, can provide context for analyzing the healthcare system's capacity and demand for hospitalizations.

Title: Dal researcher hopes to unravel mystery of 'brain fog' linked to severe COVID-19 cases
Publisher: Dal News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the growing number of people who experience "brain fog" and other cognitive impairments long after a COVID-19 infection. Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, word-finding difficulties, dizziness, and an inability to focus. These symptoms can persist for weeks, months, or even years, and may be accompanied by fatigue, muscle weakness, and sleep disorders. Researchers at Dalhousie University are studying these neurological deficits and their underlying biology by analyzing brain abnormalities in COVID-19 survivors through clinical assessments, cognitive tests, and MRI scans. The study aims to find associations between brain abnormalities and cognitive symptoms, with the goal of developing treatment options for long-COVID patients. Research has indicated that brain fog is more prevalent in individuals with severe COVID-19 infections, affecting around 60% of hospitalized patients. However, a recent study also found that cognitive impairments can persist for over a year in patients who were never hospitalized. The Dalhousie University study seeks to shed light on the phenomenon and provide insights into the treatment of long-haul COVID-19 patients. Understanding the neurological impact of COVID-19 is crucial for developing effective rehabilitation strategies and predicting the long-term consequences of the disease. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations due to these neurological impacts is complex and multifaceted. While the presence of brain fog and cognitive impairments may not directly lead to hospitalization, they could be indicative of more severe infections and long-term health consequences. As such, these factors should be considered in conjunction with other variables, such as infection rates, vaccine effectiveness, and the emergence of new variants, to make informed predictions about COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: The COVID-19 Pipeline: Vaccines and Treatments on the Horizon
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Title: The COVID-19 Pipeline: Vaccines and Treatments on the Horizon The article provides an overview of the global pipeline for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments as of September 2021, with a spotlight on Canada's response to the pandemic. Global COVID-19 Pipeline: As of September 2021, 663 vaccines and therapies were in clinical development worldwide for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Most of these were novel medicines in Phase II or III clinical trials. Treatments made up over 80% of the medicines indicated for COVID-19. As of April 2022, there were 118 marketed COVID-19 medicines globally. Upcoming clinical trials are focusing more on treatments than vaccines due to the emergence of new COVID-19 strains like Omicron. Current COVID-19 treatments include antivirals (e.g., Veklury, Paxlovid) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., casirivimab, imdevimab). Spotlight on Canada: Canada's health authorities are committed to the immunization response plan published in December 2020. Six vaccines and five therapies for COVID-19 have been approved in Canada. Six additional vaccines and nine therapy options are under review by Health Canada. Health Canada is using expedited approval timelines and interim orders to facilitate the availability of drugs for COVID-19. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments. The development and approval of new medicines can help reduce the severity of the disease and lower hospitalization rates. However, the emergence of new variants and the ongoing evolution of the virus may impact the effectiveness of existing treatments and vaccines. Therefore, the global pipeline for COVID-19 medicines is crucial in managing the pandemic and improving patient outcomes.

Title: Immune modulator drugs improved survival for people hospitalized with COVID-19
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted a large clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of immune modulator drugs infliximab and abatacept in treating adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The trial found that while these drugs did not significantly reduce the time to recovery, they substantially improved clinical status and reduced mortality rates. Participants receiving infliximab had a death rate of 10.0%, compared to 14.5% in the placebo group, while those receiving abatacept had a death rate of 11.0% compared to 15.0% in the placebo group. These results suggest that infliximab and abatacept could be promising treatments for reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly when used in addition to standard care such as remdesivir and dexamethasone. The trial enrolled nearly 2,000 participants across medical facilities in the United States and Latin America. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) coordinated the trial and emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships in accelerating therapeutic solutions during the COVID-19 crisis.

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article presents the results of a Pew Research Center survey conducted to understand the preferences and experiences of US teens regarding their schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is a summary of the key points: A majority of teens (65%) prefer in-person learning over virtual or hybrid options, with 8% opting for completely online schooling and 18% preferring a mix. Hispanic and lower-income teens are more likely to fear falling behind in school due to COVID-19 disruptions, with 28% expressing extreme or very high worry compared to 19% of Black teens and 11% of White teens. Parents from lower-income households also express more concern about the impact of the pandemic on their children's education, with 44% of those earning less than $30,000 a year worried about their teens falling behind. While 28% of teens are satisfied with how their schools handled virtual learning, 33% are neutral, and 30% are dissatisfied. The pandemic has impacted teens' social connections, with 45% feeling closer to their parents or guardians, while a third feel less close to classmates and teachers. About 28% of teens face challenges related to the "homework gap," with issues like lacking a computer or reliable internet access. This is more prevalent in lower-income households, with 24% facing these challenges compared to 8% in higher-income homes. While the article does not provide direct insights into forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the impact of the pandemic on teens' education and social well-being is highlighted.

Title: B.C. man among first Canadians approved for COVID-19 vaccine injury payout
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the case of Ross Wightman, who was partially paralyzed likely due to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Wightman was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare condition affecting the nervous system, which can cause paralysis, muscle weakness, and even death. GBS diagnoses following COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare, approximately one in 700,000 according to the BCCDC and Health Canada. However, there have been 10 reports of individuals hospitalized with GBS within 30 days of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine since December 2020, with over 11.7 million doses administered in BC alone. Wightman has been approved for a COVID-19 vaccine injury benefit, one of a handful of Canadians to receive this approval. The maximum payout under the program is approximately $284,000, with additional income replacement up to $90,000 per year. Prior to the pandemic, Canada was the only G7 country without a vaccine injury compensation program, but the mass COVID-19 immunization plan spurred the development of the VISP. Dr. Kumanan Wilson, a physician and expert in vaccine hesitancy, notes that while vaccines are generally safe, rare events can happen, and individuals affected should be supported. The risks of COVID-19 infection far outweigh the risks of adverse reactions to vaccines. Wilson also mentions that there were challenges in determining what constitutes a serious illness associated with a vaccine, and GBS was among the disorders discussed due to its severe health challenges. Recipients of the injury benefit who are dissatisfied with the assessed payout have the right to appeal, as the VISP is still in its early stages and adaptations will be made based on initial claims.

Title: Online symptoms self-assessment during COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of a COVID-19 portal responses from Canada
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Between April 10 and July 29, 2020, the COVID-19 self-assessment portal received 34,144 responses, with 1,250 (3.7%) exhibiting emergency symptoms and 14,340 (42%) reporting non-emergency symptoms. The highest response volume occurred in the third week of June, coinciding with a surge in COVID-19 cases. Sore throat, headache, fatigue, digestive problems, and cough were the most common symptoms reported. The analysis revealed regional variations in symptom counts, with up to 30% of respondents in certain subregions reporting three or more COVID-19 symptoms. The portal effectively linked individuals with potential symptoms to primary healthcare providers, preventing unnecessary emergency room visits. About 74.2% of respondents with symptoms had a primary care provider for follow-up, while 17% without a regular provider received support through an on-call provider. Further analysis indicated a positive correlation between the number of portal symptom reports and actual COVID-19 cases in specific sub-regions, with a lag time of 2-3 weeks. This suggests that individuals utilized the portal in response to local outbreaks. The geographic distribution of responses and symptoms was analyzed, with the N2 region receiving the highest number of responses. The number of symptoms reported through the portal was generally negatively correlated with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, except for a few sub-regions that showed a positive correlation with a lag. This indicates that the portal usage was influenced by local outbreak patterns.

Title: COVID-19 and thyroid dysfunction: Study finds link
Publisher: Medical News Today
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the University of Milan have discovered a correlation between thyroid dysfunction and COVID-19 severity. The study, presented at the 24th European Congress of Endocrinology, revealed that individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 exhibited evidence of thyroid dysfunction even one year after infection. The thyroid gland regulates crucial body functions, including metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature. Thyroid dysfunction encompasses conditions such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, each involving an imbalance in hormone production. Lead author Dr. Ilaria Muller explained that COVID-19 impacts thyroid function through various mechanisms, including non-thyroidal illness syndrome, cytokine storm, and alterations in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. The study analyzed 100 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 and found a frequent occurrence of thyroiditis. While patients' thyroid levels returned to normal after COVID-19 recovery, subsequent examinations revealed residual thyroiditis in half the patients a year later. This research highlights the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland, underscoring the importance of healthcare providers conducting additional follow-ups. While the study establishes a link between COVID-19 and thyroid dysfunction, further research is likely needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and their potential impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Title: COVID-19 and mandatory vaccination: Ethical considerations
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
The document discusses ethical considerations around mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, especially as the vaccine landscape has evolved to include authorized vaccines for children and more data and experience with vaccination mandates. Here are the key points summarized: 1. Ethical Principles: The discussion centers on balancing individual freedoms and public health benefits. Key ethical principles include respect for autonomy, beneficence (preventing harm), non-maleficence (doing no harm), and justice or fairness in distribution and access. 2. Individual Autonomy vs. Community Benefits: Mandatory vaccination may limit individual autonomy, but it can also help protect those who cannot be vaccinated and contribute to community benefits, such as herd immunity and reduced strain on healthcare resources. 3. Risk-Benefit Assessment: COVID-19 vaccines have proven safe and effective, significantly reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. This benefit strongly weighs in favor of vaccination mandates, especially in high-risk settings like healthcare facilities. 4. Fair Distribution and Access: Ethical mandates ensure equitable access to vaccines and do not exacerbate existing social and health inequities. This includes addressing barriers to vaccine access, such as transportation, cost, and education. 5. Exceptions and Accommodations: Ethical frameworks for mandatory vaccination should include exemptions for medical reasons and sincerely held religious or ethical beliefs. Accommodations, such as regular testing or remote work, may be considered for those unable or unwilling to be vaccinated. 6. Transparency and Public Trust: Transparency in decision-making processes and clear, accurate, and timely communication about vaccine safety and effectiveness are crucial for maintaining public trust and acceptance of vaccination mandates. 7. Global Equity: Considerations of vaccine mandates must also address global equity. Wealthy nations implementing mandates should ensure that vaccine distribution to lower-income countries is not negatively impacted, promoting vaccine access worldwide. 8. Adaptation to New Evidence: Ethical frameworks must be adaptable as new evidence emerges about vaccine safety, efficacy, and the evolving nature of the virus. This includes considering mandates for booster shots or adapting to new variants. 9. Balancing Rights and Responsibilities: Mandatory vaccination policies should be implemented alongside other preventive measures, such as masking and physical distancing, to respect individual rights while also promoting community health. 10. Review and Revision: Ethical frameworks for vaccine mandates should be regularly reviewed and revised based on evolving scientific evidence, public health needs, and societal values. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, mandatory vaccination policies, when implemented ethically and effectively, can significantly reduce the strain on healthcare systems by decreasing the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization. This is especially true for high-risk settings like long-term care facilities and hospitals. Additionally, high vaccination rates can help prevent the emergence of new variants that may evade existing immune responses and cause more severe disease. Therefore, ethical considerations favoring mandatory vaccination contribute to more accurate and positive forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalization rates.
