Title: WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its global COVID-19 vaccination guidelines, deeming healthy children and adolescents as low priority for vaccination. The updated guidelines aim to prioritize vaccines for those at the highest risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19, including older individuals, immunocompromised people, healthcare workers, and pregnant people. The recommendations reflect the current Omicron stage of the pandemic and consider the high levels of population immunity due to a combination of vaccination and infection. For high-risk groups, SAGE recommends additional booster doses, while for medium-risk groups, they suggest primary vaccination and the first booster but do not routinely recommend extra boosters. Healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years may be vaccinated based on factors like disease burden and cost-effectiveness in individual countries. The guidance could change if the pandemic situation evolves and is meant to provide a flexible framework for countries to make their own vaccine recommendations. The revised guidelines also acknowledge the competing health priorities, especially the need for children to catch up on routine vaccinations missed during the pandemic. Measles, a key indicator of vaccine-preventable diseases, is on the rise across all of WHO's regions, underscoring the importance of strengthening and restoring routine immunization programs worldwide. Additionally, the presence of circulating poliovirus in several countries highlights the need to improve immune vaccine coverage and supplement with injectable polio vaccine doses.

This article discusses the impact of COVID-19 misinformation and vaccine hesitancy in Africa, with a focus on Morocco as a case study. Here are the key points: Misinformation from the US and Europe, such as racist comments by French doctors suggesting Africa as a testing ground, has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in Africa. A study by the Africa CDC found that 45% of respondents in 15 African countries believed rumors that Africans were used as guinea pigs in vaccine trials. The Moroccan Lawyers Club is suing the French doctors for discrimination, arguing that their comments may have endangered African lives by discouraging them from taking COVID-19 vaccines. Unvaccinated individuals may be more likely to incubate new COVID-19 variants, prolonging the pandemic in developing nations with low vaccination rates. Complex factors contribute to vaccine hesitancy in various countries, including historical scandals, poor communication, and distrust of government health policies. Social media has been a significant source of misinformation, with studies showing higher levels of hesitancy among those relying primarily on social media for news. Morocco's colonial history with France made the racist comments by French doctors particularly offensive to Moroccans, exacerbating vaccine hesitancy. The Moroccan government's effective campaign and peer influence have helped persuade many Moroccans to get vaccinated. While nearly two-thirds of Moroccans are fully vaccinated, the African region still has low vaccination rates overall, with misinformation being a contributing factor. The fight against COVID-19 misinformation continues, and a lawsuit against the French doctors is ongoing, with one of them accused of violating French law by provoking discrimination.

Here is a summary of the article: As of March 10, 2023, the death rate from COVID-19 in the United States varied by state, with Mississippi having the highest death rate per 100,000 people at 532.5, followed by Oklahoma at 498.5, and West Virginia at 469.6. On the other hand, Vermont had the lowest death rate at 132.9, followed by California at 143.4, and Hawaii at 144.7. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider various factors such as vaccination rates, booster uptake, and the prevalence of new variants. Hospitalization data can also provide insights into the severity of cases and the capacity of healthcare systems. Additionally, waste-water surveillance and community transmission rates can help identify areas with higher infection rates, which may lead to increased hospitalizations. It's worth noting that the data presented in the article may not include the latest updates, and the situation may have changed since March 10, 2023.

Title: mRNA vaccine beats infection for key defense against COVID-19, Stanford Medicine scientists find
Publisher: Stanford Medical Center Report
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Stanford Medicine investigators have found that the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine is much more effective than natural infection at stimulating the production of killer T cells, which are crucial for fighting future SARS-CoV-2 infections. The study, published in Immunity, suggests that vaccination before infection is key to bolstering the body's immune response to COVID-19. The investigation, led by Mark Davis, a professor of microbiology and immunology, showed that getting vaccinated after a SARS-CoV-2 infection does boost the number and activity of killer T cells, but not to the same extent as vaccination before infection. This suggests that the order of vaccine and infection could impact the effectiveness of the immune response and potentially influence the development of long COVID. Killer T cells play a unique role in the immune system, patrolling the body's tissues and killing infected cells, unlike antibodies, which prevent viruses from entering cells. An insufficient number or activation of killer T cells can give viruses extra time to replicate and spread, compromising the body's defense against infection. The study provides valuable insights into the workings of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and emphasizes the importance of vaccination in preparing the body's immune system to fight COVID-19 effectively.

Title: WHO recommends COVID-19 boosters for high-risk adults 6-12 months after last dose
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The WHO has issued new COVID-19 vaccination recommendations, prioritizing high-risk groups such as older adults and those with underlying health conditions for boosters. The updated guidelines suggest that healthy children and adolescents are a "low priority" for vaccination and that additional boosters beyond the third dose are not necessary for medium-priority groups, including healthy adults under 50-60 and children with comorbidities. The WHO's recommendations are based on the current disease landscape and global immunity levels, aiming to focus on protecting those most vulnerable to severe disease and death. Some high-income countries like the UK and Canada are already offering boosters to high-risk groups, with Canada's NACI recommending an additional booster for those at higher risk of severe illness, including adults in long-term care, immunocompromised individuals, and adults over 65. The WHO's guidance emphasizes the importance of vaccinating the most vulnerable and considers the cost-effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, but it does not provide long-term guidance on annual boosters.

Title: Why Canada needs a national pandemic day: Senator Mégie
Publisher: Senate of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Three years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, people are eager to move on, but the impact of the virus on our society and healthcare system will be long-lasting. To commemorate this, Bill S-209 proposes designating March 11 as Pandemic Observance Day in Canada. The bill outlines three objectives for this day: to remember those who were lost and affected by the pandemic, to reflect on the evolution of the pandemic and the response to it, and to prepare for potential future health emergencies. This day will be a chance to honor those who sacrificed and showed solidarity during the pandemic, as well as to address the inequalities it exacerbated. It will also be an opportunity to assess our preparedness and learn from the past, as each crisis presents opportunities for change. While Canada has made progress in terms of access to tests, vaccines, and preventative measures, there are still global disparities in resources that need to be addressed. Additionally, the long-term effects of COVID-19, such as long COVID, are still not fully understood, and the pandemic's impact on various sectors like healthcare, immigration, and the environment will be felt for years to come. By establishing Pandemic Observance Day, we can ensure that we continue to recover, prepare, and remember those affected by COVID-19.

Here is a summary of the article: A study by Mark Davis, a Stanford University immunology professor, examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 72 individuals during the early months of 2021 when the first COVID-19 vaccines became available. The study focused on three groups: unvaccinated individuals who had COVID-19, fully vaccinated individuals with no infection, and individuals vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19. The researchers found that levels of CD8 T cells, which destroy infected cells, were lower in people vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19 compared to those vaccinated without prior infection. This contrasts with antibody responses, where hybrid immunity leads to higher antibody levels. The study also revealed that vaccinated individuals without COVID-19 generated significantly higher levels of CD8 T cells compared to their baseline, while those who recovered from COVID-19 and then got vaccinated had lower levels. Davis suggests that the virus may suppress CD8 responses, making it challenging for CD8 cell populations to recover. The findings raise concerns about the potential impact on long COVID risks and the durability of protection against severe disease. Experts believe that T-cell responses play a crucial role in preventing severe COVID-19 cases that lead to hospitalization or death. Davis highlights the relevance of these results for discussions about booster shots and encourages further investigations into stimulating CD8 T cell responses, especially with other vaccine formulations. The study also found asynchronous CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, which may be related to its formulation. In conclusion, the research underscores the potential lasting impact of COVID-19 on the immune system and the need for further studies to enhance our understanding of T-cell immunity and its role in protection against the virus.
