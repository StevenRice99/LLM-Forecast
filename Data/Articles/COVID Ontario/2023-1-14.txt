Title: B.C. confirms 24 cases of the new COVID-19 subvariant that has been spreading in the U.S.
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article is not directly relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it primarily discusses the situation in British Columbia, including the prevalence of the XBB 1.5 subvariant, hospitalization rates, and influenza trends. However, some information could be indirectly useful for forecasting in Ontario, such as: The rapid spread of the XBB 1.5 subvariant in the U.S. and its potential to become a dominant strain, which could impact Ontario as well. The decline in hospitalizations and COVID-19 deaths in B.C., which might indicate a similar trend in other provinces, including Ontario. The discussion of influenza and RSV trends, which could be relevant for understanding the broader respiratory illness season in Ontario. Therefore, I would not say "FALSE", but rather provide this summary with a note that the article's relevance is indirect and requires careful consideration of the differences between B.C. and Ontario.

Title: Canada's flu season is winding down, data shows, but it may be the calm before a COVID storm
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 hospitalizations are expected to increase in January and February, potentially due to the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 and waning protection from COVID-19 vaccines. Federal data showed an uptick in SARS-CoV-2 tests coming back positive across multiple regions by the end of 2022. Physicians are bracing for a potential wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations, particularly among adults, as flu season winds down. The spread of RSV also remains high, which could continue to bring more sick children into pediatric hospitals. Hospital capacity to respond to the surge in COVID-19 and RSV cases remains a challenge. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Expected increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in January and February Spread of Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 Waning protection from COVID-19 vaccines Uptick in SARS-CoV-2 tests coming back positive High circulation of RSV Hospital capacity to respond to the surge in cases.

Title: COVID-19 vaccination rates lower in Windsor-Essex compared to Ontario average
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Low COVID-19 booster vaccine uptake in Windsor-Essex, with only 47.6% of residents receiving their third dose and 19.9% receiving their fourth dose, which is lower than the provincial average. A new, more infectious subvariant called XBB.1.5 (also known as the "Kraken" variant) is emerging in the U.S. and is believed to be already present in Windsor. Disease activity is increasing in Windsor-Essex in January, with rising cases, positive cases, hospitalizations, and six deaths. Windsor-Essex's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Shanker Nesathurai, is concerned about the low vaccine uptake and the potential impact on the community. The article also mentions that Windsor-Essex is a border community, which may make it more susceptible to the spread of new variants. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest a potential increase in cases and hospitalizations in the region, particularly if the new subvariant spreads widely. The low vaccine uptake and increasing disease activity are also concerning indicators that may impact hospitalization rates.

Title: Why XBB.1.5 — the latest Omicron offshoot — could 'outcompete' other COVID-19 subvariants
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The XBB.1.5 variant, a sublineage of Omicron, is rising rapidly in the US and has been detected in 29 countries, including Canada. As of Wednesday, 12 cases of XBB.1.5 had been detected in BC, and 24 genomes classified as XBB.1.5 had been submitted nationally, with most sampled from Ontario. Experts expect XBB.1.5 to eventually outcompete the currently predominant BA.5-derived lineages in Canada. The variant has a mash-up of mutations that make it easier to catch and spread, and it may lead to an increase in infections, particularly among the vulnerable and under-vaccinated. Updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective at preventing serious illness from XBB.1.5. The rise of XBB.1.5 has been linked to higher COVID-19 hospitalizations in certain US regions, raising concerns about protecting patients and healthcare workers from infections. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of XBB.1.5 cases detected in Ontario Rate of growth of XBB.1.5 cases in Ontario Effectiveness of updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against XBB.1.5 Impact of XBB.1.5 on hospitalizations in Ontario Vulnerability of the population to XBB.1.5, particularly among the under-vaccinated and those with compromised immune systems.

Title: N.B. COVID-19 hazard index highest in Canada, says research group
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ontario has an estimated COVID infection rate of one in every 34 people, which is the highest in Canada. The national average for COVID deaths is currently 8.2 times higher than the moderate risk period, around early June 2021. The article mentions that low booster rates and lack of protections for those at high-risk are contributing to higher hospitalization and death rates. A new Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the northeastern United States, and it is possible that Ontario might be one of the early provinces in Canada to be affected by this variant. These values suggest that Ontario is at a high risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations, and the situation may worsen in the coming weeks due to the spread of the new Omicron subvariant and low booster rates.
