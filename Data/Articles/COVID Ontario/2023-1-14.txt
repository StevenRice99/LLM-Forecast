Title: PAHO and Canada step up efforts to bring COVID-19 vaccines to populations in situations of vulnerability in Latin America and the Caribbean
Publisher: Pan American Health Organization
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article: The Government of Canada and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) have announced a renewed collaboration to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines in Latin America and the Caribbean, with Canada providing an additional C$ 45 million. This collaboration aims to support vaccine delivery, distribution, and confidence, as well as boost regional vaccine production. The announcement comes as the Region of the Americas reported a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths, with over 3.6 million new cases and 18,000 new deaths in the last month. While 70% of the region's inhabitants have completed their primary vaccination schedule, there are still 203 million people who have not received their first dose. The partnership between Canada and PAHO will focus on improving vaccine access for vulnerable populations and strengthening health systems and immunization programs. The funds will also support the implementation of information systems and research initiatives to encourage vaccination and improve surveillance. Since 2021, with Canada's support, PAHO has provided guidance to 28 Member States on developing and rolling out COVID-19 vaccine campaigns that prioritize vulnerable populations. Additionally, PAHO and Canada have helped 22 countries strengthen their cold chain capacity for the safe management and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, improving regular immunization programs and overall health system strength. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vaccination status of the population. The article mentions that while a large proportion of people in the region have completed their primary vaccination schedule, there are still a significant number of people who have not received any doses. This unvaccinated population may be at a higher risk of hospitalization if they contract COVID-19. Additionally, the surge in cases and deaths in the Region of the Americas suggests that the healthcare system could be strained, potentially leading to higher hospitalization rates.

Title: CDC identifies possible safety issue with Pfizer’s updated Covid-19 vaccine but says people should still get boosted
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected a possible safety issue with the bivalent Covid-19 vaccine by Pfizer and BioNTech, specifically an increased risk of ischemic stroke in seniors aged 65 and older who received the booster. The CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) system identified 130 cases of stroke out of approximately 550,000 seniors who received the Pfizer bivalent booster, with no fatalities. However, the CDC notes that the number of strokes is relatively small and may be biased by confounding factors. The same increase has not been detected in other medical records or by other countries using the vaccine. The CDC continues to recommend that people stay up-to-date with Covid-19 vaccines, emphasizing that the risks of Covid-19 for older adults outweigh any possible vaccine risks. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert, supports this, stating that the risk of adverse events, including hospitalization, is much greater with Covid-19 than from the vaccine. The CDC and FDA will continue to evaluate additional data and discuss it at an upcoming meeting.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The Department of Health in New Brunswick has expanded its COVID-19 wastewater monitoring to Fredericton and plans to introduce it in Saint John and Bathurst soon. Wastewater results can provide early warning signs of community infection levels. New Brunswick began COVID-19 wastewater monitoring in June, and Moncton was the first location to be added to the national site in October. The main benefit of this surveillance is the early identification of COVID-19 trends. Moncton's latest seven-day rolling average of the COVID-19 viral load was 29 gene copies per millilitre of raw sewage as of December 29, down from a high of 132 on December 1. COVID-19 wastewater readings can fluctuate due to various factors, including the number of infected individuals in a community and weather conditions such as rain. The surveillance data is reviewed by public health officials and shared with the community to help assess their risk and take appropriate steps to prevent disease transmission.

Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article discusses the results of a survey conducted by McGill researchers to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced food-related decisions and grocery shopping behaviors in a sample of adults from Quebec. Here's a summary, including some key facts that could be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Reduced In-Store Shopping: At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a decrease in the frequency of in-store shopping trips. This shift likely contributed to efforts to minimize physical contact and adhere to pandemic restrictions. Rise in Curbside Pick-up and Delivery: Concurrently, there was an increase in the utilization of curbside pick-up and delivery services for groceries. This trend allowed people to maintain social distancing and avoid crowded stores. Increased Support for Local Businesses: By early 2020, as the pandemic's impact intensified across Canada, survey respondents exhibited a heightened desire to support local food retailers. This trend could have influenced shopping patterns, with more people opting for local grocery options. Emphasis on Food Origin: Additionally, 68% of respondents attached greater importance to the country of origin of food products. This shift in preference may have influenced purchasing decisions and could have impacted the supply chain and availability of certain food items. While the article does not directly provide insights into COVID-19 hospitalizations, these behavioral changes could have indirect effects. For instance, reduced in-store shopping and the preference for local retailers might have contributed to decreased exposure to crowded places, potentially lowering infection risks. However, the impact on hospitalizations would depend on various other factors, including vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, and overall healthcare system capacity.

Title: Reminders for COVID-19 and flu health and safety on campus
Publisher: Toronto Metropolitan University
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article outlines the policies and procedures that a university has put in place to manage COVID-19-related absences for both students and staff. Here are the key points: Students: TMU has extended its special COVID-19 category in the Academic Consideration Request System for the 2022/23 academic year. Students who miss classes or assessments due to cold, flu-like symptoms, or self-isolation can select COVID-19 as the reason without providing documentation once per semester. If a student submits two requests, they will receive a notice with resources and may be contacted by their department. Faculty and Contract Lecturers: Those with minimal COVID-19 symptoms should discuss with their Chair/Director the possibility of temporarily delivering their course remotely. If symptoms prevent them from teaching, regular sick leave policies apply, and a replacement teacher will be arranged. Staff: Staff members experiencing symptoms should follow regular sick leave procedures. Leaders are encouraged to be flexible with employees as absences may increase during the winter months. University Policies: While vaccination and mask mandates are currently paused, the university closely monitors public health guidance and may reinstate masking requirements if needed. The university appreciates the community's efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and flu on campus. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider factors such as vaccination rates, mask adherence, and the prevalence of new variants. The university's policies aim to balance health and safety with academic continuity. The impact of these policies on hospitalizations will depend on various factors, including the overall health of the student and staff population and their adherence to self-isolation and sick leave policies when symptomatic.

Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on couples and families in Canada, based on data from the Canadian Social Survey and the Census of Population. Here is a summary: Impact on Couples and Families: There were 8.6 million married or common-law couples in Canada in 2021. The pandemic appears to have increased disagreements among couples, especially regarding parenting tasks, money, household chores, and having children. 43% of couples with children disagreed about parenting decisions related to the pandemic. 38% disagreed about physical distancing and public health guideline adherence. 20% disagreed about COVID-19 vaccination. Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: While the article does not directly provide data to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the survey data suggests that the pandemic has led to increased stress and disagreements among couples, which could potentially impact mental health and well-being. This, in turn, could influence an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and severity. However, it is important to note that the data is self-reported and may not capture the full complexity of relationship dynamics. Additionally, the data highlights areas of disagreement, such as vaccination status and adherence to public health guidelines, which could provide insights into potential risk factors for COVID-19 transmission and hospitalization. Public health officials can utilize this information to target interventions and communication strategies to these specific areas of disagreement.

Title: A survey of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 23 countries in 2022
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Overall, the article presents a global survey on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and related factors affecting vaccine hesitancy. Here is a summary: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance increased globally from 75.2% in 2021 to 79.1% in 2022 across 23 countries. However, 12% of vaccinated individuals hesitated or refused to receive a booster dose. Younger age groups showed higher booster hesitancy, contrary to previous studies. Lower educational attainment and income were associated with greater hesitancy, consistent with previous findings. Parental hesitancy to vaccinate children under 18 remained high in many high-income and some lowand middle-income countries (LMICs). Misinformation and misrepresentation of COVID-19 vaccines on social media are common, especially in less developed countries. Most respondents supported vaccine mandates for indoor spaces, workplaces, schools, and international travel, but support declined compared to the previous year. The use of ivermectin, an unproven and potentially toxic treatment, was reported as frequently as approved medications, especially in LMICs. Strategies to improve vaccine literacy and address hesitancy include emphasizing compassion over fear, tailoring messages to demographic and psychographic factors, utilizing trusted messengers like healthcare providers, and offering incentives. The study had limitations, including the generalization of various COVID-19 vaccines and potential underrepresentation of vulnerable populations. The most promising finding is the increasing global acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, but efforts are needed to address lingering disparities and pockets of resistance. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following factors can be considered: Vaccine acceptance and coverage: The increase in vaccine acceptance is a positive sign, but the variability in acceptance rates across countries can impact hospitalization rates. Areas with lower vaccine coverage may experience higher hospitalization rates during surges. Booster shot hesitancy: The refusal or delay in receiving booster shots can lead to decreased immunity over time, potentially resulting in more severe infections and hospitalizations. Childhood vaccination: Parental hesitancy to vaccinate children can contribute to lower vaccine coverage in the pediatric population, making them more vulnerable to severe disease and hospitalization during outbreaks. Misinformation and trust: The impact of misinformation and trust issues in official sources can influence vaccine uptake and affect hospitalization rates. Effective communication strategies are crucial to address misinformation and build trust. Mandates and compliance: The decline in support for vaccine mandates may influence hospitalization rates, as mandates have been effective in increasing vaccine coverage and reducing severe disease. Emerging variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can impact hospitalization rates, especially if they evade immune protection provided by vaccines or previous infections. Healthcare system capacity: The capacity and resilience of healthcare systems in different countries can vary, affecting their ability to manage surges in hospitalizations effectively. By considering these factors and monitoring vaccine coverage, hesitancy, and emerging variants, policymakers and public health officials can forecast COVID-19 hospitalization trends and implement targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

Title: Study suggests COVID-19 can cause diabetes
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: A recent study posted to the Research Square server investigates the potential link between COVID-19 and the development of diabetes mellitus (DM). While previous research has suggested an association between COVID-19 and new diabetes diagnoses, the relationship between the two conditions is not yet fully understood. The study, based on data from a global clinical registry, found that COVID-19 patients with no prior history of diabetes presented with high blood glucose levels, indicating potential new-onset diabetes. Out of 537 new diabetes cases from 61 hospitals in 25 countries, 22% of patients with documented HbA1c levels were recently diagnosed with diabetes. Type 2 DM was the most common subtype among adults, while two cases of Type 1 DM were recorded in children. The findings suggest that COVID-19 may cause significant changes in glucose metabolism and have a "diabetogenic effect." This implies that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for diabetes. However, further research is needed to confirm the mechanisms behind the virus's interference with glucose metabolism. It is important to note that this study has not yet been peer-reviewed, and more research is required to establish a direct causal link between COVID-19 and diabetes. Nonetheless, the findings have significant implications for the diagnosis, management, and public health responses to both diseases.
