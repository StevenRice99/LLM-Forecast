Title: Study finds connection between COVID-19 and new-onset AFib
Publisher: American Heart Association
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The research highlights section of the article provides a good summary of the key findings: The study used data from the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry and found that 1 in 20 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 developed new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of irregular heartbeat. New-onset AFib was strongly associated with increased in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients who developed new-onset AFib experienced longer hospital stays, a greater need for ICU care and intubation, and a high in-hospital death rate of approximately 45%. These findings suggest that new-onset AFib in COVID-19 patients is a marker of adverse clinical outcomes and may help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and the need for intensive care. The study highlights the importance of monitoring and managing AFib in COVID-19 patients to improve their chances of recovery and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Title: How the ‘Rise of the Rest’ Became the ‘Rise of the Rents’
Publisher: Bloomberg
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the housing market in the United States, contributing to a deepening housing affordability crisis. The shift to remote work has accelerated the movement of knowledge and tech workers out of expensive coastal hubs and into more affordable areas, driving up housing prices and rents in previously affordable communities across the country, a phenomenon known as "the rise of the rents." This has resulted in a form of pandemic gentrification, spreading the issue of housing affordability from superstar cities to a wider range of locations, including suburbs and rural areas. The pandemic has also likely influenced COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts, as the spread of the virus to less densely populated areas with varying healthcare infrastructure and resources could impact hospitalization rates.

Title: Measuring inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake and intent: results from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2021 - BMC Public Health
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This study examines COVID-19 vaccination coverage and intent among Canadian adults, providing insights into the factors influencing vaccine uptake. As of the study, 89% of Canadian adults had received at least one dose, with only 11% remaining unvaccinated. Significant determinants of vaccine uptake included age, education level, the presence of young children in the household, self-perceived health, and access to a regular healthcare provider. Older adults were more likely to be vaccinated, with a decrease in unvaccinated individuals from 17% in the 18-29 age group to 4% in those over 70. Education played a role, with individuals holding a university degree being more likely to be vaccinated. The presence of children under 12 in the household was associated with a higher risk of being unvaccinated, possibly due to access barriers. Individuals with fair or poor self-perceived health were more likely to be unvaccinated, which could be related to concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness. Having a regular healthcare provider positively influenced vaccine uptake. Regarding vaccination intent, only 5% of the population did not intend to get vaccinated. Lower vaccination intent was associated with region, younger age, lower education level, the presence of children under 12 in the household, being unattached, and poor self-perceived health. Individuals in the Prairies showed higher risks of not intending to get vaccinated. Adults under 40 and between 50-59 had lower vaccination intent than those over 70. Visible minorities were found to be more eager to get vaccinated, possibly due to their representation among healthcare workers. The presence of children under 12 was negatively associated with vaccination intent. Unattached individuals also showed lower vaccination intent. The study highlights the importance of addressing sociodemographic factors to improve vaccine uptake and provides insights for targeted interventions. However, further research is needed to fully understand the contributing factors, especially considering the novelty of COVID-19 vaccines and knowledge gaps among the public.

Title: Understanding the Post COVID-19 Condition (Long COVID) in Adults and the Expected Burden for Ontario
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article provides an overview of the post-COVID-19 condition, often referred to as "long COVID," and its potential impact on healthcare systems in Ontario, Canada. Here is a summary of the key points: Definition: The post-COVID-19 condition encompasses a wide range of symptoms that persist or develop after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection has resolved. There is currently no universally accepted definition, which poses challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Causes: The condition is believed to be primarily related to the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. Emerging evidence suggests a combination of viral and host factors, including viral persistence, persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and coagulopathy, may contribute to the development of the condition. Prevalence: The reported prevalence varies widely due to different definitions and study methodologies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 10-20% of people infected early in the pandemic would develop the condition. More recent data from vaccinated adults show lower rates, with 4.0-5.0% self-reporting symptoms beyond 12 weeks. Symptoms: The post-COVID-19 condition can include a range of symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, as well as neurocognitive manifestations like cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Impact on Healthcare Systems: The condition has significant implications for healthcare systems, including the need for long-term clinical support and the utilization of health system resources for diagnosis and treatment. Knowledge Gaps: There remains uncertainty about the definition, prevalence, causes, risk factors, prevention, and prognosis of the post-COVID-19 condition. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for the diverse range of symptoms and to distinguish them from the effects of critical illness in general. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of the post-COVID-19 condition on healthcare utilization. The varying prevalence rates and the potential for long-term symptoms and complications suggest that healthcare systems should prepare for ongoing COVID-19-related hospitalizations, even as acute infection rates fluctuate.

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses the rollout of British Columbia's fall COVID-19 booster program, which is expected to begin in the coming week. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry encourages everyone aged five and older to receive a booster shot, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups such as healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, Indigenous people, and seniors. The default booster offered will be the Moderna bivalent vaccine, which targets the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Omicron variant BA.1. Dr. Penny Ballem, the executive lead of BC's COVID-19 immunization plan, emphasizes the importance of keeping vaccinations up to date, especially with the start of the new school year. She notes that approximately half of children aged 5-11 in BC have received their first or second dose, and encourages them to take advantage of the booster campaign. Health officials in BC anticipate a spike in COVID-19 and influenza cases in the coming months, and encourage personal responsibility in protecting oneself and others. Dr. Henry does not expect to reintroduce strict public health restrictions, but emphasizes the importance of individual actions such as staying home when sick, wearing masks, hand hygiene, and staying up to date with vaccinations. The fall booster program in BC is expected to reach up to 280,000 people per week, with a focus on vaccine distribution through pharmacies and public health clinics. Individuals are advised to get their COVID-19 booster as soon as it is offered, rather than waiting for the flu vaccine. The article also provides information on how to register for a booster or flu shot through the Get Vaccinated BC program.

The article discusses the story of Franci DuPerron, a resident of Maple Ridge, British Columbia, who lost her mother due to a severe allergic reaction following vaccination against COVID-19. DuPerron's mother received the Moderna vaccine and experienced respiratory distress and unconsciousness within ten minutes of vaccination. Despite the administration of EpiPens, she unfortunately passed away. DuPerron's story highlights her experience with Canada's Vaccine Injury Support Program, which offers compensation for individuals who suffer vaccine injuries. As of June 2021, the program has received 774 claims, with eight approved by the medical review board. DuPerron received compensation but found the process frustrating and lengthy. She emphasizes the rarity of her mother's adverse event, as severe allergic reactions occurred in approximately 2.7 cases per 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine in the U.S. DuPerron herself received the Pfizer vaccine and boosters despite experiencing blood sugar spikes afterward. She plans to get another booster if an alternative to Moderna is available.

Title: New study suggests risk of extreme pandemics like COVID-19 could increase threefold in coming decades
Publisher: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The analysis of infectious disease outbreaks over the past 400 years reveals that the probability of a pandemic with a similar impact to COVID-19 is about 2% in any given year, leading to a 38% chance of experiencing such a pandemic during one's lifetime. The statistics also indicate a high likelihood of another extreme pandemic, similar to the 1918 H1N1 flu, occurring within the next 400 years. The annual probability of extreme epidemics may increase due to climate change, which alters animal habitats and transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne illnesses. The increasing risks emphasize the urgency of developing rapid response mechanisms, improving pandemic surveillance, strengthening healthcare systems, and researching the rising frequency of large outbreaks. These measures are crucial to mitigate the impact of future pandemics and protect global health.

Title: Students returning to campus want the ‘university experience’ missed during COVID-19 — University Affairs
Publisher: University Affairs
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the importance of socialization and activities for students returning to in-person learning on campuses, and how these can impact their well-being and academic achievement. Here are the key points: Universities are implementing COVID-19 safety plans to ensure a safe return to in-person learning, but there is also a need to focus on the "university experience" activities that promote socialization and student well-being. The pandemic has negatively impacted student health, with increased emotional distress, mental health issues, anxiety, and disrupted sleep patterns. Online classes have exacerbated these problems. Socializing with friends, using campus amenities like gyms, and participating in campus clubs are important aspects of the post-secondary experience and can improve student well-being. A survey of 4,812 students in 78 countries revealed that students missed in-person classes, socializing with friends, studying at the library, group study sessions, and campus clubs and organizations. Universities should increase opportunities for socialization, improve on-campus studying options, and provide greater support for student clubs to promote a holistic student experience, especially for those who started their programs after 2020 and may have limited social connections. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of students returning to in-person learning and activities. Increased socialization and group activities may lead to higher transmission rates, which could potentially result in more hospitalizations. However, universities' COVID-19 safety plans, high vaccination rates among students, and improved ventilation and cleaning protocols may help mitigate these risks.

Title: Universities take diverging paths on COVID-19 mask, vaccine mandates
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Universities in Canada are taking different approaches to COVID-19 mandates as students and staff return to campus, with some requiring masks and vaccines, while others have relaxed restrictions. Western University has the strictest measures, mandating medical-grade masks indoors and requiring all students to have three vaccine doses. Most universities in British Columbia have no vaccine or mask requirements, while the University of Toronto only mandates vaccines for residence students. Some universities in the Maritimes and Ontario maintain mask mandates. These varying approaches have sparked concerns among faculty and students, with some believing restrictions are too lax or too strict. Protests against Western University's vaccine mandate occurred on August 27. Studies suggest that mask and vaccine mandates help reduce COVID-19 spread on campuses. The University of Manitoba is keeping its mask mandate, while the University of Winnipeg has made masking optional. University decisions are based on provincial guidelines and community feedback, aiming to protect in-person learning while navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic.
