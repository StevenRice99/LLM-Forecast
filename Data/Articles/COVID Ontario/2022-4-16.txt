Title: Eastern Ontario hospitals short-staffed because of COVID-19 spread
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Hospitals in eastern Ontario are experiencing staff shortages as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and community transmission rises. In Kingston, almost 200 out of 6,000 staff members at the Kingston Health Sciences Centre are off work due to illness or isolation, with community transmission believed to be the main cause. Local coronavirus wastewater levels have also reached record highs in certain areas. The hospital's president and CEO, David Pichora, hopes that no further restrictions will be lifted until healthcare facilities are better equipped to handle the sixth wave. He also encourages community members to continue wearing masks in public places to protect healthcare staff, who are exhausted and overworked. Similar staffing issues are occurring in Ottawa hospitals, with the Ottawa Hospital and Montfort Hospital experiencing challenges due to employees having to isolate or call in sick. The coronavirus wastewater average in Ottawa is significantly higher than previous records. In Pembroke, the CEO of the regional hospital, Pierre Noel, stated that they have been facing critical staffing shortages for weeks, with about 10% of their employees absent on any given day. The highly transmissible nature of the current variant is believed to be a significant factor in the staffing shortages across Ontario's hospital system. As healthcare workers are required to isolate for longer periods, hospitals are struggling to maintain surgical procedures and are having to redeploy staff to critical areas.

Title: Multijurisdictional outbreak of COVID-19 associated with a wake/funeral event in a northern Saskatchewan First Nations community, CCDR 48(4)
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article describes a multijurisdictional outbreak of COVID-19 in two Indigenous communities in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2020. The outbreak was linked to a gathering at a hospital in Alberta and a wake/funeral in a First Nations community in Saskatchewan. The objectives of the investigation were to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak and the chains of transmission, and to inform the hypothesis that there were multiple introductions of COVID-19 at the wake/funeral. A total of 68 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified, with 12 cases in Alberta and 56 in Saskatchewan. The illness onset dates ranged from May 31 to July 1, 2020, and the median age of the cases was 43 years. Five cases were hospitalized, and there were no deaths. The investigation suggested that the hospital visit in Alberta was critical to transmission, with three individuals in their period of communicability during the visit and close contact between the Alberta and Saskatchewan visitors. The wake/funeral in Saskatchewan was also a likely transmission setting, with an attack rate of 31% among the 140 attendees. The available case exposure information supported the hypothesis that there had been multiple introductions of COVID-19 at the wake/funeral. The outbreak was declared over on July 20, 2020, based on two incubation periods following the illness onset of the last primary case. The investigation highlighted the importance of data sharing, coordination across health authorities, and centralized analysis in understanding the events leading to multijurisdictional outbreaks and the possible hypotheses around chains of transmission. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the severity of the cases, the availability of hospital resources, and the impact of public health measures and interventions. In this outbreak, 5 out of 68 cases (7%) were hospitalized, and 1 out of 5 hospitalized cases (20%) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The absence of deaths associated with the outbreak suggests that the hospitalizations were manageable within the healthcare system. However, it is important to monitor the capacity of healthcare facilities and ensure that resources, such as isolation trailers, are available to support adherence to isolation requirements.

Title: The COVID-19 pandemic — what have urologists learned?
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on male fertility and reproductive health. Here is a summary, along with some important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Viral infections, such as mumps, HIV, and hepatitis B, have been extensively studied for their long-term effects on male fertility, with some viruses causing orchitis (testicular inflammation). SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may also affect male fertility due to its ability to bind to ACE2 receptors in the testes. Histopathological studies on deceased men with COVID-19 have shown testicular damage, including interstitial edema, congestion, and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells, suggesting that the testes may be target organs of SARS-CoV-2. Some studies suggest that COVID-19 can affect the testes and epididymis even in non-fatal cases, with incidental epididymitis found in 42% of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and 11% reporting scrotal pain. There is evidence that COVID-19 may impact sperm quality, with oligozoospermia and increased leukocytes observed in patients compared to healthy individuals. The recovery time for sperm quality after COVID-19 infection is estimated to be around 3 months, but further studies are needed to determine if permanent testicular damage occurs in a minority of men. COVID-19 infection is associated with endocrine imbalances, particularly hypogonadism, which may correlate with the severity of the disease. However, these imbalances may also be a result of critical illness in general, rather than specific to COVID-19. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on male fertility are still unclear, with contradictory evidence regarding hormonal imbalances in patients recovering from the disease. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the impact of the virus on male reproductive health, particularly in severe cases that require hospitalization. The reduction in testosterone levels and the incidence of hypogonadism may have implications for overall health and recovery, and could potentially impact hospitalization rates and duration. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on male fertility and endocrine function.

Title: Increased Screen Time for Children and Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts that could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Screen time for children and adolescents has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some studies reporting increases of up to 6.5 hours per day. This exceeds the recommended guidelines of no more than 1-2 hours of screen time per day for children and youth. The first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020 was associated with a sharp increase in screen time for all ages, and this trend has been observed in Ontario as well. Pandemic-related public health measures, such as quarantine, physical isolation, and the switch to online education, have likely contributed to the increase in screen time. Increased screen time is associated with detrimental physical, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. These include depression, unhealthy weight gain, sleep disruption, and increased sedentary behaviors. Demographic and household factors, such as the number of electronic devices in the home, extracurricular activities, bedtime routines, and adverse childhood experiences, can influence screen time and its effects. The nature of screen use, such as active vs passive engagement and the type of technology used, also plays a role in the health outcomes associated with screen time. There is a need for policy interventions and evidence-informed social supports to address the potential negative consequences of increased screen time during and after the pandemic. While the article focuses on the impacts of increased screen time on children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, it does not directly provide information on how these factors could help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the information presented could be useful in understanding the overall health and well-being of this population during the pandemic, which may have indirect effects on healthcare utilization, including hospitalizations.
