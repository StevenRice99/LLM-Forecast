Doctors and nurses in Alberta, Canada, are warning that the province's health system is already under significant strain due to a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations, with internal data showing that the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has surpassed 900 and roughly doubled in a month. This data has not been publicly available for months due to changes in the provincial government's reporting methods. There are concerns that without specific data, it is difficult for Albertans to understand the severity of the COVID-19 situation and its impact on hospitals. Health professionals are calling for more transparency from the government, arguing that it is important for people to be aware of the ongoing threat of COVID-19. The respiratory virus season, including influenza and RSV, has not yet peaked, and doctors warn that when hospitals fill up with patients suffering from these viruses, the entire healthcare system will suffer.

Here is a summary of the article, along with some important points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Summary: The article emphasizes the continued importance of health and safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and the flu. While the university's vaccination and mask mandates are currently paused, the university is monitoring public health guidance and reserves the right to reinstate masking requirements if necessary. The article also provides four key health and safety tips for disease prevention. Important Points for Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: Vaccination and booster status: Vaccination rates and the percentage of the population receiving boosters can impact hospitalization forecasts. Higher vaccination rates generally lead to lower hospitalization rates. Public health measures: The effectiveness of public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, can influence hospitalization forecasts. Reinstating or relaxing these measures will have an effect on hospitalization rates. Variants: The emergence of new COVID-19 variants can impact hospitalization forecasts. New variants may be more transmissible or severe, leading to potential increases in hospitalizations. Healthcare capacity: The current capacity and resources of healthcare systems are crucial for forecasting hospitalizations. If healthcare facilities are already strained, it may lead to increased hospitalizations in the future. Wastewater surveillance: Monitoring wastewater for the presence of COVID-19 can provide early warning signs of increasing infections, which may lead to more hospitalizations. Influenza activity: The flu season can impact COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts. Co-infection or overlapping epidemics may increase the burden on healthcare systems. Community behavior: The adherence to health and safety measures, such as masking and testing, can influence hospitalization rates. The university's emphasis on personal responsibility and community health is crucial for preventing hospitalizations. Public health guidance: Forecasting hospitalizations relies on monitoring and responding to changes in public health guidance. The university's commitment to staying nimble and adapting to future changes is important for managing COVID-19 hospitalizations. It is important to consider these factors when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations and to stay informed about the latest public health recommendations and local regulations.

This article examines trends in physical activity and screen time among Canadian youth from January 2018 to February 2022, providing insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health behaviors. Before the pandemic, nearly half of Canadian youth met the physical activity recommendations, with boys being more active than girls. During the first year of the pandemic, there was a significant drop in physical activity, especially among girls, and a slight recovery in 2021. Overall, girls experienced a larger decline in recreational and active transportation activities compared to boys. Additionally, there was a decrease in the number of youth meeting the screen time recommendations, with more time spent on screens, particularly among girls. The analysis highlights the detrimental effects of the pandemic on youth's physical activity and screen habits, with potential long-term health implications.

Title: How Long It Takes for the COVID-19 Booster To Work

The CDC recommends that everyone who is eligible receive a COVID-19 booster shot to restore any protection that may have faded since their initial vaccination series. While the primary series of vaccines provides a level of protection, a booster shot strengthens the immune response and provides additional protection against COVID-19 and its variants. The booster shot works by re-exposing the immune system to the viral proteins, stimulating the production of memory B cells and increasing the number and quality of antibodies against the virus. The effectiveness of the booster shot starts to increase significantly within the first week and provides a "massive increase in protection" by the second week, according to experts. CDC data from a Pfizer vaccine trial supports this timeline, suggesting that protective effects may begin as early as seven days after the booster dose. However, individual responses may vary, and factors such as age and certain medical conditions can impact the effectiveness of the booster. To maximize the benefits of the booster shot, it is recommended to wait at least two months after the last dose of the primary series before receiving the booster. The longer interval between the original series and the booster dose allows the memory cells to create better antibodies. While the booster shot provides additional protection, it is not a guarantee against infection. Public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, continue to be important tools in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Title: COVID-19 hospitalizations reach numbers not seen since last winter
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising in Canada as the country experiences a wave of autumn infections, according to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). While the numbers are not cause for panic, experts say they should not be ignored, especially with many hospitals already operating at full capacity. The rise in hospitalizations reflects the increase in cases, which totaled 10,218 new infections between October 1 and 7. As of October 10, COVID-19 patients occupied 3,797 hospital beds, the highest occupancy rate since last winter. However, PHAC warns that the data may be incomplete due to inconsistencies in testing, data sources, and reporting. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert, suggests that hospitalization numbers should be contextualized with other data, such as the ratio of ICU to non-ICU patients, which can indicate the severity of a COVID-19 wave. The latest data shows that most of the increase in hospitalizations is due to non-ICU patients, while the number of patients in ICU and on mechanical ventilation has risen modestly. Bogoch also notes that hospitalization data can be inflated by incidental COVID-19 cases, where a positive test is not the primary reason for admission. Both Bogoch and Dr. Michael Curry, a clinical professor of emergency medicine, emphasize that Canadians should not be complacent about COVID-19. Each wave of infections and hospitalizations, regardless of size, strains an already understaffed healthcare system. Curry points out that hospitals in Canada often operate with minimal capacity, leaving them vulnerable during times of increased demand. This has led to the temporary closure of emergency rooms across the country. To help limit the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, individuals are advised to stay up-to-date with vaccinations, practice good hygiene, wear masks in crowded settings, and stay home when sick.

Title: Flu vaccines and the new updated COVID-19 vaccines are available for eligible residents
Publisher: News - KFL&A Public Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
As the winter season approaches, public health officials in the KFL&A region are emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated against both the flu and COVID-19 to protect oneself and loved ones from these respiratory viruses. Getting vaccinated is especially important for high-risk individuals, including those under two years old and over 65 years old, as the flu and COVID-19 can cause severe illness and even lead to hospitalization or death, especially in these vulnerable age groups. The new XBB-targeting COVID-19 vaccine is available and recommended to prevent severe outcomes from COVID-19. With the region still at high risk for COVID-19 and the expectation that the flu will also circulate in the coming months, getting vaccinated is the best way to stay safe. It is safe and recommended to receive both vaccines simultaneously, and they are available at primary care offices and pharmacies. KFL&A Public Health is offering appointments for those under two or over 65, and starting October 30, vaccines will be available to the general public aged six months and older at participating locations. Staying up-to-date with vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and staying home when sick are all important tools to keep the community safe and healthy during the upcoming respiratory virus season.

The table includes the state or region, and the forecasted number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations for the upcoming week. The forecasts are based on data from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, which aggregates predictions from multiple modeling groups to create an ensemble forecast. The specific forecasts vary by state and region, but some overall trends can be observed. For example, in many states, the forecast models predict a decline in hospitalizations over the next week, indicating that the current wave of the pandemic may be peaking or starting to decline in those areas. However, there are also states where hospitalizations are forecasted to remain steady or even increase slightly, suggesting that the impact of COVID-19 continues to vary across the country. The article also includes a brief explanation of the methodology used to create the forecasts, including the types of models used and the data sources. It is important to note that these forecasts are subject to change and should be interpreted as probabilities rather than exact predictions. The further into the future the forecast goes, the less certain it becomes. Overall, this article provides a useful snapshot of expected COVID-19 hospitalizations in the near future, which can help healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals understand the ongoing impact of the pandemic and make informed decisions.
