Title: Toronto, Peel move into COVID-19 lockdown Monday as Ontario tries to stop 'worst-case scenario'
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Ontario, Canada, is experiencing a steep rise in COVID-19 cases, with Toronto and Peel Region moving into lockdown for a minimum of 28 days to curb the spread. The lockdown includes restrictions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, and online instruction for post-secondary institutions. Hospitalizations have increased by 22%, and intensive care admissions by 50%. The province has reported 1,418 new cases and 8 additional deaths, bringing the official death toll to 3,451. To control the surge, the government has imposed fines for violating public health rules and provided relief funding for affected businesses. However, critics argue that the restrictions may not be sufficient, and more targeted measures are needed to strike at the sources of viral spread, such as weddings and religious services. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario has also criticized the decision to keep schools open, citing a lack of data to support the claim that schools are not contributing to the spread.

Title: Fauci says Canada 'getting into trouble' as COVID-19 cases surge worldwide
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert, warns that Canada's COVID-19 situation will worsen until a vaccine is widely available and advises countries to "double down" on public health measures. He attributes the current surge in cases to community spread at the household level, emphasizing the need for widespread testing, including asymptomatic individuals. While promising vaccine results from Pfizer and Moderna show over 90% effectiveness, Fauci cautions against premature celebration. The focus now is on getting vaccines approved and distributed to priority groups by the end of December, with broader availability expected by mid-2021. However, he highlights the challenge of vaccine skepticism and the need to convince a majority of the population to take it. Fauci encourages strict local measures, such as limiting gatherings and shutting down high-risk businesses, to control the virus's spread without imposing nationwide lockdowns. He also acknowledges "COVID fatigue" but urges people to remain vigilant and follow simple public health practices to blunt the surges.

Title: COVID-19 and the beef supply chain: An overview
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian beef supply chain and how it led to panic-buying and price increases for consumers, while ranchers received lower prices for their cattle. The pandemic forced the shutdown of many slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, disrupting the supply chain and causing a backlog of livestock. This resulted in a decrease in slaughter rates and an increase in wholesale purchase prices, as suppliers tried to maintain their margins. Consumer spending shifted from food services to grocery shopping due to social distancing measures, increasing the demand for beef products in retail stores. This, combined with the reduced supply, led to significant increases in beef consumer prices, with a month-over-month increase of 21.6% in June 2020. The article also mentions the influence of other factors, such as climate change and the drop in the Canadian dollar, on meat prices. The article provides an overview of the complex interplay between slaughter rates, cattle prices, wholesale prices, and consumer prices within the beef supply chain. It highlights how disruptions at any point in the supply chain can have cascading effects on prices and availability for consumers. Overall, the pandemic revealed the vulnerabilities in the supply chain and led to concerns about food security and the stability of the industry. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, several factors should be considered: Infection rates: The number of new cases and the rate of transmission in the community affect the likelihood of hospitalizations. Vaccination rates: Higher vaccination rates can reduce the severity of symptoms and the need for hospitalization. Hospital capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units, and medical staff can impact the ability to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients. Demographics: The age and health of the population can influence the risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Public health measures: The effectiveness of public health measures, such as social distancing and mask mandates, can impact infection rates and hospitalizations. By analyzing these factors and using data-driven models, public health officials can forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations and make informed decisions about resource allocation and public health strategies.

Title: Interim report shows results of COVID-19 tests for arriving international travellers
Publisher: Brighter World
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
A recent study of international air travelers arriving in Toronto has yielded promising results that could inform COVID-19 safety policies. Conducted by McMaster HealthLabs (MHL) in partnership with the Canadian government, Air Canada, and the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, the study tested over 8,600 participants at three time points: upon arrival, and again on days 7 and 14. The interim results show that 99% of participants tested negative for COVID-19, with 1% testing positive. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of airport-based testing with self-collected nasal/oral swabs, followed by home-based collection during quarantine. Experts suggest that this testing strategy, combined with a reduced quarantine approach, could help keep borders open and support economic recovery while maintaining public safety. The final report, anticipated to include over 16,000 participants, will provide additional insights into infection rates across different demographics and the psychological impact of quarantine.

Title: U of T alumnus Derrick Rossi 'proud' to play role in promising COVID-19 vaccine: Toronto Star
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine by Moderna, a Cambridge, MA-based company, is attributed to the pioneering research of University of Toronto alumnus Derrick Rossi, who co-founded the company. Rossi's work focused on using modified messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce specific proteins, a technology central to Moderna's vaccine, which preliminary data suggests is 94.5% effective. Rossi, a former Harvard University professor, is no longer with Moderna but feels proud to have contributed to the vaccine's development, which he believes will positively impact human health. The success of the vaccine hinges on its ability to utilize modified mRNA to generate a specific protein, a key factor in protecting against COVID-19 infection and potentially reducing hospitalizations.

Title: Manitoba First Nations lock down, seek help as COVID-19 threatens communities
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the alarming increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths on Manitoba First Nations, leading many communities to implement lockdown measures to protect their vulnerable members. The situation is critical, with hospital intensive care units nearing capacity and healthcare workers warning of potential overload. First Nations people in Manitoba are disproportionately affected by the virus, accounting for a higher percentage of cases, hospitalizations, ICU patients, and deaths compared to their population size. Factors such as overcrowding, poverty, lack of clean water, and underlying health conditions contribute to their increased vulnerability. The federal government has allocated additional funding to support Manitoba First Nations and urban Indigenous communities in their pandemic response efforts. Rapid Response Teams are deployed to assist communities facing outbreaks, providing acute surge support and facilitating rapid testing and isolation to contain the virus spread. Despite efforts by local leaders and healthcare professionals, concerns remain about the effectiveness of current measures in curbing the virus's impact. The call for adherence to public health guidelines and support for Indigenous communities in managing the pandemic is emphasized throughout the article.
