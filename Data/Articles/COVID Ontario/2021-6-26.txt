Title: COVID-19 and Early Childhood Mental Health: Fostering Systems Change and Resilience Policy Brief
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
This policy brief aims to guide decision-makers in supporting the mental health of infants, young children, and their families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature review reveals the pandemic's negative mental health impact on these vulnerable groups, with risks varying across different populations. To build resilience and promote positive mental health, the brief recommends strategic investments in universally accessible, high-quality, and culturally safe mental health and substance use services, as well as early childhood education (ECE). Addressing parenting stress is crucial to preventing adverse outcomes for child development and family well-being. Flexible employment benefits, universal childcare, peer support programs, mental health first aid, and digital early literacy interventions are suggested areas of investment. Adaptations should be made for rural and remote communities, and home visiting, perinatal interventions, and family systems interventions should be expanded. The brief emphasizes that health equity, sexand gender-based analysis, and intersectionality should guide improvements and investments. The pandemic has disproportionately affected women and families experiencing social disadvantage, including racialized, Indigenous, single-parent, and low-income households, as well as those with mental illness or developmental needs. To alleviate the mental health impacts of the pandemic and empower families, providing tailored supports at the appropriate intensity is key. Decision-makers should act on these recommendations to build resilience and mitigate the pandemic's potential long-term effects on early childhood development and family mental health.

Title: The Link Between Myocarditis and COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, has been identified as a rare side effect of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) by the CDC. This condition can also be caused by common viruses, certain medications, and autoimmune diseases, and in rare cases, by vaccine immune responses. While the cause of the vaccine-related myocarditis cases is not yet known, it is considered important but uncommon, occurring in approximately 12.6 cases per million second doses. The majority of these cases have been reported in people under 30, primarily males, and typically after the second vaccine dose. Despite this rare side effect, physicians and the CDC continue to recommend vaccination for everyone eligible, as the benefits of protection against COVID-19 far outweigh the small risk of vaccine-related myocarditis. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to consider the vaccination status of the population. As vaccination rates increase, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are expected to decrease. However, the presence of variants and the effectiveness of vaccines against them will also play a role in hospitalization rates. Monitoring local and regional vaccination rates and variant prevalence can help forecast and manage COVID-19 hospitalizations. Additionally, understanding the capacity and resources of healthcare facilities is crucial for preparedness and managing potential surges.

Title: SickKids reports handful of 'rare' heart inflammation cases following COVID-19 vaccine
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Canada has reported a small number of cases of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer or Moderna). Out of the approximately five patients observed, most did not require admission and responded well to treatment. Despite this, some parents are hesitant to book second dose appointments for their children. Ontario's incoming medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, reassures parents that the vaccines are safe and the province is closely monitoring the situation. Dr. Jacob Udell, a cardiologist, agrees, stating that the risk of myocarditis from the mRNA vaccines is approximately 1 in 100,000, significantly lower than the risk of heart inflammation from a COVID-19 infection. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is also monitoring reports but has not found higher rates of myocarditis or pericarditis than normally expected, and no clear association has been established between the mRNA vaccines and these conditions.

Title: The impact of the pandemic on the downtown areas of Canada’s six major cities
Publisher: PwC
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on downtown city centers in Canada, particularly in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, and Ottawa. The loss of workers, tourists, and students has resulted in fewer customers for local businesses, contributing to a decline in the vitality and attractiveness of these areas. Additionally, the acceleration of trends such as remote working, video conferencing, distance learning, e-commerce, and urban sprawl may have long-term effects on downtown areas. To prevent a cycle of urban decay and economic decline, action is needed to preserve the vitality of Canadian city centers. The impact of the pandemic on each of the six cities mentioned is likely to be unique, reflecting the specific characteristics and dependencies of each downtown core. For example, Toronto and Vancouver, as global cities, may be more susceptible to declines in business travel and tourism, whereas Calgary and Edmonton may be more affected by the shift to remote work and the decline in downtown office workers. Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by Canadian downtown city centers during the pandemic and the potential for long-term transformation.

Title: Economic impacts of COVID-19 in the provinces and territories
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The table presents two indices, the PCA (principal component analysis)-based index, and the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-based index, for several Canadian provinces and territories. These indices likely relate to COVID-19 hospitalizations or a factor influencing them. Here is a summary: Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Northwest Territories have "not available" entries for both indices, indicating a lack of data for comparison. Most provinces and territories have negative values for the PCA-based index, suggesting a potential decrease in hospitalizations or the influencing factor. The range of values varies significantly, from -25.0 in Alberta to -4.8 in the Northwest Territories. In contrast, the LASSO-based index shows a mix of positive and negative values. Alberta has the lowest value at -13.0, while Manitoba has the highest at 4.2. The PCA-based index might carry more weight in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations as it considers multiple variables and their correlations. The LASSO-based index is also useful as it selects variables with stronger relationships to the outcome. Overall, the table suggests varying trends across Canada, with some provinces potentially experiencing decreases in hospitalizations or related factors, while others might see increases or stable situations. However, without additional context and specific dates, it is challenging to make definitive interpretations or forecasts.

Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Jaime Vargas, a 53-year-old man from Scarborough, Ontario, Canada, thought he just had a cough but then collapsed in his driveway and was rushed to the hospital. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was in critical condition, with a 30% chance of survival according to doctors. Vargas's wife, Yolande December, refused to accept the possibility of a negative outcome and maintained her optimism throughout his 50-day coma. Despite being placed in a coma and suffering from pneumonia and collapsed lungs, Vargas made a miraculous recovery, inspiring hospital staff. He is now undergoing rehabilitation and is expected to make a full recovery. This article highlights the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, where even careful individuals like Vargas can contract the virus. It also showcases the dedication and empathy of healthcare workers and the importance of maintaining a positive mindset during challenging times. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the unpredictability of the virus and the varying levels of severity in patients. Factors such as age, pre-existing health conditions, and individual immune responses play a role in the likelihood and duration of hospitalization. Additionally, the availability of medical resources, including hospital beds, intensive care units, and ventilators, can impact the ability to manage COVID-19 cases effectively.

Title: Strategies to Support Ontarians’ Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for COVID-19 Vaccination
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
This article provides insights into the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Ontario, Canada, as of June 2021. The key message is that while most Ontarians want to get vaccinated, there are still barriers to vaccine uptake that need to be addressed. The article identifies capability, opportunity, and motivation as key drivers of behavior and suggests that behavioral science-informed strategies can help overcome these barriers. As of June 12, 2021, over 7 million Ontarians (51%) had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and over 1 million (12%) had received two doses. However, vaccination intention varies across the province, with lower rates in certain demographic groups such as racialized communities and those with lower incomes. The article identifies the following barriers to vaccine uptake: lack of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, mistrust in the government and health institutions, access issues (time, location, cost), and concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. It also highlights enablers such as disease-specific guidance on vaccination safety and recommendations from healthcare providers. To address these barriers and increase vaccine uptake, the article suggests several strategies: 1. Clarify how vaccines were developed and approved quickly and safely, addressing concerns about the speed of development and safety. 2. Build social norms by showing people that similar others are getting vaccinated and leveraging trusted sources, such as healthcare professionals and community leaders. 3. Recognize and address medical mistrust, especially in marginalized communities with collective histories of medical malpractice. 4. Use effective risk communication tools to clarify the risks and severity of COVID-19 and vaccine side effects, being transparent about what is known and what is still being evaluated. 5. Consider incentives and rewards that align with people's personal values and priorities, such as linking vaccination to the reopening of society and the ability to socialize. By implementing these strategies, Ontario can accelerate its race to maximize immunity and support a post-pandemic province.

Publisher: Queen's University
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Dr. Setareh Ghahari, an Associate Professor in the School of Rehabilitation Therapy, is conducting a study to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on newcomers to Canada, including immigrants, refugees, and undocumented individuals. The study aims to collect data on food security, employment, and general health among these populations. Initial findings suggest that newcomers face challenges such as housing insecurity, language barriers, and concerns for loved ones back in their countries of origin. These factors contribute to social isolation and limited access to critical information and services. Dr. Ghahari's research highlights the unique struggles of marginalized groups and aims to inform policies and increase support for newcomers, who make up one-fifth of the Canadian population. The study's results will be presented to the public and policymakers to advocate for improved funding for settlement organizations and to ensure that the voices and needs of newcomers are included in the Canadian narrative. This research is significant as it sheds light on the specific challenges faced by marginalized communities during the pandemic and has the potential to shape policies that provide tangible support for these vulnerable groups.
