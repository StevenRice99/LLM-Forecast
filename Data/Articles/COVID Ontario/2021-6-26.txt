Title: How COVID-19 exposed long-term health-care issues at Brampton hospital
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Based on the article, here are some ways that Brampton Civic Hospital pivoted to conserve critical nursing resources:
1. Developed expertise in prone positioning: The hospital's staff developed expertise in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients by placing them in the prone position, which is believed to improve lung function.
2. Reduced time spent in prone position: To prevent pressure sores, the hospital limited the amount of time patients were left on their stomachs to 16 hours or less.
3. Flipped patients quickly and efficiently: The team developed a system where they would perform the flipping procedure back-to-back, minimizing the time spent at the bedside and reducing the risk of staff exposure to COVID-19.
4. Coordinated transfers with other hospitals: When overwhelmed, the hospital coordinated transfers of critically ill patients to other hospitals, using the GTA Hospital Incident Management System (IMS).
5. Prioritized resource allocation: By transferring less critical patients or those who didn't require prone positioning, the hospital was able to conserve critical nursing resources for more severe cases.
These measures helped the hospital manage the surge in critically ill COVID-19 patients and conserve valuable nursing resources during a critical period.
