High-risk groups: The article defines high-priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination, including seniors, younger adults with significant comorbidities, and immunocompromised individuals. 3. Booster recommendations: The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends booster shots for high-risk Canadians this spring, while healthy, fully vaccinated individuals who have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine booster can skip the spring vaccination campaign. 4. Hybrid immunity: The article mentions that hybrid immunity, achieved through vaccination and previous infection, is proving to be stable in preventing severe disease. 5. Current trends: Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam notes that hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths have stabilized in Canada, and the current trend suggests that there may not be any major waves in the coming months.

Researchers testing wastewater from municipalities across Ontario to measure the prevalence of COVID-19 in seven regions. 3. The importance of wastewater testing findings and the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 as crucial pieces of information to understand the virus' prevalence in the community. 4. Collaboration across 13 universities and several research institutes to expand the surveillance network for monitoring other pathogens like the influenza virus. 5. The program providing valuable data to health units and municipalities to respond effectively to the virus and implement actions or interventions to prevent the spread of outbreaks and reduce infections.

The article suggests that ageism may be a factor in the lack of effort to prevent COVID-19, as older adults are disproportionately affected. The article highlights the importance of booster shots and vaccination in protecting older adults and the community as a whole. The article also notes that better testing and policy decisions could help reduce the number of infections and protect vulnerable populations. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Age distribution of the population, particularly the proportion of older adults. Vaccination rates, particularly among older adults. Number of outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Hospitalization rates, particularly among older adults. Policy decisions and public health measures to prevent COVID-19 transmission.
