Title: Why people may be forgetting their COVID pandemic memories
Publisher: ABC News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the phenomenon of people forgetting about the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it had on their lives. Experts suggest that this is not just due to the passage of time, but also because of the way our brains process traumatic events and the monotony of daily life during the pandemic. Neuroscientists and psychiatrists believe that we may be trying to forget traumatic memories of the pandemic to protect ourselves from the emotional toll it has taken. As vaccines and boosters have reduced hospitalizations and deaths, it is easier to forget the severity of the virus when it first emerged. The monotony of daily life during the pandemic, with remote work and limited travel, also contributed to forgetfulness. Routines became similar, and the lack of change in scenery made events indistinguishable from one another. In addition, infectious disease experts suggest that there is an element of pandemic fatigue, with people eager to move on after having their lives disrupted for three years. This may lead to forgetting how deadly the first years of the pandemic were before vaccines were widely available. However, the article also highlights that there are some people who may never be able to forget the pandemic, such as those who lost loved ones or were seriously ill themselves. It also mentions the millions of people living with long COVID, still struggling with the impact of the virus on their daily lives. Overall, the article provides insight into the psychological and social factors that contribute to forgetting about the COVID-19 pandemic, while also emphasizing the ongoing impact on those who continue to suffer from its effects. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, experts can look at various factors, including vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, and the implementation of public health measures. While the availability of vaccines and boosters has significantly reduced hospitalizations and deaths, new variants can still emerge and pose a threat. Additionally, the relaxation of public health measures can impact the spread of the virus and subsequent hospitalizations.

The article discusses the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, between humans and animals. It mentions that while some coronaviruses infect only animals, others like SARS-CoV-2 can spread from humans to animals. Various animals, including companion animals like cats and dogs, animals in zoos, mink on mink farms, and wildlife, have been documented to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after contact with COVID-19 positive individuals. The risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered low, with only a few reported cases of animals transmitting the virus to humans. The article emphasizes the importance of studying how the virus spreads between people and animals to prevent potential mutations and new strains. Additionally, it mentions that there is currently no evidence that mink play a significant role in spreading COVID-19 to humans.

Title: Consequences of changing Canadian activity patterns since the COVID-19 pandemic include increased residential radon gas exposure for younger people
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article examines the demographic characteristics of a cohort of Canadian adults and their human activity patterns before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study population included adults enrolled in the 'Evict Radon National Study', with a focus on understanding the impact of the pandemic on time spent in different environments and residential radon exposure. Here is a summary of the key points from the article: Demographic characteristics: The study cohort included a diverse group of adults in terms of employment status, sector of employment, job type, gender, age, household composition, community type, household income, and year of residence construction. Human activity patterns: Participants reported an average of ~4.5 workdays per week, with the highest number of workdays in spring and fall and the lowest in summer. Before the pandemic, time spent in non-residential buildings was highest during workdays, while time spent in the primary residence was lowest in summer. After the onset of the pandemic, there was a 10.6% increase in the time spent in the primary residence, resulting in an additional 1062 hours per year. Radiation doses from residential radon: The geometric mean radon level of the study group was 105.3 Bq/m3. There was a 19.2% relative increase in radiation dose rates from residential radon after the onset of the pandemic, equivalent to an additional 0.97 mSv/y. Impact of demographics on radon exposure: The greatest increases in radon exposure were observed among younger individuals (aged 18-54), those with minors at home, individuals in work, higher household income groups, residents of urban or suburban areas, and those living in newer residences. Combinatorial trends: The impact of age, gender, employment status, and the presence of minors on radon exposure were explored. The combination of decreased age and being in work had a significant impact on higher radiation dose rates. Additionally, people living in urban or suburban areas and those with higher household incomes experienced greater increases in radon exposure after the pandemic. This study provides valuable insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's activity patterns and their exposure to residential radon gas. The findings suggest that certain demographic groups may be at higher risk of increased radon exposure due to changes in their activity patterns during the pandemic. This information can be used to inform public health interventions and radon mitigation strategies.

Trusted: True
Posted: 2 days ago
Most people with COVID-19 can recover at home by staying hydrated, resting, and using over-the-counter medication for symptoms like cough and fever. A humidifier or hot shower can also help soothe symptoms. For more severe or persistent symptoms, individuals can call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1 to speak to a nurse in their language. This information is valuable for forecasting hospitalizations as it suggests that only those with worsening or persistent symptoms may require medical attention beyond home care, which could help predict the number of hospitalizations and the strain on healthcare resources.

Title: JILA’s Frequency Comb Breathalyzer Detects COVID-19 With Excellent Accuracy
Publisher: NIST
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
A team of researchers from NIST/JILA, led by fellows Jun Ye and David Nesbitt, have developed a breathalyzer that can accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in human breath. This technology, based on frequency-comb technology and machine learning, has been tested on 170 volunteer subjects, with a median age of 23 years old, from the University of Colorado Boulder, with half of the participants testing positive for COVID-19 through standard PCR tests. The frequency-comb technology, which won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2005, can precisely measure different colors of light, including infrared light absorbed by molecules in human breath. When combined with machine learning, this technique can identify specific combinations of molecules that indicate the presence of diseases. The breathalyzer has demonstrated excellent accuracy in detecting COVID-19, with an "area under the curve" (AUC) value of 0.849, which is considered "excellent" for medical diagnostic data. The breathalyzer was also able to identify discriminating molecules for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including water, semi-heavy water, formaldehyde, ammonia, methanol, and nitrogen dioxide. This technology has the potential to non-invasively diagnose a wide range of health conditions faster and more accurately than current methods. The researchers plan to further improve the accuracy and portability of the breathalyzer and seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use. This innovative breathalyzer technology, with its potential for early and accurate disease detection, holds promise for revolutionizing healthcare and improving patient outcomes, especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: COVID-19 screeners removed from hospitals, Alberta closes PCR testing centres
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The Alberta government has announced changes to its COVID-19 measures, signaling a shift to the "endemic phase" of the virus. As part of this transition, Alberta Health Services (AHS) has closed its 17 coronavirus testing facilities and ended coronavirus screening at hospitals and other AHS facilities. The Health Minister, Jason Copping, stated that the province is now treating COVID-like other respiratory viruses. AHS's assessment found that screening is no longer necessary, and the masking policy is also under review. Dr. Noel Gibney, a professor emeritus of critical care medicine, supports the changes given the current COVID-19 situation in Alberta, noting a significant drop in hospitalization numbers. According to the latest data, 465 Albertans are hospitalized with the virus, with 25 in intensive care. Dr. Gibney also mentions that many Albertans have "moved on" from the pandemic. The changes will also help with staffing issues, allowing AHS to reassign staff from screening duties to patient care responsibilities. AHS staff will continue to wear masks in areas with patient contact to protect vulnerable populations. While the level of concern about COVID has decreased, Dr. Gibney emphasizes the importance of continuing to protect high-risk groups. High-risk Albertans, including seniors and adults with specific immuno-compromising conditions, are now eligible for additional COVID booster doses.

Title: A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Scientists in Germany have developed a nasal vaccine that successfully prevented COVID-19 infection in hamsters. This vaccine uses a live but weakened form of the coronavirus, achieving "sterilizing immunity" by blocking the virus from replicating in the upper airways. While this vaccine still needs to pass further tests before being approved for human use, it offers a promising approach to preventing COVID-19 infections. The advantage of nasal vaccines lies in their ability to boost mucosal immunity, strengthening the immune defenses in the tissues lining the upper airways, where the virus typically enters the body. This type of vaccine can station immune responses directly at the site of infection, acting like firefighters underneath a smoke alarm. The German vaccine uses a technique called codon pair deoptimization, manipulating the virus's genetic material to make it harder for cells to translate, essentially confusing the immune system without causing sickness. In hamster studies, this vaccine created a stronger immune response compared to mRNA or adenovirus-based vaccines. However, vaccine experts caution that further testing is needed, and the study authors agree. The vaccine was tested against the original strain of the coronavirus, and while it still performed better against the Omicron variant, its ability to neutralize the virus was reduced. Clinical trials in humans are planned, and the researchers are awaiting data from similar vaccines in development by other groups. Despite progress, challenges remain, including the need for significant funding and public perception that the vaccine race is over. Dr. Greg Poland emphasizes the need for a pan-coronavirus vaccine that induces mucosal immunity and is long-lasting. At least four nasal vaccines have reached late-stage testing, including two that are completing human studies. While live attenuated vaccines have proven potent for other diseases, there are considerations for their use in vulnerable populations with compromised immunity.

Title: Ageism and the pandemic: How Canada continues to let older adults suffer and die from COVID-19
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Despite the majority of Canadians foregoing masks and booster shots, COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of death in Canada, particularly among older adults. The article argues that this is a result of ageism and a failure to recognize the value and contribution of older individuals to society. COVID-19 is now the second-leading cause of hospitalization in Canada and the leading cause for those over 50. The author emphasizes that COVID-19 is a vaccine-preventable disease, but many Canadians, especially the younger population, are not keeping up with their booster shots. This not only puts older adults at risk but also strains the healthcare system and caregivers. The article highlights the impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities, with more outbreaks, deaths, and hospitalizations in 2022 than in the previous two years combined. Yet, many COVID-19 research programs are winding down, which the author finds unacceptable given the ongoing toll of the disease. Older adults are more likely to have other health issues, and COVID-19 can trigger a spiral of health problems leading to premature death. The high proportion of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities is attributed to Canada's failure to prioritize infection prevention. With the aging population, the demand for long-term care is rising, and outbreaks continue in these facilities. The article calls for better testing and vaccination rates to reduce infections and protect vulnerable populations. It emphasizes that older adults deserve to live long and healthy lives and that their inherent value and dignity should be recognized and respected. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the vaccination rates, particularly among the elderly and vulnerable populations, and the adherence to public health measures such as masking and social distancing. The impact of new variants and the availability of treatments and resources in the healthcare system will also play a role in future hospitalization rates.
