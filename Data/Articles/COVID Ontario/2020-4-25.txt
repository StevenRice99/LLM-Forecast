Title: Young and middle-aged people, barely sick with covid-19, are dying of strokes
Publisher: The Washington Post
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the link between COVID-19 and stroke, particularly in young and middle-aged adults. Several cases are presented where individuals in their 30s and 40s with no underlying health conditions or risk factors experienced severe strokes while infected with COVID-19. This is unusual as the median age for this type of stroke is typically 74. The article also highlights the observations of medical professionals, such as Thomas Oxley, an interventional neurologist, who noticed the formation of new clots in real time around an existing clot during a procedure. The article mentions that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory pathogen but can impact almost every major organ system in the body. It is suspected that strokes in COVID-19 patients may be a consequence of blood clotting problems, which can also lead to pulmonary embolisms and heart attacks. This is supported by observations from Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals and NYU Langone Health in New York City, where 12 patients with COVID-19 treated for large blood blockages in their brains were found to have the virus, with 40% being under 50 and presenting few or no risk factors. The article also includes a statement from J. Mocco, a physician-researcher at Mount Sinai, who noted that during the three weeks of the COVID-19 surge, the number of patients with large blood blockages in their brains doubled, with more than half testing positive for COVID-19. These patients were also significantly younger than typical stroke patients, with an average age difference of 15 years. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of seeking urgent medical attention if individuals experience stroke symptoms, as large strokes are very treatable if addressed quickly, ideally within six hours. Key points to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations related to strokes: COVID-19 has been linked to an increased risk of strokes, even in young and otherwise healthy individuals. The formation of blood clots is a significant complication of COVID-19 and can lead to severe and deadly strokes. There has been an observed increase in hospitalizations for large blood blockages in the brain during the COVID-19 surge. The average age of COVID-19 stroke patients is significantly lower than typical stroke patients. Seeking immediate medical attention for stroke symptoms is crucial, as early treatment significantly improves outcomes.

Title: Canadians report lower self-perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Statistique Canada
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
The article examines the self-perceived mental and physical health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on comparing the mental health of women and men and different age groups. The data was drawn from two sources: the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (CPSS), and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2018. Key findings include: 54% of Canadians aged 15 and older reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 period, compared to 68% in 2018. Women were more likely to report poorer mental health compared to men, with 49% of women rating their mental health as excellent or very good compared to 60% of men. All age groups, except individuals aged 65 and older, were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 period. The difference was more pronounced among younger adults. 69% of Canadians reported excellent or very good physical health during the COVID-19 period, compared to 60% in 2018. The results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of Canadians, particularly women and young people. Researchers suggest that mental health interventions, including digital and tele-mental health resources, may be needed to address the mental health needs of the population during the pandemic.

On March 23, 2020, Premier Doug Ford ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses for 14 days. Ontario extended the state of emergency multiple times throughout April and May, gradually reopening businesses and outdoor amenities. On May 14, 2020, Ford announced the first stage of the province's reopening plan, allowing some businesses to resume operations with restrictions. By June 2020, Ontario started to enter Stage 2 of its recovery plan, with some regions progressing faster than others. On July 29, 2020, Toronto and Peel Region were allowed to move to Stage 3, the final stage of the reopening plan. On September 15, 2020, Ontario reported 251 new cases, a significant increase from previous days. The province continued to adjust gathering limits and restrictions based on case numbers and public health advice. The timeline also mentions the impact on schools, with the government announcing plans for the return to classrooms in September. These milestones and government responses provide a context for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. The data on case numbers, outbreaks, and the impact on healthcare facilities can inform predictions and help public health officials make informed decisions to manage the pandemic.

Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses a research project led by Dr. Stephen Freedman, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, that aims to understand how the COVID-19 virus impacts children. The project is one of 99 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Rapid Research projects funded by the CIHR (Canadian Institutes of Health Research). The study, "Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Children Potentially Infected by SARS-CoV-2 Presenting to Pediatric Emergency Departments," plans to enroll and follow 12,500 children over several months who present to 58 participating emergency departments in 14 countries. Recruitment has already started in Canada and worldwide. The study will include children who test positive and negative for COVID-19 to compare exposures, interventions, and collect outcome data from those with respiratory illnesses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The research team will follow the children for 90 days after their visit to a pediatric emergency department to look at chronic symptoms that may develop due to the infection or related stress. One of the main goals of the project is to share data with policymakers in real time through an electronic database that can be accessed by the public, academics, and policymakers. The team is currently building the electronic data capture tool and expects to start analyzing the data within the next few weeks, hoping to identify high-risk periods for children, similar to what has been observed in adults.

Title: The impact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) on global poverty: Why Sub-Saharan Africa might be the region hardest hit
Publisher: World Bank
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article estimates that COVID-19 will push an additional 40-60 million people into extreme poverty worldwide, with a best estimate of 49 million. Nowcasting global poverty is challenging due to the need to make assumptions about growth forecasts and their impact on the poor, as well as complications in calculating poverty for countries with limited or outdated data. The estimate of the impact of COVID-19 on global poverty is based on household survey data and growth projections for 166 countries, assuming that growth accrues equally to everyone within a country. The World Economic Outlook projects a 3% contraction in global output in 2020 due to the pandemic, which is used to extrapolate poverty data forward from the latest available estimates in PovcalNet, a World Bank tool for estimating global poverty.
