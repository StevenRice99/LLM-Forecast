TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Key metrics for forecasting hospitalizations: + Hospitalization rate: stable in Ottawa, with 37 people being treated in hospital for COVID-19, including 10 in the intensive care unit. + Case numbers: 54 new cases reported in Ottawa, bringing the total to 857 laboratory-confirmed cases. + Outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes: 19 current outbreaks in Ottawa. + Physical distancing measures: still necessary to prevent a surge in infections, as 99% of the population is still not immune. These values suggest that while hospitalizations may have stabilized, there is still a risk of increased transmission in vulnerable settings, and continued physical distancing measures are necessary to prevent a surge in infections.
