Publisher: Policy Options
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here's a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
The article presents an alternative strategy to population-wide lockdowns, known as "heterogeneous mitigation", which targets high-risk populations while keeping low-risk populations normal. This approach aims to minimize hospital overcrowding by shifting the age-profile of infections towards younger groups and away from older populations who are at higher risk.
Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Age group distribution of infections (e.g., 51-63% reduction in mortality among high-risk populations)
Hospitalization rates by age group
Effectiveness of targeted measures to reduce virus transmission rates among high-risk populations
Potential impact on herd immunity development and COVID-19 circulation

Article 8 of 10
Title: Hospital Payments and the COVID-19 Death Count
Publisher: FactCheck.org
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
This article discusses the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death counts in the United States.
Key Points: 
1. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses a combination of symptoms and diagnostic tests to determine whether someone has COVID-19.
2. The CDC notes that there is a possibility of false negative results, which can lead to under-counting of cases and deaths.
3. Experts suggest that there may be both instances of under-counting and over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
4. The initial allocation of $30 billion from the $100 billion fund to help providers was based on prior Medicare business, rather than the number of COVID-19 cases in each state.
5. A Kaiser Health News analysis found that hospitals in states less affected by the pandemic received more funding per reported COVID-19 case compared to those in states heavily affected.
Specific Statements: 
"The possibility of a false negative result should especially be considered if the patient’s recent exposures or clinical presentation indicate that COVID-19 is likely..."
"...experts have previously told us that while it's true that some deaths attributed to COVID-19 likely would have occurred regardless of the disease, other factors — like the deaths of undiagnosed COVID-19 victims, including those that occur at home — contribute to a more significant problem of under-counting the deaths."
"Jensen said he actually believed there could be both instances of under-counting and over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths..."
Sources: 
The article cites interviews with experts, including Robert Berenson from the Urban Institute, Scott Jensen from Minnesota State Senate, Gerald Kominski from UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, Larry Levitt from Kaiser Family Foundation, Karyn Schwartz from Kaiser Family Foundation, as well as various government reports and news articles.

Article 10 of 10
Title: Early signs suggest race matters when it comes to COVID-19. So why isn't Canada collecting race-based data?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Ontario's approach to combating COVID-19 does not account for racial disparities.
The province prioritizes elderly, people with underlying conditions, and those with compromised immune systems, but does not consider race-based data.
Advocates argue that this omission leads to health disparities going unnoticed.
Alberta has acknowledged the need to collect race-based data.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Elderly population
People with underlying conditions (e.g., chronic diseases)
Presence of compromised immune systems
