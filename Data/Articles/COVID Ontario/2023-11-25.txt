This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 numbers are mostly stable, with a high amount of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity and low flu numbers. The average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 is 69, with three patients in an ICU. The city's weekly average test positivity rate is about 17%, which is considered high. There are 34 active COVID outbreaks, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The health unit reported 285 more COVID cases in the last week and six more COVID deaths. The Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) is in a high-risk time for COVID, with high wastewater readings and a very high test positivity rate of 29%. Hospitalizations are high in the EOHU, with 27 COVID hospitalizations, and in the Kingston area, with 21 active COVID-19 patients in hospitals. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada may remain high or even increase in the coming weeks, especially in the Eastern Ontario Health Unit and the Kingston area.
