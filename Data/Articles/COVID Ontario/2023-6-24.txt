Publisher: Oakville News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Oakville's rate of new active cases remains steady, while Halton's new cases are down by 25%. Hospital admissions are down from last week, with 3 people hospitalized in Halton (down from 6 last week). Milton is the only municipality with an ongoing outbreak, which is contributing to the decrease in new cases. Vaccination rates in Halton are low, with only 8% of residents having a full series of immunization, and 4% of those 50 and under being fully immunized. Ontario is no longer providing regular updates on COVID-19 data, but as of April 15, 2023, there were 812 people in hospital with COVID-19 and 80 people in ICU. Canada has had 4.56 million cumulative cases of COVID-19, with 2,504 people currently in hospital and 50,526 deaths to date. The article suggests that vaccination rates, outbreak locations, and hospitalization numbers are important factors to consider when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 trends are mostly low and stable or dropping, with 9 active outbreaks and 5 hospitalizations (with no patients in ICU). The average coronavirus wastewater reading in Ottawa is low and slowly dropping, with one of the lowest readings this year. The number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 is stable at 5, with no patients in ICU. The city's weekly average test positivity rate remains stable around 9%. There have been 46 more COVID cases in the last week and 2 COVID deaths in Ottawa. Across the region, the average COVID-19 test positivity is about 3% in Renfrew County, 6% in the Kingston area, and 21% in the Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU). There are 9 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Eastern Ontario communities outside Ottawa, with 1 patient in intensive care in the EOHU. Western Quebec has 11 hospital patients with COVID, with none in intensive care. These values suggest a stable or decreasing trend in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa and surrounding areas, which could inform forecasting models. However, the article also notes that threats remain, and experts recommend continued caution and vaccination efforts to protect vulnerable populations.

Title: Artificial intelligence-driven prediction of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death: a systematic review
Publisher: Frontiers
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article discusses a systematic review of 39 studies that used artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. The studies were published between 2019 and 2022 and used various AI models, including Random Forest, which was the most commonly used model. The studies were trained on cohorts of individuals sampled from populations of European and non-European countries, with most studies having a cohort sample size of less than 5,000. The article highlights the following values that are most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 1. Use of Random Forest as the best-performing model. 2. Importance of internal validation with cross-validation. 3. Need for external validation and calibration. 4. Use of ensemble approaches to prioritize covariates. 5. Moderately good performances with Area under the Receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) values >0.7. However, the article also notes that the studies had a high risk of bias and/or concern regarding applicability, which is a limitation that should be considered when interpreting the results. Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the use of AI techniques for predicting COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality, which can be applied to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
