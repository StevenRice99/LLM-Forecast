Here is a summary of the article: Researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that wearing a face mask may have an additional benefit beyond protecting against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The study, led by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), discovered that face masks significantly increase the humidity of inhaled air, which could help to reduce the severity of respiratory diseases like COVID-19. The study tested four common types of masks and found that all of them increased the humidity level, with the thick cotton mask leading to the most significant increase. Higher humidity can improve the immune system's defense mechanisms against viruses and help prevent respiratory infections. The increased humidity inside the mask may be one reason why wearing masks has been associated with less severe COVID-19 infections. Earlier studies by the same group also showed that cloth masks effectively block saliva droplets released during speech, providing further evidence for the importance of mask-wearing in combating COVID-19. The research highlights that even with the rollout of vaccinations, mask-wearing remains a crucial measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, especially during winter when respiratory infections are more common.

Title: Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Powell River News and Information
Publisher: Powell River Peak
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist imprisoned in China for her coverage of the early COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, has been released after serving a four-year sentence for "provoking trouble." She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced in December of that year. Her release comes as the Chinese government rolls back strict COVID-19 restrictions, and it may signal a shift in the government's approach to managing the pandemic. Zhang's imprisonment had drawn international criticism, and her health had severely deteriorated during her time in prison due to a hunger strike she undertook to protest her treatment. In her video statement, Zhang expressed gratitude to those who had supported her and said she planned to recover before considering her next steps. As for COVID-19 hospitalizations, forecasting, and important facts: Zhang's release does not provide direct information on hospitalization rates or forecasts. However, her early reporting and the conditions of her imprisonment provide context on the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan and the Chinese government's response. Zhang's reporting from Wuhan, which included interviews with residents and footage from hospitals, offered valuable insights into the situation on the ground during the initial outbreak. Her work highlighted the impact on individuals and the local community, providing a perspective that differed from the official narrative. During her imprisonment, Zhang's health issues, including a hunger strike, brought attention to the harsh conditions faced by those detained during China's crackdown on COVID-19-related dissent. Her release may indicate a shift in the government's approach as it relaxes its zero-COVID policy, which could have implications for hospitalization rates and forecasting. Currently, with the rollback of strict restrictions, there are concerns about a potential surge in cases and hospitalizations. However, it's challenging to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations accurately, especially given the changing nature of the virus and the varying responses by different governments. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, factors such as vaccination rates, the prevalence of new variants, the availability and effectiveness of treatments, and the behavior of the population (such as mask-wearing and social distancing) must be considered. The availability and capacity of healthcare resources also play a significant role in determining hospitalization rates. In conclusion, while Zhang Zhan's release does not directly provide forecasts or figures, it serves as a reminder of the importance of transparent and independent reporting on the COVID-19 situation, particularly in light of changing government policies and the ongoing evolution of the virus. Accurate forecasting of hospitalizations requires a multitude of factors to be taken into account, and the impact of policy changes on hospitalization rates bears continued observation.

Title: Research News: Dialysis patients at greater risk of dying from COVID-19 infection
Publisher: Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The research highlights that patients in Ontario with chronic kidney conditions who require dialysis are at a significantly higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. The study found that of the 12,000 patients on long-term dialysis, 187 got infected with COVID-19 between March and August 2020, with a 60% hospitalization rate and a 30% mortality rate, nearly four times higher than the general population. As of January 2021, a further 424 dialysis patients were diagnosed, with a total of 130 deaths. The researchers also found that patients undergoing dialysis at hospitals were at greater risk of infection compared to those doing it at home. The study emphasizes the need to prioritize dialysis patients for vaccination and encourage at-home dialysis to reduce COVID-19 exposure. This information is vital for forecasting hospitalizations as it identifies a high-risk group with a high likelihood of severe outcomes, and highlights the impact of dialysis location on infection rates.

Title: Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse
Publisher: Human Rights Watch
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Human Rights Watch reported that at least 83 governments worldwide have used the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to violate the freedom of speech and peaceful assembly rights of their citizens. This includes attacking, detaining, prosecuting, and even killing critics of their pandemic responses, breaking up peaceful protests, closing media outlets, and enacting vague laws that criminalize speech under the pretense of protecting public health. The victims of these violations include journalists, activists, healthcare workers, and political opposition groups. Human Rights Watch identified specific trends and provided examples from various countries: Military or police forces in at least 18 countries physically assaulted journalists, bloggers, and protesters, sometimes resulting in deaths. Authorities in at least 10 countries arbitrarily banned or broke up protests, citing social distancing concerns or using COVID-19 as an excuse to disperse gatherings critical of the government. At least 24 countries have enacted vague laws criminalizing the spread of alleged misinformation about COVID-19, which can easily be used as a tool for repression. Authorities in at least 51 countries have used COVID-19 laws and regulations, as well as counterterrorism measures, to arbitrarily arrest, detain, and prosecute critics of their pandemic responses. At least 33 governments have threatened critics with prosecution if they speak out against the authorities' pandemic response. Human Rights Watch recommends that governments immediately end excessive restrictions on free speech in the name of COVID-19 prevention and hold accountable those responsible for serious human rights violations. They also emphasize the obligation of governments to provide accurate information on health threats and the dangers of disproportionate curbs on free speech in countering COVID-19 misinformation.

Title: COVID-19 pandemic can affect feet
Publisher: Mayo Clinic Health System
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article offers advice on foot care during the COVID-19 pandemic, as changes in routine and closures of businesses may impact foot health. Here are the key points: 1. Transition to barefoot: Many people now work or study from home and have transitioned to spending most of their time barefoot or in stockings. While this may feel comfortable, a lack of arch support can increase the risk of foot conditions like plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, Achilles tendinitis, and tendonitis. Wearing supportive shoes or slippers at home can help prevent these issues. 2. Protection from injury: Shoes also protect feet from injuries like stepping on sharp objects or stubbing toes. Keeping the floor clear of clutter can help prevent painful toe stubs. 3. Exercise at home: With gyms closed or operating at reduced capacity, more people are exercising at home. Wearing supportive athletic shoes is crucial for providing cushion and arch support during workouts. It's also recommended to vary exercise routines and increase intensity gradually to prevent injury. 4. Ingrown toenails: As salons are closed, people prone to ingrown toenails may be at risk. To prevent this, it's recommended to trim toenails straight across, maintain moderate nail length, wear properly fitting shoes, and use protective footwear to prevent injuries. Soaking feet, placing cotton under the toenail, and applying antibiotic cream can help treat ingrown toenails at home. 5. Diabetes foot care: For individuals with diabetes, prompt medical attention is necessary for any foot injuries or symptoms like pain, redness, swelling, or open wounds with drainage. Delaying treatment can lead to serious complications, including hospitalization or amputation. Overall, maintaining proper foot care and wearing supportive footwear, even while at home, is important for preventing foot-related health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: The roots of Canada’s COVID-19 vaccine shortage go back decades
Publisher: The Conversation
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
As of February 5, 2021, Canada had administered 2.7 COVID-19 vaccine doses per 100 people, significantly fewer than countries like Israel (61.7) and the UK (16.2). Canada's slow vaccine rollout can be attributed to a lack of domestic production and delays from foreign manufacturers. Canada's attempt to secure a deal with CanSino Biologics fell through, and the National Research Council (NRC) facility, which was supposed to produce vaccines, faced delays and won't be ready until late 2021. Canada is now reliant on foreign sources, but facing delays from Pfizer and Moderna due to production issues and vaccine nationalism from the US and EU. The Canadian government's response, including a deal for the AstraZeneca vaccine through COVAX, has been criticized as secretive and poorly planned. The lack of domestic production and international cooperation has contributed to the uncertainties in Canada's COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Title: New COVID-19 outbreak declared at Cargill meat plant in Alberta — site of Canada's largest outbreak
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
There is a new outbreak of COVID-19 cases at the Cargill meat-processing plant in High River, Alberta, with 11 cases linked to the facility as of Saturday. This is concerning as the site was the largest COVID-19 outbreak in Canada last spring, with nearly half of its workforce (at least 950 staff) testing positive. The union representing the workers is trying to determine the extent of the outbreak and whether health and safety measures are adequate. The company is also facing a proposed class-action lawsuit related to the previous outbreak. With the current outbreak, there are concerns that a repeat of the deadly 2020 outbreak could occur, and the Alberta NDP leader has stated that the plant must be shut down if new safety measures don't work. This outbreak is one of seven currently occurring at meat-processing facilities in the province.
