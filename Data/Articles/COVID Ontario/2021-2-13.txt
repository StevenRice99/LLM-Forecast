Title: 'Our job to step in': Hospitals take on COVID-19 patients from other overwhelmed regions
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the province's COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS), which transfers patients from overwhelmed hospitals to those with available space. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: 545 non-ICU COVID-19 patients were transferred between hospitals from Nov. 16 to Feb. 9. 320 non-COVID-19 patients were transferred to build capacity for COVID-19 patients. 70 patients were transferred from one intensive care unit to another since the new year. Halton Healthcare, which operates Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital, has taken in 190 COVID-19 patients from other regions, the most of any Ontario health network. The region of Peel, with a population of 1.5 million, has logged nearly 59,000 cases since the start of the pandemic. The IMS system has helped prevent hospitals from becoming completely overwhelmed, with some hospitals taking in patients from other jurisdictions to "load level" and prevent capacity from being exceeded. The article also mentions that 25% of COVID-19 patients can quickly worsen, requiring hospitals to keep a certain number of ICU beds unoccupied as a contingency measure. These values provide insight into the province's hospital capacity, patient transfer systems, and regional case numbers, which can inform forecasting models for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.
