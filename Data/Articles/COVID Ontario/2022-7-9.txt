Posted: 1 day ago
COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes and retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, are causing concern among residents, families, and experts. Jodie McConnell, whose mother Jean lives in a long-term care home, panicked when she heard about another outbreak, fearing it would be like previous ones. As of last weekend, 65 long-term care homes and 51 retirement homes in Ontario were reporting outbreaks. The province's top doctor confirmed the seventh wave of COVID-19, with the sharpest increase in case rates among those aged 80 and above. Experts are calling for a greater push for fourth vaccine doses and a reinstatement of vaccine mandates for long-term care staff to prevent outbreaks and protect vulnerable residents. Dr. Samir Sinha emphasizes the importance of fourth doses for seniors and better access to vaccines for residents, staff, and their families. The removal of the vaccine mandate for long-term care workers has created a precarious situation, according to Professor Vivian Stamatopoulos, a long-term care advocate. Staffing shortages due to COVID-19 infections in the seventh wave are devastating, according to Ian Da Silva of the Ontario Personal Support Workers Association, as remaining staff are stretched thin, impacting the level of care residents receive. Families are considering hiring private support workers, but it comes at a significant cost. The Minister of Long-Term Care in Ontario was unavailable for comment on the outbreaks.

Ontario's top doctor, Dr. Kieran Moore, has confirmed that the province has entered its seventh wave of COVID-19, driven primarily by the Omicron BA.5 subvariant. This subvariant has become the dominant strain and is responsible for approximately 60% of confirmed cases. Dr. Moore predicts that this wave will last for another four to five weeks, with infections expected to increase over the next 10 days before slowing down. The province is currently reviewing eligibility for fourth vaccine doses. Key indicators of this new wave include test positivity rates rising above 10% for the first time since May and an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations. As of June 29, there were 605 hospitalizations, an increase of 89 from the previous week. The Ontario COVID-19 science advisory table has advised the public to wear high-quality masks in crowded indoor settings and to improve ventilation. They also recommend that anyone over 18 who hasn't received a third vaccine dose should get it now. While BA.5 is not believed to be more severe than previous strains, the advisory table warns that any surge in cases will put additional strain on an already overburdened healthcare system. They also note the possibility of an increase in deaths among higher-risk groups if the subvariant spreads widely. The rise in cases in Ontario mirrors trends seen in several other G10 countries, including France, the U.K., and Italy.

Title: Contact tracing and quarantine in the context of COVID-19: interim guidance, 6 July 2022
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 3 days ago
The article provides an overview of the World Health Organization's (WHO) updated guidelines on contact tracing and quarantine for COVID-19. Here is a summary: WHO recommends prioritizing identification, contact tracing, quarantine, and follow-up for individuals at high risk who have been in close contact with someone infected with SARS-CoV-2. This shift from targeting all contacts to a more targeted approach considers the growing global population immunity from vaccination and previous infections. The guidance shortens the recommended quarantine period and allows for further reduction through testing. This flexibility aims to balance the benefits of quarantine with the potential societal and economic impacts of longer isolation periods. National and local health authorities are advised to adopt a risk-based approach that takes into account local conditions, disease epidemiology, population immunity levels, healthcare system capacities, and risk tolerance. This tailored response ensures that contact tracing and quarantine strategies remain effective and feasible. Fact to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Prioritizing contact tracing and quarantine for high-risk individuals can help identify those at higher risk of severe disease or hospitalization. This targeted approach allows for more efficient use of healthcare resources and can help reduce the overall burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, monitoring local trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and the prevalence of new variants can provide valuable data for forecasting hospitalizations. Understanding the relationship between case numbers and hospitalization rates, as well as the impact of vaccination and previous infections on reducing severe disease, can help inform more accurate forecasts.

The article discusses the concept of reverse zoonosis, where diseases like COVID-19 can be transmitted from humans to animals. It highlights the impact of COVID-19 on various animal species, including pets, farmed animals, zoo animals, and wildlife. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) emphasizes the importance of monitoring and reporting cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals to better understand the spread of the virus and its potential impact on both animal and human health. The article mentions instances of COVID-19 transmission to animals such as dogs, hamsters, and white-tailed deer, raising concerns about the possibility of virus evolution in animals and future reintroduction into human populations. It stresses the need for effective biosecurity measures when interacting with animals, proper handwashing practices, and avoiding contact with wildlife to prevent reverse zoonosis. The article underscores the importance of reporting animal cases of COVID-19 to national authorities and organizations like the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) to enhance global surveillance efforts and prevent future outbreaks. By monitoring the virus's spread in animals, we can better protect both animal and human health, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more sustainable future for all.

Title: Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country
Publisher: BBC.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
As of the article's publication, Covid-19 has infected over 550 million people and caused over six million deaths globally. The US, India, and Brazil have the highest number of confirmed cases, but very few places have been left untouched. The true extent of the initial outbreak in 2020 is unclear due to limited testing at the time. While deaths are falling in many areas, official figures may not fully reflect the true number in some countries. Researchers suggest that excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying compared to previous years, indicate that the true death toll may be much higher. Worldwide vaccine rollouts have been successful, with over 64% of people fully vaccinated on every continent except Africa, which has a vaccination rate of about 20%. However, some countries have secured more vaccine doses than they need, while lower-income countries rely on initiatives like Covax for access. Daily global cases are rising again due to the highly contagious BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant. Asia, the initial center of the outbreak, now shows a mixed picture, with North Korea and China experiencing outbreaks while Japan has reopened its borders. Europe is also seeing rising cases due to these subvariants, and the UK is experiencing a jump in infections and hospitalizations. In North America, while the US has the highest case and death counts globally, daily cases and deaths have decreased. Latin America has some pockets of rising cases, with Mexico and Guatemala seeing increases. Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, with over 32 million cases and the second-highest death toll worldwide. Africa likely has an undercounted number of cases and deaths due to low testing rates, with South Africa being the worst-hit country on the continent. The Middle East has had severe outbreaks, with Iran and Iraq having high death and case counts, while Israel's successful vaccination campaign has minimized hospitalizations and deaths. Australia and New Zealand, initially praised for their Covid responses, saw increases in cases in early 2022 but have since reopened their borders. Forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations can be complex and depend on various factors, including vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, and the implementation of public health measures. The article mentions that the Omicron variant and its subvariants are more contagious but milder than previous strains, which may impact hospitalization rates. Additionally, the availability of vaccines and boosters can help reduce severe cases and hospitalizations.

Title: Small NIH study reveals how immune response triggered by COVID-19 may damage the brain
Publisher: National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted a study that reveals how the immune response triggered by COVID-19 can cause damage to the brain, providing insight into the shortand long-term neurological symptoms associated with the virus. The study found evidence of an attack on the cells lining the brain's blood vessels by antibodies produced by the immune system, leading to inflammation and damage. This damage can result in bleeds, clots, and an increased risk of stroke in COVID-19 patients. The findings suggest that an antibody-mediated attack activates endothelial cells, causing platelets to stick to blood vessel walls and leading to clots and leakage. This process can also disrupt the tight junctions between endothelial cells, causing further leakage and allowing immune cells to enter the brain and trigger inflammation. More than 300 genes showed decreased expression, while six genes associated with oxidative stress, DNA damage, and metabolic dysregulation were increased, offering potential therapeutic targets. While the exact antigen triggering the immune response remains unclear as the virus was not detected in the brain, the study has important implications for understanding and treating long-term neurological symptoms of Long COVID, including headache, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, sleep problems, and "brain fog." The results suggest that immune-modulating therapies may be beneficial for these patients, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Here is a summary of the article: Title: Study finds South Asian Canadians in GTA disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in pandemic's first year A recent study funded by the Canadian federal government has revealed that South Asian Canadian communities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 during the initial year of the pandemic. The analysis identified Peel Region as Ontario's COVID hotspot before the vaccine rollout in April 2021. During the second wave, Peel Region accounted for about 23.6% of Ontario's cases, despite having only 10% of the province's population. The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) Open, investigated sociodemographic factors contributing to higher infection rates among certain ethnicities. It found that lower socioeconomic status was the primary factor associated with higher seropositivity rates in Peel Region's South Asian community. Other factors included a large proportion of essential workers, extended family living situations, and difficulties accessing testing and time off work. Dr. Sonia Anand, the principal investigator from McMaster University, emphasized that the study highlights social disparities and inequities in healthcare access across Ontario. The findings are expected to inform future pandemic responses and efforts to achieve more equitable health outcomes nationwide. Additionally, the study results will be utilized to prioritize healthcare resources for at-risk communities in forecasted future COVID-19 waves.

Canada is set to discard millions of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses as they passed their expiration date without finding domestic or international takers. Canada had promised to donate these doses but faced challenges due to limited demand and recipient country challenges. This incident highlights vaccine hesitancy and the complexities of vaccine distribution and absorption in lower-income nations. Canada has a high vaccination rate, with 85% fully vaccinated, compared to 61% globally and 16% in the poorest countries. Canada also has unused doses of Novavax and Medicago vaccines, with no clear plan for utilization or donation. The federal government faces calls for transparency regarding vaccine contracts and strategies to prevent vaccine wastage.

Title: Covid-19 reinfections may increase the likelihood of new health problems
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The study reveals that people with Covid-19 reinfections have more than double the risk of dying and triple the risk of hospitalization within six months of their last infection, compared to those with only one infection. The risk of new health problems, including lung and heart issues, fatigue, and kidney disorders, also increases with each subsequent infection. This is concerning as the Omicron BA.5 variant is causing a fresh wave of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe, and it can evade antibodies from vaccines or prior infections. The study's author, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, emphasizes that each Covid-19 infection adds new risk, and this cumulative effect can lead to serious health issues. Experts agree that the idea of reinfections being mild is not always true, and the risk of serious illness or death persists with each infection. To mitigate the risk, experts recommend wearing N95 masks in public places, especially for those at higher risk or wanting to avoid illness.
