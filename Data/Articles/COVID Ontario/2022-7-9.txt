Wastewater data has been ticking upward throughout June, indicating a potential summer wave of COVID-19.
The seven-day average for new PCR-positive cases was up 34% week-over-week, with 585 people currently hospitalized with the virus (up from 486 a week earlier).
The BA.5 sublineage of Omicron is thought to be the dominant variant and may contribute to higher hospitalization rates.
Experts expect this wave to be less intense than previous ones, but still warn of potential issues in the fall due to increased indoor activities.
