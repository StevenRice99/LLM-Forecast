A brief summary of the article relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ontario has entered its seventh wave of COVID-19 driven by the Omicron BA.5 subvariant. Approximately 60% of confirmed cases are due to the BA.5 subvariant. The province can expect another four to five weeks in this wave, with infections expected to increase over the next 10 days before slowing down. Test positivity is above 10% for the first time since May, with around 80% of public health units experiencing exponential growth in cases. Ontario is seeing its first increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations since May, with the number of people admitted higher than at any time last summer. The advisory table recommends getting third doses of COVID-19 vaccines now, especially for those over 60 or immunocompromised, and advises wearing high-quality masks in crowded indoor settings. The group notes that while BA.5 may not be more severe than previous strains, any surge could impact hospitals already dealing with staff shortages and record wait times.

A brief summary of the article relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The article discusses Ontario's entry into a summer wave of COVID-19, with hospitalizations and wastewater data showing an upward trend. Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations include: Increase in COVID-19 wastewater data throughout June. Rise in the number of people testing positive for COVID-19, with a 34% increase in new cases detected through PCR testing week-over-week. Hospitalizations are increasing, with 585 people in Ontario hospitals testing positive for the virus, up from 486 a week earlier. The increase in hospitalizations is largely driven by the BA.5 sublineage of Omicron, which has the ability to evade some protective immunity from vaccination or prior infection. The article also mentions the anticipation of higher transmission in the fall due to increased indoor activities and the presence of other respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV. This information can be valuable for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
