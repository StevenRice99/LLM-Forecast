The article reports on various studies and updates related to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world.
Remdesivir Study 
A World Health Organization (WHO) study found that Remdesivir, a drug being used to treat COVID-19, showed little effect on mortality or length of hospital stays among patients with the disease.

Title: Blood type O may mean lower risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness, new studies suggest
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Relevant.
The article suggests that blood type may play a role in a person's susceptibility to COVID-19 and their chance of having a severe bout of the disease. The studies found:
In one study, 38.4% with blood type O tested positive for COVID-19, compared to unknown proportions for other blood types.
In another study, patients with blood type A or AB required mechanical ventilation more frequently (84%) and had longer ICU stays (median of 13.5 days) than those with blood group O or B (61% and median of 9 days).
These findings may be useful in understanding individual risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, but the article also emphasizes that other factors like age and comorbidities are more important determinants of severity.
