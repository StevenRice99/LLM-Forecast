Title: Long-term care homes suffered due to efforts to help hospitals, inquiry hears

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Long-term care homes were unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic, with insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of universal masking policies, and physicians refusing to enter facilities due to fear of the virus. COVID-19 spread rapidly through long-term care homes in the first wave, resulting in over 1,950 resident deaths. Provincial data shows outbreaks are increasing in long-term care homes again as the second wave takes hold. The decision to keep residents in long-term care homes instead of transferring them to hospitals proved deadly. Long-term care homes were looking for the wrong symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, instead of atypical symptoms like delirium, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell. Staffing levels in long-term care homes were problematic before the pandemic and were exacerbated by the pandemic. Transferring patients to hospitals, which had available capacity, was successful in controlling outbreaks in some long-term care homes. These points highlight the importance of considering the vulnerability of long-term care homes to COVID-19 outbreaks and the need for better preparedness, coordination, and communication between long-term care homes and hospitals to prevent and manage outbreaks. This information can inform forecasting models to better predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The province is experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and entering flu season, which could lead to increased hospitalizations.

Last year, hospitals across the province treated 5,719 flu patients, indicating a potential burden on the healthcare system. Current COVID-19 hospitalization numbers: 213 patients in hospitals, 48 in intensive care, and 29 on ventilators. The article highlights the importance of getting the flu shot to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed with both influenza and COVID-19 patients. These values can be used to inform forecasting models about the potential impact of the flu season on COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
