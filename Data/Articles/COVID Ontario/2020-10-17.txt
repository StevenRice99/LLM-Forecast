Here is a summary of the article, including some important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Background: The article discusses the recommendations for the duration of the post-vaccination observation period for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada on immunization practices. Recommendations: NACI recommends maintaining the current post-vaccination observation period of 15 minutes for influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This recommendation is based on fair evidence and applies to individuals with no history of severe allergic reactions or immediate post-vaccination reactions. However, during times when physical distancing cannot be maintained in waiting areas, NACI recommends considering a shorter observation period of 5 to 15 minutes, provided specific conditions are met. These conditions include the past receipt of influenza vaccine without allergic reactions, no history of immediate post-vaccination reactions, and the presence of a responsible adult to monitor the vaccine recipient for at least 15 minutes. Evidence: The evidence for the recommendations is based on a rapid literature review and data from the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS). The review found that serious adverse events requiring medical intervention after immunization are rare. CAEFISS data from 2014-2018 showed a low incidence of anaphylaxis, syncope, and afebrile seizures following influenza vaccination. Rationale: Reducing the post-vaccination observation period can help reduce crowding in vaccination clinics, lowering the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, any reduction in observation time must balance the potential risk of delayed identification of adverse events requiring medical intervention. Conclusion: Maintaining the recommended public health measures, including physical distancing, is crucial in vaccination clinics. A shorter observation period can be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic when physical distancing cannot be maintained, but specific conditions must be met to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients. These recommendations aim to balance the risks of COVID-19 transmission and potential adverse events following influenza vaccination. This article provides insights into the considerations and precautions regarding influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. While forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations involves a multitude of factors, these recommendations could contribute to overall public health strategies and help reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Title: Eight Persistent COVID-19 Myths and Why People Believe Them
Publisher: Scientific American
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Claim 1: COVID-19 was engineered in a Chinese laboratory This claim is false. US intelligence agencies and Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli have denied this possibility. Zhengli's research showed that the COVID-19 sequence did not match any sampled bat coronaviruses. People believe this claim because they want to blame China for the pandemic's impact, and accidental lab releases have occurred in the past. Claim 2: COVID-19 is no more severe than the flu False. Epidemiologists estimate COVID-19's infection fatality rate is 0.5-1%, compared to 0.1% for the flu. By mid-September 2020, COVID-19 had caused 200,000 deaths in the US, far exceeding annual flu-related deaths. People believe this due to misinformation from leaders like Trump, who downplayed COVID-19's severity. Claim 3: Masks are not necessary False. Masks are effective in preventing infected individuals from spreading COVID-19, especially since asymptomatic transmission is possible. Early inconsistent guidance from health organizations and a shortage of high-quality masks contributed to confusion. Some view masks as a violation of their civil liberties or masculinity. Claim 4: Wealthy elites are profiting from the pandemic There is no evidence supporting this claim. Figures like Fauci and Gates have not benefited from the pandemic and have contributed to pandemic response and philanthropy. Wealthy individuals are often targets of conspiracy theories. Trump's criticism of Fauci may influence his supporters' beliefs. Claim 5: Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment False. Multiple studies show hydroxychloroquine does not protect against or treat COVID-19. The FDA and NIH have warned against its use due to risks and a lack of benefits. Initial reports suggested potential effectiveness, and anchoring bias makes people hold onto this belief despite contradictory evidence. Trump's promotion of the drug also influences his supporters. Claim 6: Surges in cases are due to increased testing False. If this were true, the percentage of positive tests would decrease, but analyses show the opposite. Hospitalizations and deaths have increased alongside cases, indicating a true surge. People believe this due to early test shortages and the logical assumption that more tests lead to more detected cases. Claim 7: Herd immunity will protect us False. Experts estimate 60-70% of people need to contract COVID-19 for herd immunity, which would lead to millions of deaths. The UK and Sweden, which initially considered this approach, have high death rates. People want a return to normal, and without a vaccine, herd immunity is the only option. However, antibody studies show even heavily affected regions are far from this threshold. Claim 8: A COVID-19 vaccine will be unsafe Vaccines save millions of lives, and approved vaccines undergo rigorous clinical testing to ensure safety and efficacy. Top vaccine candidates have not shown major adverse effects in trials, and pharmaceutical companies have pledged to prioritize safety. The politicization of the FDA under Trump and the spread of conspiracy theories contribute to vaccine hesitancy. These claims and their rebuttals provide important context for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Understanding misinformation and public perceptions can inform public health strategies and communication to encourage evidence-based practices and reduce the disease's impact.
