The article discusses concerns over hospital capacity in Ontario, particularly at Brampton Civic Hospital, which is experiencing a surge in patient volumes. The hospital's CEO, Dr. Eric Hoskins (not Osler, as mentioned), has stated that a surge in inpatient and emergency department patient volumes would trigger the re-opening of the Urgent Care Centre (UCC).
