This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario: 1. Rising hospitalizations: Hospitalization numbers are increasing in Ontario, with a tripling of hospitalizations in recent weeks. 2.

Healthcare system concerns: The healthcare system may not be prepared for a surge in COVID-19 patients, with concerns about hospital capacity and staffing. 5. Testing and tracing backlogs: Ontario is experiencing testing and tracing backlogs, which may hinder efforts to control the spread of the virus. 6. Virus spread: The virus is spreading into new areas, including remote parts of Canada, which may lead to increased hospitalizations. 7. Global picture: The global situation, including increased cases in other countries, may impact COVID-19 spread in Ontario. 8. Winter season: The upcoming winter season may lead to increased indoor gatherings, potentially facilitating the spread of COVID-19.
