This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the challenges faced by live music venues in Ontario due to the latest COVID-19 guidelines, which only allow 100% capacity at seated events, leaving smaller venues without seats unable to hold shows unless they install chairs, reducing capacity.
