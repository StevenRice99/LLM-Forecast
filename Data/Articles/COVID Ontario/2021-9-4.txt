Title: COVID-19, Mental Health, and Substance Use in Correctional Settings: Considerations for Addressing Systemic Vulnerabilities
Publisher: Mental Health Commission of Canada
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and substance use of correctional populations, who are at an increased risk of contracting and suffering severe outcomes from the virus due to pre-existing health conditions and health inequities. The purpose of the article is to inform decision-makers about these issues and provide guidance on improving mental health and substance use services and supports in correctional settings during and after the pandemic. Here is a summary of the important facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: Incarcerated populations are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to pre-existing health conditions and health inequities. People who are homeless, precariously housed, or living in poverty, as well as those who use drugs (especially injection drugs), are also at heightened risk of infection and death from COVID-19. These issues are exacerbated for Black and Indigenous individuals, both within correctional facilities and in the community. The pandemic's conditions and the loss of freedom of movement have adversely affected the mental health and substance use of incarcerated individuals, particularly those with pre-existing concerns. Inadequate custody facilities and challenges in recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals for correctional settings create complex layers of difficulty in meeting the mental health and substance use needs of incarcerated persons during the pandemic. Decarceration, when coupled with community resources and supports, is an effective measure to control infection and prevent the negative mental health and substance use impacts of COVID-19. These factors should be considered when forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially in relation to correctional populations and their unique mental health and substance use needs.

Title: Heparin Anticoagulation for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
This article provides clinical guidance on the use of heparin anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, offering recommendations based on the severity of the illness. For critically ill patients, the recommendation is to administer prophylactic doses of low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin. Therapeutic dose anticoagulation is not advised unless there is a separate medical indication, as it does not reduce the need for organ support and may increase bleeding risks. For moderately ill patients, therapeutic dose anticoagulation may be considered for those deemed at low risk of bleeding. This treatment may reduce the need for organ support and appears to decrease thrombotic events, but its benefits on survival are unclear, and it may increase major bleeding events. Therefore, a strong recommendation cannot be made. All other patients should receive prophylactic dose anticoagulation. For mildly ill patients, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding anticoagulation. The article also discusses the mechanisms of action of low molecular weight and unfractionated heparin, their side effects, and the clinical trials that informed the recommendations.

Here is a summary of the article on small business expectations and realities during the COVID-19 pandemic: Small businesses in Canada were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and faced many challenges as restrictions eased. The article presents the results of the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, conducted by Statistics Canada from July to August 2021, providing insights into small business expectations and realities. During the survey period, small businesses with 1 to 19 employees were more pessimistic about their sales and profitability compared to larger businesses, with 15.5% expecting a decrease in sales and 28.5% anticipating lower profitability. Small businesses were also more likely to face financial constraints, with 20.5% unable to take on more debt and 18.8% concerned about maintaining sufficient cash flow. Regarding teleworking, smaller businesses were less likely to continue this arrangement post-pandemic, with only 27.2% of businesses with 1 to 19 employees planning to have some employees primarily telework. Additionally, small businesses were less likely to outsource tasks, with only 20.2% outsourcing to freelancers or other businesses. Environmental practices were also less prevalent among small businesses, as only 57.7% reported having at least one environmental practice in place or planned, compared to over 75% for larger businesses. The most common practice was waste reduction. Overall, small businesses in Canada faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and had more pessimistic expectations for sales and profitability. They also faced financial constraints, were less likely to adopt teleworking and environmental practices, and outsourced tasks less frequently. These insights provide a snapshot of small business realities during the pandemic and can inform support strategies for this vital sector of the Canadian economy. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, the following key factors could be considered: Vaccination rates: The number of fully vaccinated individuals in the population can significantly impact the severity of COVID-19 cases and subsequent hospitalizations. Higher vaccination rates generally lead to lower hospitalization rates. Severity of variants: Different variants of COVID-19 can result in varying levels of severity of illness. New variants that evade vaccine protection or are more transmissible can lead to increased hospitalizations. Healthcare capacity: The availability of hospital beds, intensive care units, and healthcare staff can influence the ability to handle a surge in COVID-19 cases. Limited capacity may result in higher hospitalization rates. Public health measures: The implementation and adherence to public health measures, such as mask mandates, social distancing, and gathering restrictions, can impact the spread of the virus and hospitalizations. Demographics: The age and health of the population can affect hospitalization rates. Older populations or those with underlying health conditions are more likely to experience severe illness and require hospitalization. By considering these factors and analyzing data trends, forecasts can be made to anticipate COVID-19 hospitalization needs and inform public health policies and healthcare resource allocation.

Title: Heart inflammation, COVID-19 and the rare side effects of the vaccine
Publisher: UC Davis Health
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: UC Davis Health Cardiologist, Nayereh Pezeshkian, discusses the impact of COVID-19 on heart health and addresses concerns about the rare risk of heart complications from the COVID-19 vaccine. Impact of COVID-19 on the Heart: 20-30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience heart problems, leading to more severe symptoms and worse health outcomes. Heart issues can be due to direct viral damage or the indirect effect of inflammatory proteins (cytokines) released into the bloodstream. Heart muscle inflammation (myocarditis) can lead to heart failure or arrhythmia, potentially causing sudden death. COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of blood clots and vascular inflammation, particularly in the heart and lungs, leading to poor oxygen levels. The right side of the heart may have to work harder due to inflamed lungs and blood clots, resulting in right heart enlargement and potential organ failure. Long-term impacts of COVID-19 on cardiovascular health can include heart failure and rhythm abnormalities due to myocarditis, scar formation, or heart attacks. Elderly individuals and those with heart disease, vascular disease, obesity, or diabetes are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death. COVID-19 Vaccine and Heart Health: Vaccination is crucial, especially for high-risk individuals, as it significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by 90%. Rare cases of mild heart inflammation (myocarditis) have been reported in teenagers post-vaccination, but these cases resolve on their own. The risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 is much higher (2-10%) than the risk associated with the vaccine (about 1 in 6000). Most hospitalizations and deaths occur in unvaccinated individuals. Advice for Patients: Cardiologist Nayereh Pezeshkian advises patients to prioritize heart health by maintaining a healthy diet, staying active, and getting vaccinated to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 complications. This article emphasizes the importance of vaccination, especially for individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes and reduce the strain on the heart.

Title: COVID-19 created lots of supply chain problems — and they're nowhere close to being solved
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global manufacturing and supply chains, and Canadian tech companies have faced numerous challenges as a result. Voltera, a circuit board printer maker, experienced an aluminum shortage, shipping delays due to the suspension of international commercial flights, increased costs, and difficulty acquiring certain parts due to the U.S. government contracting their plastic manufacturer for COVID materials. The company's operations manager, Shawn Baron, compares the situation to "popping holes in a boat." Other companies have also been affected by the microchip shortage, which is expected to continue into 2022, and disruptions in shipping, with costs tripling or even quadrupling. The partial closure of the Ningbo-Zhoushan cargo port in China due to a COVID-19 outbreak is causing further delays. These issues have led to temporary shutdowns in numerous Canadian car plants and toy price increases. The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of long and strict production networks, and companies are encouraged to consider shorter and more regional networks. Dan Breznitz, a professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that Canada should join the U.S. in mapping out supply chains and creating a North American supply chain plan to address these issues and ensure a lifetime opportunity.

Title: Long-Haulers Are Fighting for Their Future
Publisher: The Atlantic
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the impact of long COVID, a condition where people experience persistent symptoms such as extreme fatigue, brain fog, and breathing difficulties months after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of long COVID is still unknown, affecting even young and healthy individuals, and there is limited understanding of its prevalence and duration. The article critiques the slow response and limited recognition of the condition by the biomedical community, which has led to frustration among those suffering from long COVID. The article highlights the need for patient-led research and the inclusion of patient expertise in understanding and treating long COVID. It mentions the work of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, which has produced a comprehensive analysis of long COVID by surveying those affected. Long-haulers, as they are called, want more holistic studies that consider the wide range of symptoms they experience, including neurological and menstrual changes. They also want researchers to acknowledge the similarities between long COVID and other complex illnesses, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The article discusses the challenges faced by long-haulers, including the dismissal of their symptoms by medical professionals and the lack of accurate representation in research and media. It mentions the efforts of some institutions, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to include long-haulers in their research projects and seek their input. However, long-haulers want more involvement in shaping research agendas and influencing policies to ensure their needs are addressed effectively. The article concludes by drawing parallels between the long COVID movement and other advocacy efforts, such as those by autistic individuals, who have pushed for recognition and inclusion in research that affects their lives. It emphasizes the importance of patient-centered research and the need to address the disability and suffering caused by long COVID, even as vaccines reduce hospitalization and death rates.
