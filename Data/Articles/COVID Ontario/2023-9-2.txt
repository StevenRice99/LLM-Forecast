Title: More COVID cases are coming. Here's what you need to know
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 in Canada and the expected challenges this fall. Key points include:
Experts do not believe a new wave is imminent, but there are concerns about the BA.2.86 variant.
Health experts recommend waiting for the new bivalent vaccines to arrive before getting a booster.
The current bivalent vaccine is not effective against the XBB and EG.5 variants, which are dominant this year.
Experts advise people to get their boosters if they're due or at high risk of severe infection, but healthy individuals can wait until the new vaccines come out.
Continued vaccination is still important, as it will reduce the likelihood of a return to a more susceptible population.
Back-to-school concerns 
The article also discusses the expected challenges this fall with the return to school. Key points include:
Health experts expect an increase in viral spread due to the return to school.
Getting children boosted before going back to class will help reduce the spread.
Parents should keep kids home if they're showing any symptoms, and schools should have a plan in place for respiratory illnesses like RSV, influenza, and COVID-19.
Mask mandates and lockdowns 
Experts consulted for the article do not believe there will be mask mandates or lockdowns this fall. Key points include:
A mask mandate would likely be ineffective and cause more harm than good.
Masking and vaccination continue to be the best ways to reduce the spread of the virus.
Experts hope provinces will consider reinstating mask mandates in high-risk environments like hospitals.
Conclusion 
The article concludes that while there are challenges ahead, health experts are not expecting a new wave or widespread measures like lockdowns.
