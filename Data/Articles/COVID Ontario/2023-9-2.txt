Posted: Today
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights several key indicators that suggest Canadians may be on the brink of entering a fall COVID-19 wave, including: 1. An increase in positive test cases over the past month. 2. A rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. 3. Rising virus levels in wastewater across the country. 4. The detection of the highly mutated new variant BA.2.86 in Canada for the first time. The article also notes that the spread of Omicron subvariant EG.5 is driving the current rise in cases, and that this variant accounts for about 60% of current positives. Health experts attribute the recent rise in infections to the spread of EG.5, as well as the fact that many people have not had a booster shot in about 12 months and have lost some degree of immunity. The article also mentions that the new variant BA.2.86 has only been identified in a few countries around the world, but its high number of mutations has health experts concerned. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, the article suggests that: 1. The current rise in cases is expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks. 2. The return to school is expected to bring an increase in viral spread. 3. The new variant BA.2.86 may cause a subsequent pandemic wave if it emerges and has a growth advantage. 4. Masking, staying up to date with vaccinations, and staying home when showing symptoms will all be effective in slowing the spike of the wave. Overall, the article suggests that Ontario, Canada may be entering a fall COVID-19 wave, and that continued vaccination and public health measures will be important in reducing the spread of the virus.

Posted: 1 day ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: A new COVID-19 variant, BA.2.86, has been detected in British Columbia, and Health Canada is monitoring its spread and effectiveness against updated vaccines. COVID-19 cases involving the XBB.1.5 variant are currently at a low to moderate level in all reporting provinces and territories, including Ontario. Two hospitals in Ontario and Prince Edward Island have announced outbreaks of COVID-19. Vaccination rates in Canada are high, with 80.5% of Canadians having received their primary series of COVID vaccines, but booster uptake is low, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Experts recommend that Canadians get a booster shot in the fall, especially if it has been at least six months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection. The upcoming respiratory season may pose a triple threat of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, which could impact healthcare systems. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include: The spread and effectiveness of new COVID-19 variants, such as BA.2.86 Vaccination rates and booster uptake, particularly among vulnerable populations The impact of the upcoming respiratory season on healthcare systems The availability and distribution of updated vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Ottawa's COVID-19 trends are stable or rising, with moderate to high levels of the virus in the community. The average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 is 28, with one patient in an ICU. The city's weekly average test positivity rate is about 15%, which is considered high. There are 22 active COVID outbreaks in Ottawa, with about half of them in hospitals. The health unit reported 177 more COVID cases in the last week and five more COVID deaths, all people age 70 and above. Wastewater data shows a slow rise in coronavirus levels over the past six weeks, breaking out of the range where it had stayed since the end of April. These values suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa, and potentially in other parts of Ontario, may be increasing in the near future. The rising wastewater levels, high test positivity rate, and increasing number of outbreaks all indicate a growing presence of the virus in the community, which could lead to more hospitalizations.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting the most important values: A new COVID-19 variant, BA.2.86, has been detected in British Columbia, which may lead to an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The variant has several mutations from the original Omicron strain, which warrants close monitoring. Symptoms of the new variant are similar to previous variants, including loss of taste and smell, fever, chills, and body aches. The start of the new school year may lead to increased spread, particularly among children. Older Canadians or those with underlying medical conditions are advised to stay up-to-date with COVID-19 boosters, although the level of protection against BA.2.86 is currently unknown. These points suggest that the new variant could lead to an increase in hospitalizations, particularly in vulnerable populations such as older Canadians or those with underlying medical conditions. The spread of the variant among children as they return to school could also contribute to an increase in hospitalizations.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The COVID-19 caseload is expected to grow in the weeks ahead, with an uptick in positive test results reported by Public Health Ontario (PHO). The percentage of positive test results has increased from 5.2% in early July to 9.9% between August 13-19. Ontario wastewater signals suggest that COVID-19 infections are steadily increasing in number. The number of COVID-related hospitalizations in Ontario has been stable for months, despite an increase in test positivity. New vaccines specifically designed to target an Omicron subvariant of the virus are being reviewed by Health Canada and are expected to be available in the fall. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is recommending that all people previously vaccinated against COVID-19 prepare to get a dose of the new formulation once it's available. These points suggest that there may be an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Ontario in the coming weeks and months, but the availability of new vaccines and vaccination efforts may help mitigate this increase.

Title: Opinion: COVID-19 unleashed a crisis of delirium in our hospitals
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The article highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on older adults in Canada, who account for 69.5% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations and 91.7% of all COVID-19 deaths. The authors discuss the failure of effective delirium care during the pandemic, which has led to increased sedative use and negative outcomes for older adults. The study found that older adults admitted to Ontario hospitals during the pandemic experienced more delirium and were discharged with more sedating medications compared to before the pandemic. The authors emphasize the need to reverse these trends, particularly with the anticipated seasonal wave of viral illnesses in the fall and winter. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: The proportion of older adults in the population (20%) and their disproportionate representation in COVID-19 hospitalizations (69.5%) and deaths (91.7%). The increased risk of delirium and sedative use among older adults during the pandemic. The potential for seasonal waves of viral illnesses, such as influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, to impact hospitalizations and delirium care. These values can inform forecasting models by highlighting the importance of considering the age distribution of the population and the potential for increased hospitalizations and delirium among older adults during the pandemic.

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Doctors are bracing for a potential "tripledemic" of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19, which could lead to increased hospitalizations and emergency room visits. The Southern Hemisphere, particularly Australia, has seen a busy season with these three viruses, which could indicate a similar trend in Canada. Children aged 16 and younger bore the brunt of hospital admissions in Australia, constituting 72% of hospital admissions. The severity of this flu season remains uncertain, but a clearer picture may emerge by the end of September, in terms of COVID-19 cases. Historically, rates of these viruses increase in the fall as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors. Influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 are all primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, which can spread more easily when people gather indoors during colder months. Last flu season, children's hospitals across Canada reported significant surges in patients, which led to canceled surgeries and redeployment of staff to help in overcrowded emergency departments and intensive care units. Doctors and hospitals are preparing for the upcoming season by increasing staffing and bed capacity, redirecting patients with less severe symptoms to alternative healthcare facilities, and ensuring a stable supply of vaccines and personal protective equipment. Vaccines, including the flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster shots, will be available in the fall, and parents are encouraged to get their children vaccinated to prevent serious illness. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of hospital admissions due to influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 Age distribution of hospital admissions (e.g., children aged 16 and younger) Severity of flu season Timing of peak season (e.g., end of September) Historical trends of virus transmission and hospitalizations Vaccination rates and availability of vaccines Hospital capacity and preparedness measures (e.g., staffing, bed capacity, alternative healthcare facilities)

TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: A new COVID-19 variant of concern, EG.5, has been identified, with reported cases increasing globally and in Canada, particularly in the US, where it accounts for over 17% of cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published an Initial Risk Evaluation of EG.5, stating that while there is no evidence of increased disease severity, there is a risk of global transmission that could contribute to a surge in cases. In Ontario, 10 out of 27 regions under wastewater surveillance have seen an increase in COVID-19 levels. Peel Public Health is aware of the new variant and is monitoring and responding to all respiratory illness activity, including COVID-19. The return to school in early September could create conditions for an early fall wave of COVID cases. Public Health Ontario recommends enhancing outdoor air ventilation and/or filtration in indoor settings to reduce exposure to COVID-19. Ontario School Safety, a volunteer-led organization, is advocating for clean indoor air conditions in Ontario schools, citing concerns about air quality and the potential impact on respiratory health. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Increasing cases of EG.5 variant WHO's risk evaluation of EG.5 Wastewater surveillance data showing increased COVID-19 levels in 10 out of 27 regions in Ontario Return to school in early September potentially leading to an early fall wave of COVID cases Importance of enhancing outdoor air ventilation and/or filtration in indoor settings to reduce exposure to COVID-19.
