Title: What you need to know about COVID rapid tests heading into the fall
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in Quebec, Canada, and experts are advising residents to be prepared and know how to access testing if needed. Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist, warns that the combination of increasing cases, waning immunity, and changing social behavior as people head indoors for the fall could lead to a significant spike in infections. The average level of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Montreal's wastewater has been rising since mid-August, and nearly 2,000 new cases were recorded in the province last week. To curb the spread, Dr. Vinh recommends wearing masks in crowded areas, ensuring proper ventilation, and getting tested when symptomatic. While rapid tests are available for free at vaccination and screening centers, their availability at pharmacies is currently limited to specific at-risk groups. The general public can purchase tests at certain pharmacies, but demand has been low, according to the president of the Association québécoise des pharmaciens propriétaires. Dr. Vinh emphasizes the importance of testing for tracking the virus's spread and hopes for wider distribution of rapid tests in anticipation of high community transmission. Quebec currently has a surplus of about 65 million rapid tests, and some of these will be shared with developing countries. Free testing kits are also available in schools and daycares, with the possibility of additional supplies based on demand. Private companies and community organizations can obtain rapid tests for their staff through the Health Ministry. An updated vaccine booster will be available in October, according to the Quebec Health Ministry. With these measures in place, Quebec aims to manage the anticipated rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations effectively.

Title: Omicron and its Subvariants: A Guide to What We Know
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Here is a summary of the article, incorporating important facts to aid in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: As of September 2023, the battle against COVID-19 continues with the Omicron variant and its subvariants driving most cases in the United States. The article highlights two recent Omicron strains: EG.5 ("Eris") and BA.2.86 ("Pirola"). Eris arrived in the US over the summer and quickly became the dominant strain, possibly contributing to a summer surge in cases and hospitalizations. Scientists are still studying its transmissibility and severity. Pirola, on the other hand, has a relatively low number of reported cases but has been detected in multiple countries, including the US. It exhibits over 30 mutations in its spike protein, which may indicate increased transmissibility and severity, but this is yet to be confirmed. To stay updated, the article recommends following organizations like Yale Medicine and referring to the CDC's weekly updates on tracking COVID-19 variants. The dynamic nature of the virus and its rapid evolution emphasize the importance of staying informed through official channels to help forecast hospitalizations and make informed decisions regarding COVID-19.

Title: Omicron, Delta, Alpha, and More: What To Know About the Coronavirus Variants > News > Yale Medicine
Publisher: Yale Medicine
Trusted: True
Posted: 1 day ago
Omicron and its subvariants have been the dominant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the US for almost two years, with the original Omicron strain (BA.1) being replaced by new subvariants. Omicron was first detected in late 2021 and caused a surge in cases in the US, and new strains are being monitored in 2023, such as EG.5 ("Eris") and BA.2.86 ("Pirola"). Omicron subvariants are highly contagious, with mutations in the spike protein increasing the probability of infection. While the original Omicron strain was generally less severe than previous variants, surges in cases can still lead to increased hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinations remain the best protection against Omicron, and the CDC expects the updated 2023 COVID-19 booster to reduce severe disease and hospitalization from the recent subvariants. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to monitor the spread of Omicron subvariants, vaccination rates, and the effectiveness of the updated booster.

Title: COVID-19: B.C. gears up for vaccine campaign as fall wave, new variant loom
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
British Columbia is encouraging its residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as part of its fall vaccination campaign, especially with the recent detection of the new BA.2.86 variant in the province. While there has only been one case of this variant so far, health officials are concerned about a potential fall uptick in cases driven by other dominant subvariants. There are also questions about the province's readiness as immunity from the last booster shot may be waning. Federal health data shows that while most British Columbians are double vaccinated, far fewer have received a shot this year. Similarly, data from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control indicates slow immunization progress, with only one-third of residents having received a full series of four doses. With the return to school, there are concerns about low vaccination rates among children aged five to 11. Health officials recommend precautions such as masking and good hygiene, and they emphasize the importance of staying home when feeling unwell. A booster shot, likely to be approved by the federal government in September, is expected to provide protection against Omicron strains and severe disease. The National Advisory Council on Immunization has advised a fall booster, especially for those at high risk.

Health officials in British Columbia, Canada, have detected the first known case of the BA.2.86 COVID-19 variant in the country. While the variant has not been found through wastewater surveillance, indicating that it is not widespread, its emergence has put health officials on alert. The Provincial Health Officer and Health Minister have stated that the variant does not seem to cause more severe illness, and the infected individual is not hospitalized. However, as fall approaches and people spend more time indoors, health officials predict an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. A new vaccine is expected to be the best protection against new variants, and health officials advise people to stay home when sick, wear masks, wash hands frequently, and stay up-to-date with vaccinations. With the detection of the new variant and the upcoming respiratory season, health officials and physicians emphasize the importance of taking precautions to protect against COVID-19.

As of May 2, 2023, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide exceeded 725 million, with the United States, India, and France being the top three countries with the highest number of cases. The number of COVID-19 cases is an important indicator for forecasting hospitalizations. However, it's important to consider other factors as well, such as the severity of infections, the availability of effective treatments, and the capacity and preparedness of healthcare systems. Here are some additional key facts from the article that can help in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: The United States had the highest number of COVID-19 cases, with over 82 million, followed by India with nearly 44 million and France with over 35 million. These countries have experienced multiple waves of infections, indicating a higher risk of hospitalizations. The top 20 countries with the highest number of cases accounted for more than 500 million cases, representing a significant proportion of the global caseload. Healthcare systems in these countries may face challenges in managing COVID-19 hospitalizations. The data suggests a general downward trend in daily new cases globally since early 2022. However, this trend doesn't necessarily reflect the true picture, as testing rates and reporting practices may vary across countries and over time. The article provides a snapshot of COVID-19 cases as of May 2, 2023, and doesn't capture subsequent developments. The situation can change rapidly due to factors such as new variants, changes in public health measures, and vaccine coverage. In summary, the article presents a global overview of COVID-19 cases by country as of May 2, 2023. While the number of cases is a crucial factor in forecasting hospitalizations, it should be considered alongside other variables that influence the severity and impact of the disease.

The COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) has acquired three new licensing agreements through the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a multi-stakeholder partnership that facilitates the sharing of intellectual property, knowledge, and innovations for COVID-19. These agreements include licenses for a COVID-19 vaccine, a vaccine prototype, and a technology for quantification of neutralizing antibodies. This boost to the C-TAP initiative is important for facilitating sustainable access to affordable and effective medicines and health technologies, as well as raising awareness about the role of technology and knowledge sharing in the fight against COVID-19. The licensing agreements are global, transparent, and non-exclusive, providing an opportunity for manufacturers worldwide to access the technologies. The first license on a serological test has already resulted in a successful sublicense, demonstrating the potential impact of the initiative. C-TAP was launched by the WHO and the Government of Costa Rica in 2020 and has since been supported by 44 Member States. The organization is committed to making COVID-19 tools accessible to everyone and has received gratitude from the WHO Director-General. The addition of these three new licenses is a significant step forward in the fight against COVID-19 and could potentially help to forecast hospitalizations by increasing access to vaccines and treatments.

Title: Canadian doctors brace for another ‘tripledemic’ – COVID-19, RSV and influenza - National
Publisher: Global News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Doctors in Canada are anticipating a potential "tripledemic" or "tridemic" of influenza, respiratory syncytual virus (RSV), and COVID-19 during the upcoming respiratory flu season, which typically runs from November to March. The previous flu season saw a surge in all three respiratory viruses, especially among children, leading to increased hospitalizations. This trend was also observed in Australia's recent flu season, where children aged 16 and under made up 72% of hospital admissions. To prepare for the potential surge, Canadian doctors and hospitals are developing plans such as increasing staffing and bed capacity and redirecting less severe patients to alternative healthcare facilities. The public is advised to prioritize hygiene practices, stay home when sick, and ensure their vaccinations are up to date. Updated COVID-19 booster shots are expected to be available in the fall, and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends a booster dose for all Canadians aged five and up if it has been at least six months since their last vaccine dose or infection.

A group of health professionals in British Columbia, Protect Our Province B.C., is advocating for the reinstatement of mask mandates in schools and hospitals to prevent another "tripledemic" of COVID-19, RSV, and influenza infections. The group is concerned that rising COVID-19 cases and the emergence of new subvariants could overwhelm hospitals again this fall. Data from the Canadian Centre for Health Information shows that while COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased compared to the previous year, fewer people are ending up in the ICU. Wastewater data also indicates that viral concentrations are rising in some regions of the province. Experts agree that protective measures, such as mask mandates and improving ventilation in schools, can help reduce the spread of the virus. They also emphasize the importance of staying home when sick and getting vaccinated, including the updated COVID-19 vaccines expected to be available in the fall. While the impact of the new subvariants is unclear, taking precautions and following public health measures can help prevent another surge in hospitalizations.
