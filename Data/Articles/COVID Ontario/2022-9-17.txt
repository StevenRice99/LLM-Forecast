Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The article is somewhat relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Key points:
COVID-19 hospitalization rates are increasing among children in Alberta, particularly those under 12 years old.
Low vaccination rates among children (51.1% of kids aged 5-11 have received their first dose) contribute to the high hospitalization rate.
Pediatric doses of the COVID-19 vaccine can prevent severe disease and hospitalization in children.
The article highlights a potential concern that low vaccination rates may lead to increased long-term health issues, such as disabilities or long COVID, among children.
However, some points are specific to Alberta (e.g., low vaccination rates) and not directly applicable to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario.
