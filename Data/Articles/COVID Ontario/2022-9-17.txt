The article discusses the association between COVID-19 and blood clots, a well-recognized complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood clots can occur in the veins or arteries, leading to serious conditions such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), heart attack, or stroke. While blood clotting is also an extremely rare side effect of certain COVID-19 vaccines, the risk is significantly lower compared to the risk associated with COVID-19 infection. The link between COVID-19 and blood clots was observed early in the pandemic, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe illness. However, people with non-severe COVID-19 have also developed blood clots. Data from the pandemic's onset indicated that the incidence of blood clots in COVID-19 patients ranged from 5 to 40 percent, influenced by individual risk factors and illness severity. Those at higher risk of developing blood clots due to COVID-19 include individuals with a history of blood clots or hereditary clotting disorders, severe COVID-19 requiring ICU hospitalization, respiratory failure, prolonged immobility, and underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cancer. Blood clots typically occur during the first week or month following COVID-19 infection. The incidence of blood clots related to COVID-19 appears to be decreasing, which experts attribute to improved testing, early detection, enhanced treatment options, and better access to therapeutic approaches. New guidelines recommend anticoagulation therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate illness to reduce the risk of blood clots. While the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines have not been linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have been rarely associated with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). However, the occurrence of VITT is exceedingly rare, and the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks, especially for individuals with a history of blood clots or increased risk factors.

Title: How long after I get COVID-19 will I test negative?
Publisher: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: While isolation guidelines for individuals infected with COVID-19 have shifted from mandatory to voluntary in many places, and the recommended isolation period has been reduced to five days, it's important to understand that these changes may be influenced by politics and societal factors rather than solely based on scientific evidence. The article emphasizes that a positive COVID-19 test result does not always indicate contagiousness. The time it takes to test negative can vary depending on the severity of the case and the type of test used. PCR tests are highly sensitive and may detect viral fragments even after an individual is no longer infectious. On the other hand, antigen tests are less sensitive and may be less likely to give a positive result days after the initial infection. While some people may test positive on PCR tests for weeks or months, it is unlikely that they remain contagious for an extended period from a single infection. However, testing positive on an antigen test suggests the presence of viral proteins and the potential for infectiousness. According to infectious-disease specialist Amy Barczak, there is currently no data to support a five-day isolation period, and a quarter of people infected with the Omicron variant may still be infectious after eight days. As of May 10, 2022, the World Health Organization recommends a ten-day isolation period from the onset of symptoms or diagnosis, plus an additional three days without symptoms. In conclusion, while the science behind isolation guidelines is evolving, the consensus is that it is uncommon for individuals to remain infectious after ten days, as they typically stop shedding culturable virus by that time. This information can help inform forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations by providing insights into the infectious period and the potential impact of isolation guidelines on transmission rates.
