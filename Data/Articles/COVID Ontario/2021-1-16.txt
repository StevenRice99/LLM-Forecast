Title: New coronavirus mutation raises vaccine questions
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
TRUE The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, particularly the E484K mutation, which has been detected in South Africa, Brazil, and Japan. This mutation has raised concerns among scientists as it may render certain vaccines less effective and increase the risk of reinfection. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 1. The E484K mutation has been associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, which could lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines. 2. The mutation occurs on the virus' spike protein, which allows it to bind more easily with human cell receptors, potentially increasing its infectiousness. 3. Researchers are concerned that further mutations could occur on top of the existing ones, which could lead to a decrease in vaccine effectiveness. 4. The article highlights the importance of accelerated vaccination programs to deliver as much immunity as possible, as fast as possible, to mitigate the impact of potential vaccine escape. These points are relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that the emergence of new variants could lead to an increase in cases and hospitalizations, particularly if vaccines become less effective.

Title: Ontario's homeless 5 times more likely to die of COVID-19, study finds
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
TRUE. The article provides valuable information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly among the homeless population. Key points include: Individuals recently homeless were over 20 times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19, over 10 times more likely to receive intensive care, and over five times more likely to die within 21 days of a positive test. The homeless population had a dramatically higher positivity rate, with tests coming back positive more than 75% more frequently than people with housing. The study found higher rates of co-morbidities, such as respiratory conditions and diabetes, among the homeless population, which increased their risk from COVID-19. Precarious living situations, including high population density in shelters, made it difficult for the homeless to physically distance and increased their risk of infection. These findings highlight the importance of considering the homeless population in forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, and the need to address the social determinants of health, such as housing, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on this vulnerable population.

Title: Ontario daily COVID-19 deaths expected to double in February, overwhelm health system: modelling
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Ontario health officials predict that without significant reductions in contacts, the provincial health system will be overwhelmed, and mortality will exceed the first wave totals, even with vaccination efforts. The daily COVID-19 mortality rate is expected to double from 50 deaths per day to about 100 deaths per day between mid-January and the end of February. If the rate of infections grows by 1%, Ontario hospital intensive care units could see occupancy related to COVID-19 jump to 500, and if the rate grows to 3%, ICU COVID-19 occupancy could soar over 1,000. The current COVID-19 infection growth rate is 1.2%, and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have increased by 72.1% over the last four weeks. Officials predict that if the number of infections continues at a growth rate of 1%, the province could see more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases daily by the end of February, and up to 10,000 cases if the infection rate is 3%. The modelling also forecasted that if the growth rate increases to 5%, the province could see about 20,000 daily cases per day by the middle of February, and over 40,000 cases per day if the growth rate reaches 7%. These values are crucial for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they provide insight into the potential trajectory of the pandemic and the impact on the healthcare system.

Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
TRUE. The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Eastern Ontario is experiencing a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases, with Cornwall leading the way in case count and hospitalizations. The Cornwall Community Hospital, designated as the regional COVID-19 ICU, is already under strain with three COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Hospitals in certain parts of the province are reaching capacity limits, prompting Ontario Health to instruct hospitals to reserve one-third of ICU beds for transfers from hospitals with no more room. Kingston Health Sciences Centre is preparing to increase capacity, but it's unclear what the need will be before receiving specific requests from Ontario Health. A field hospital is being developed to help with COVID-19 patients, but won't be ready for another few weeks. These points suggest that COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada are likely to increase, particularly in eastern Ontario, and that hospitals are preparing for a potential surge in cases. This information can be used to inform forecasting models and predict future hospitalization rates.

Title: 'Lockdown light' failed in Canada's hardest-hit regions. Here's what experts say should happen now
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Despite lockdown measures, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in Ontario and Quebec. Health experts attribute the failure to contain the spread of COVID-19 to inadequate and poorly timed restrictions. The current lockdown in Ontario is considered "lockdown light" and has not been aggressive enough to prevent the spread of the virus. Experts warn that the situation is critical, with ICU numbers, hospitalizations, and long-term care cases on a "scary trajectory". The Ontario government is preparing hospitals to transfer patients to different regions due to a shortage of beds and an unrelenting rise in COVID-19 levels. Stricter measures, such as a curfew, may be necessary to drive cases down to manageable levels. The success of stricter measures will depend on how well they are enforced and the level of public compliance. Experts emphasize the need for clear communication, consistent messaging, and a willingness to adapt and change approaches as needed to contain the pandemic. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Current lockdown measures are insufficient to contain the spread of COVID-19. Stricter measures, such as a curfew, may be necessary to drive cases down. Public compliance and enforcement of measures are critical to success. ICU numbers, hospitalizations, and long-term care cases are on a "scary trajectory". The Ontario government is preparing hospitals to transfer patients to different regions due to a shortage of beds.
