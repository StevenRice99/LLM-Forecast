Title: Canadian-led international study: Full-dose blood thinners benefit moderately ill COVID-19 patients
Publisher: UM Today
Trusted: False

The article discusses the results of two international clinical trials that tested the use of full-dose anticoagulation with heparin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The trials found that this treatment improved survival and reduced the need for vital organ support in moderately ill patients, but did not have the same positive effects in critically ill patients already on life support. The study had 1,074 critically ill and 2,219 moderately ill patients, and the results showed that full-dose heparin reduced the need for organ support in moderately ill patients compared to those who received lower doses. For critically ill patients, full-dose heparin was associated with worse outcomes. The conclusions of the trials have set a new standard of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the methods of collaboration between multiple platforms and countries could pave the way for future global clinical trial collaborations. The findings also highlight the potential for continuing research into improving health outcomes in COVID-19 and other diseases.

Title: Mandatory COVID-19 vaccines on university campuses: An obvious solution or a problem?
Publisher: The Conversation Indonesia
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses the approach of post-secondary institutions in Canada and the United States towards COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly whether to make it mandatory for students returning to campus. While some universities, like Seneca College in Ontario, are mandating vaccines, others such as the University of Toronto and University of Windsor, are focusing on promotion and providing accessible information. The authors, researchers with expertise in social and structural determinants of health, offer two scenarios and their concerns about mandatory vaccination. In the first scenario, universities view the unvaccinated as a threat and implement mandatory vaccination policies. They suggest offering online alternatives for unvaccinated students to protect privacy and avoid shaming, which can be counterproductive. The authors question what is owed to the unvaccinated and recommend flexibility as people return to workplaces and campuses. They also highlight the success of vaccine promotion and accessible options at the University of Windsor, which allows students time to decide and provides on-campus clinics. The authors support dialogue and community engagement, recommending that university leaders consult with students, faculty, and staff. They emphasize the need for universities to proactively plan for a gentler return and provide meaningful support to help the campus community recover from the challenging pandemic period. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion about mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations and offers insights into potential consequences and alternatives. It highlights the importance of respecting diverse student backgrounds, vaccine access, and individual choices while also prioritizing health and safety on campuses.

Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including key facts and guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic: Purpose: The policy brief provides guidance and recommendations for policymakers on how to make informed decisions about holding gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Definition of Gatherings: Gatherings are defined as events that bring people together in a specific location for a shared purpose over a defined period, such as sporting events, concerts, religious gatherings, or political demonstrations. Key Considerations: The risk of COVID-19 transmission during gatherings depends on various factors, including the intensity and closeness of contact between people, the duration of the gathering, the number of attendees, the location and setting, and the demographics and behavior of participants. The likelihood of COVID-19 cases, clusters, or outbreaks occurring as a result of a gathering is influenced by transmission dynamics in the area where the gathering takes place. The potential impact of a gathering on the local health system, including the risk of overwhelming healthcare services and resources, should be considered. WHO Guidance: WHO advises that the decision to hold or attend a gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on a thorough risk assessment and take into account the context and specific circumstances of the event. Risk management strategies should be implemented, including promoting behaviors that reduce transmission, applying protective measures, ensuring adherence to public health protocols, and considering the use of virtual formats or limiting the size and duration of gatherings. Key measures to reduce transmission risk include physical distancing, wearing masks, practicing respiratory and hand hygiene, ensuring adequate ventilation, and avoiding crowded and enclosed spaces. The involvement and communication with stakeholders, clear guidance for organizers and attendees, training of staff, and monitoring and evaluation of measures are emphasized by WHO. Forecasting COVID-19 Hospitalizations: While the article does not provide specific forecasts or models for COVID-19 hospitalizations, the information presented can help policymakers and health authorities make informed decisions that may indirectly impact hospitalization rates. By assessing the risk associated with gatherings and implementing appropriate measures, it is possible to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 outbreaks, which could help prevent a surge in hospitalizations. In conclusion, this policy brief offers guidance to policymakers on managing gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and stakeholder engagement. The brief also emphasizes the importance of considering local transmission dynamics and potential impacts on healthcare resources. While not providing specific hospitalization forecasts, the guidance aims to help manage the pandemic more effectively and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

Title: Why the delta variant is spreading COVID-19 so quickly — and what that means for Canada
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 7 days ago
The COVID-19 delta variant, first discovered in India in late 2020, is a highly contagious strain of the virus that has spread rapidly worldwide. It is now the dominant strain in Canada and the United States, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has dubbed it a "variant of concern." The delta variant is estimated to be 50% more contagious than the alpha variant, which was already 50% more contagious than the original virus strain. This means that each infected person can spread the virus to more people, allowing the variant to spread quickly through populations. The exact mechanism behind its increased transmissibility is not yet fully understood, but early research suggests that mutations in the spike protein of the virus may evade cellular immunity and increase its infectivity. The good news is that vaccines approved for use in Canada, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford, are still effective at warding off serious disease that leads to hospitalization or death. A recent study showed that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 88% effective against the delta variant, while two shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective. Data from Israel also showed that the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of severe disease by 91% and hospitalization by 88%. In the United States, the delta variant accounts for over 80% of new infections, and cases are spiking in areas with low vaccination rates. Unvaccinated individuals make up nearly 97% of all severe cases. In Canada, there are growing signs that the delta variant could lead to another surge in cases, even though a significant portion of the population is fully vaccinated. Experts hope that Canada can avoid the most dire outcomes, such as overwhelming pressure on hospitals and a high death toll, but it is important for people to continue taking precautions, such as wearing masks and social distancing.

New Brunswick has lifted all COVID-19 restrictions, including mandatory masks and gathering limits, 500 days after its first case and 499 days after declaring a state of emergency. The province has fully vaccinated 66.7% of its eligible population (those 12 and older) and administered over a million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jennifer Russell expects cases to increase but predicts they will be less severe due to high vaccination rates, resulting in few hospitalizations. Looking back at the pandemic's trajectory in New Brunswick, the province confirmed its first presumptive case on March 11, 2020, and declared a state of emergency eight days later, enforcing business closures and travel restrictions. In April, the government projected COVID-19-related deaths could range from 550 to 1,750 over 18-24 months without public health measures. A four-phase recovery plan was implemented, with the final "green phase" reached on July 30, 2022, marking the end of all restrictions. The article also highlights other key events, such as school closures, border checkpoints, and the impact on the economy and healthcare system. New Brunswick's journey through the pandemic has been challenging, but the high vaccination rate and cautious approach have allowed for a gradual return to normalcy.
