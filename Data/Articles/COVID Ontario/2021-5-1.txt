Posted: 2 days ago
Ontario plans to expand COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to all adults by the end of May, with shipments of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines expected to increase. The timeline depends on shipment arrivals and where individuals live. The province's vaccine task force aims to accelerate vaccinations, especially in hot-spot communities, and allocate 50% of doses to these areas in early May. While daily cases and hospitalizations show signs of flattening, intensive care patients will remain high and under pressure. The advisory table recommends effective sick pay, reducing open workplaces, and prioritizing high-risk communities to manage the situation. Test positivity rates are high, especially in Peel, Toronto, York, Durham, and Niagara regions. Hospitals in hot spots are over capacity, and surgeries are backlogged. A pilot project will distribute Pfizer vaccines to select pharmacies for individuals aged 55 and up. Ontario reported 3,871 new cases, 41 deaths, and a record number of admissions to intensive care. The seven-day average of daily cases has increased, and vaccine administration continues, with the province on track to provide first doses to 40% of adults by May 1.

Here is a summary of the article: Background: SARS-CoV-2 transmission in workplaces has caused a significant burden on essential workers and their families, contributing to community spread in Ontario. Workplace outbreaks have economic impacts and disrupt essential services. Paid sick leave is a public health measure that can reduce transmission, prevent outbreaks, and minimize financial losses. However, many essential workers in Ontario lack access to paid sick leave, putting them at risk. Impact of COVID-19 on Essential Workers: Workplaces, especially those with high concentrations of essential workers, have been significant sites of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In Ontario's Peel Region, workplaces accounted for 66% of community outbreaks from September to December 2020. Essential workers often work in multiple settings and have limited income supports. Overview of Paid Sick Leave Policies: The federal CRSB program provides $450 per week for up to four weeks for workers who miss work due to COVID-19, but it has limitations. Several provinces introduced unpaid sick leave, and Yukon is the only province offering a paid sick leave benefit. Internationally, some countries implemented or expanded paid sick leave during the pandemic. Evidence for Effectiveness: Paid sick leave reduces mobility and is associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 cases. In the US, a paid sick leave program was associated with a 50% decrease in confirmed COVID-19 cases per state per day. Lack of paid sick leave increases the risk of influenza-like illness, and paid sick leave policies have been effective in reducing respiratory infection transmission. Paid Sick Leave and COVID-19 Vaccination: Paid sick leave is associated with increased influenza vaccination rates, as workers are guaranteed paid time off to get immunized. Providing paid leave for COVID-19 vaccination can improve vaccination rates among essential workers. Economic Impact: Paid sick leave is crucial for public health containment and economic stability. It increases productivity, reduces absenteeism, and prevents outbreaks and workplace closures. Job losses have been higher in US states without paid sick leave during the pandemic. Ethical Principles: Paid sick leave aligns with public health ethics principles. It protects the public from harm, demonstrates reciprocity by supporting those facing a disproportionate burden, promotes equity by addressing social inequities, ensures proportionality in responding to health and economic threats, fosters solidarity, and enhances systemic resilience. Paid sick leave is a crucial public health intervention to support essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It reduces transmission, prevents outbreaks, and mitigates economic impacts. Implementing effective paid sick leave policies is essential to protect the health and well-being of essential workers and their communities.

The article announces amendments to British Columbia's Employment Standards Act, which provide workers with paid leave to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations. The amendment, Bill 3, ensures that both full-time and part-time employees can take up to three hours of paid leave to get each dose of the vaccine, with the amendment being retroactive to April 19, 2021. The purpose of this legislation is to remove barriers for workers wanting to get vaccinated and to promote community health and safety. This paid leave is intended to support British Columbians during the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain in place until it is repealed. The amendment also includes unpaid job-protected leave for workers who need more time to get vaccinated, such as those accompanying dependent family members or traveling long distances to their appointments. This amendment demonstrates the government's effort to encourage vaccinations and reduce potential disruptions to businesses and communities caused by COVID-19 outbreaks.

Title: How the spread of COVID-19 misinformation is undermining trust in public health
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Photos circulated on Facebook over the Easter weekend, falsely claiming that British Columbia's provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, was unmasked and traveling by helicopter to Victoria to visit family, violating her own guidelines. These claims were refuted by the B.C. Health Ministry, who confirmed that Henry flew back to Victoria, her place of residence, after a COVID-19 briefing in Vancouver. The incident reflects an "infodemic," a term used by the World Health Organization to describe the spread of misinformation during a disease outbreak. Experts warn that misinformation and disinformation undermine public institutions and endanger people's health, especially during a pandemic. According to Statistics Canada, 96% of Canadians encountered false or misleading information about COVID-19 online, and more than half shared information without verifying it. The impact of misinformation is exacerbated by the ease of spreading it on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. A survey by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) found that a majority of respondents believed in unproven COVID-19 treatments, highlighting the need for accessible and accurate information for all communities. The spread of misinformation about vaccine dangers and pandemic hoaxes contributes to vaccine hesitancy, as individuals delay or refuse inoculation. Addressing misinformation requires a diverse set of strategies, including utilizing different media platforms and providing information in multiple languages. False claims about public officials can lead to a breakdown of trust, making it challenging to rebuild effective communication channels.

Title: National COVID-19 Volunteer Recruitment Campaign – Horizontal Lessons Learned Review
Publisher: Canada.ca
Trusted: True
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article, including important facts that could be useful for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations: Background: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Health Canada recognized the need for a volunteer inventory to support the pandemic response, focusing on collaboration with provincial and territorial governments. The Government of Canada's response was based on principles such as collaboration, evidence-informed decision-making, proportionality, flexibility, and ethical decision-making. Objective: The review aimed to identify lessons learned and good practices in developing and administering the National COVID-19 Volunteer Recruitment Campaign and the volunteer inventory. Scope: The scope covered activities from March 31 to August 31, 2020, including creating the campaign poster, managing candidate referrals, and supporting the use of the volunteer inventory. Review Methodology: Document review, analysis of administrative and performance data, interviews/focus groups with internal and external stakeholders, and a survey sent to all screened-in volunteers. The Volunteer Inventory: Over 54,000 applications were received from across Canada and overseas. The inventory included 53,769 screened applicants with a diverse range of skills and expertise from all provinces and territories. Applicants could identify up to 4 specializations, with the top 10 including health sciences, nursing, business administration, medicine, and project management. Governance and Campaign Coordination: The campaign idea originated from Health Canada's COVID-19 task force and was communicated to the Public Service Commission (PSC) due to their expertise in large-scale recruitment campaigns. PSC's Executive Management Committee quickly assembled a project team and provided daily updates on campaign administration and progress. Operational and tactical-level governance was not fully established initially, but key elements were assessed and implemented shortly after the campaign launch. Application and Referral Processes: The campaign poster was developed and placed on the Government of Canada Jobs platform from April 2 to 24, 2020, offering opportunities in case tracking, contact tracing, health system surge capacity, and data collection/reporting. Over 54,000 Canadians applied, and an inventory was created to refer volunteers to support pandemic response efforts in areas like long-term care homes. New web and Excel-based applications were developed to manage referrals, and tools were created for inventory management, volunteer identification, and referral management. Use of the Inventory: The inventory was used to refer candidates to support pandemic response efforts, including the Canadian Red Cross in Quebec and Ontario. PSC employees worked with the Canadian Red Cross to assist in capacity-building efforts. Overall, 152 applicants were referred to the Canadian Red Cross, but none were offered positions due to availability and more qualified applicants from other sources. Lessons Learned: The campaign successfully created a diverse volunteer inventory to support pandemic response efforts. Effective governance and coordination were crucial, and PSC's expertise in recruitment was valuable. Flexibility and adaptability were essential due to the evolving nature of the pandemic. Continuous communication and collaboration between Health Canada, PSC, and other stakeholders ensured a coordinated response. This review provides insights into the successful development and administration of a national volunteer recruitment campaign during a public health crisis. The lessons learned can inform future pandemic response efforts or similar initiatives.

COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in 20 homeless shelters in Toronto, with over 320 unhoused individuals infected. Advocates are concerned about the rising case numbers, with 328 cases and 5 hospitalizations as of Sunday at 2 p.m. Street nurse Cathy Crowe attributed the rise to the more contagious variants and the congregate living settings in shelters. She called for improved infection control measures, more shelter hotels, random rapid testing, and accelerated vaccination efforts for the homeless population. The city has opened a second recovery center for unhoused individuals to isolate, and as of April 23, over 1,850 vaccinations have been administered to the unhoused in shelters. Dr. Vinita Dubey, the associate medical officer of health, emphasized the need for higher vaccination rates among the vulnerable population to prevent a resurgence of cases. The current hospitalization rate of 5 out of 328 cases (1.5%) suggests that hospitalizations could increase if case numbers continue to rise, especially with the spread of more contagious variants.

Title: Virtual 'spotting' could help keep drug users safe during COVID-19, U of T researchers say
Publisher: University of Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
A group of researchers at the University of Toronto is studying a remote supervised-consumption model called "spotting" to understand its benefits for people who use drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model involves a "spottee" consuming drugs while being monitored virtually by a "spotter," who is often a friend, family member, or acquaintance. The researchers have found that both spotters and spottees view the model as a way to enhance safety and privacy during the pandemic, especially with the added challenge of accessing safe injection sites. Participants in the study reported increased safety and a reduction in stigma, while spotters reported improved community connections and a sense of accomplishment. However, concerns about the model include fears of delayed emergency response and police intervention, especially for racialized individuals. The research team has provided recommendations to improve spotting programs, such as developing guidelines and awareness campaigns, and they plan to create educational materials with additional funding. The study aims to improve overdose prevention options and make spotting accessible to those without supervised consumption site access. This research is vital in addressing the rising number of fatal opioid overdoses in Canada during the pandemic.

A 13-year-old girl from Brampton, Ontario, Emily Victoria Viegas, died on April 22, 2021, after contracting COVID-19 and pneumonia. She is among the youngest Canadians to die from the virus, and her death has shocked and saddened the community and political leaders. Viegas's mother is currently in intensive care with COVID-19, and her younger brother is also infected but doing okay. Dr. Andrew Healey, from the William Osler Health System, expressed his condolences and noted that he had recently admitted five people with COVID-19 to the ICU, three of whom had no previous health conditions. Ontario's chief coroner, Dr. Dirk Huyer, confirmed that the province is investigating the teen's death. Many healthcare professionals have observed that the demographics of COVID-19 patients in ICUs have skewed younger during the third wave, with essential workers and their family members being affected. While severe illness and death from COVID-19 among young Canadians are rare, Viegas's death highlights the potential severity of the virus. Leaders, including Premier Doug Ford and Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, have expressed their condolences and emphasized the devastating impact of the virus.
