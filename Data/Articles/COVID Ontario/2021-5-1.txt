Title: How often are Canadian kids actually getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
More young people (youth and children) are getting infected with COVID-19 during the third wave.
Hospital admissions among youth have increased: 1% of all COVID-related hospitalizations in Quebec and around four children in hospital at any one time at SickKids in Toronto.
Serious illness or death among youth remains rare, but medical experts say parents need to remain vigilant since it will be a while before Canadian kids get the protection of vaccinations.
Certain symptoms should prompt concern: excessive vomiting, fewer trips to the bathroom (dehydration), unusual or laboured breathing, and coughing that makes it hard for children to catch their breath.

Comparison to other age groups: Hospitalizations among younger adults (69 and under) showed a rising trend, suggesting different dynamics between age groups.
Public health trends: The gap between older and younger Canadians is widening in terms of case growth, with the latter experiencing a rise in new infections.
