Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are leveling off, but ICU occupancy is expected to continue rising, with a current occupancy of over 800 and a projected decrease to around 500 by the end of May under the best-case scenario. The number of patients in ICU is still high due to the second wave, and the third wave has put additional pressure on the healthcare system. The cumulative pandemic-related backlog of surgeries stands at over 250,000 cases, posing an "enormous challenge" to the healthcare system. Hotspots such as Peel Region, Toronto, and York Region continue to show high positivity rates, with Peel Region having a seven-day average of 18.1% on April 24. Cases are decreasing faster than expected, but may begin to rise in June, even in the best-case scenario. The reproduction rate of the virus is at 0.9, indicating a deceleration in cases, but case counts remain high. Vaccination numbers continue to grow, with over 4.5 million doses administered and 36.6% of Ontarians having received at least one dose. Prioritizing hotspot communities for vaccinations and limiting essential workplaces and keeping sick workers at home will help control cases. These points provide valuable information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, including the current state of hospitalizations and ICU occupancy, the impact of hotspots, and the effects of vaccination efforts.

Title: How often are Canadian kids actually getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19?
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: There have been a few cases of children and teens dying from COVID-19 in Canada, including a 13-year-old girl in Ontario. Despite the emergence of variants, serious illness or death among youth remains rare, with only three COVID-19 deaths among people 19 and under in Ontario over the course of the pandemic. However, there is emerging data showing that more young people are getting infected, hospitalized, and dying from COVID-19, with some hospitals experiencing a spike in youth admissions. Medical experts attribute this to high community transmission levels and the fact that children and teens are not yet vaccinated. The number of serious cases among kids remains "extremely low," with children and youth making up nearly 20% of COVID-19 cases but less than 2% of hospitalizations in Canada. Experts recommend that parents remain vigilant and maintain protective measures, such as minimizing interactions with people from outside their home, physical distancing, and mask-wearing, especially since children and teens will remain unprotected for the foreseeable future. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: Number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among children and youth Community transmission levels Vaccination rates among children and teens Emerging evidence on the transmissibility and severity of variants of concern Recommendations from medical experts on maintaining protective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Title: Ford’s latest waffle on paid sick days hits areas like Malton hardest
Publisher: The Pointer
Trusted: False
Posted: 3 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it highlights the challenges faced by the Malton community in Mississauga, which has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The article provides valuable information on the community's high COVID-19 positivity rate, low vaccination rate, and limited access to healthcare resources, including vaccination sites and testing facilities. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 positivity rate: 24.04% in the L4T postal code (Malton) Vaccination rate: 17.29% of residents in the L4T postal code (Malton) had at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of April 19 Hospitalization rate: 3.03 residents out of every 1,000 in the L4T postal code (Malton) had been hospitalized or died due to COVID-19 Limited access to healthcare resources, including vaccination sites and testing facilities, in the Malton community High rates of employment in the surrounding essential labour market, which may contribute to the spread of the virus These values can be used to inform forecasting models and highlight the need for targeted interventions to address the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in the Malton community and other similar communities in Ontario.

Title: Pushing Ontario’s ICUs to the brink: How some hospitals are preparing for the worst
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: The number of COVID-19 patients in Ontario hospital ICUs has reached an all-time high of 875, with 589 people on ventilators. The province's ICU capacity is strained, with staffing shortages, particularly a lack of ICU-trained nurses. Discussions are underway about the possible need to triage life-saving care, with a "critical care triage protocol" being considered. The protocol would prioritize patients based on their likelihood of survival, with three levels of triage: + Level 1: deprioritizes critical care resources for patients with a predicted mortality greater than 80%. + Level 2: deprioritizes critical care resources for patients with a predicted mortality greater than 50%. + Level 3: patients with predicted mortality of 30% (or a 70% chance of surviving beyond a year) will not receive critical care. Ontario's latest modelling predictions suggest a peak of at least 1,500 virus cases in ICUs by the first week of May, which could push the province's total 2,000-ICU-bed capacity over the edge. The article highlights the importance of adapting and expanding the healthcare system to avoid the worst-case scenario, including transferring patients to other hospitals, ramping down elective surgeries, and deploying additional medical staff. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, as they provide insight into the current state of the healthcare system, the potential need for triage, and the efforts being made to adapt and expand capacity.

Title: Deaths, hospitalizations dropping among oldest Canadians as COVID-19 vaccinations ramp up
Publisher: CBC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the oldest Canadians (80+ years old) are dropping at a faster rate than in younger adults, indicating the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. The vaccination rate among Canadians 80+ years old reached 10% by February, leading to a significant decrease in weekly cases and hospitalizations in this age group. Hospitalizations among older Americans have plunged more than 70% since the start of the year, and deaths in that group have also decreased, suggesting that vaccination efforts are working. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, noted that the Rt (reproduction number) has dipped below one, indicating that the number of new cases may decline countrywide as vaccinations ramp up. To achieve herd immunity, vaccinations in hot spots where infection rates are high should be prioritized, particularly in lower-income communities that have been hard-hit throughout the pandemic. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they suggest that vaccination efforts are effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among older adults. Additionally, prioritizing vaccinations in hot spots and lower-income communities may help to reduce transmission and hospitalizations in these areas.
