Title: Back to the future? Airline sector poised for change post-COVID-19
Publisher: McKinsey
Trusted: False
Posted: 1 day ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the airline industry, with revenues plummeting by around 40% in 2020. The sector is expected to remain smaller for years, with traffic not returning to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. The pandemic has also led to several longer-term effects on aviation, including increased focus on hygiene and safety standards and the continued digitalization of the travel experience. One of the key shifts in the aviation industry is the expectation that leisure trips will fuel the recovery, while business travel is expected to take longer to bounce back. Airlines should reevaluate the economics of their operations, particularly long-haul flights, and consider pricing and network changes to adapt to the increased share of leisure traffic. The pandemic has also led to staggering debt levels for many airlines, which will likely result in ticket price increases. Government bailouts have also led to increased state ownership and influence in the sector. Airlines should collaborate constructively with regulators and shape the evolution of the industry. There will be a greater disparity in performance among airlines, with some proactively restructuring for efficiency while others lag. Airlines should aim higher in IT and digital investment to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiency. The aircraft market may be oversupplied due to increased production before the pandemic and the return of relatively new aircraft by some carriers. Carriers with strong finances can consider acting countercyclically by locking in orders for new aircraft or confirming operating leases during this period of low demand. On the other hand, air freight is currently facing undersupply, and carriers can explore shortto medium-term opportunities to boost their cargo services. However, airlines need to be agile and cautious about developing a large freighter fleet due to high fixed costs and unpredictable demand. While vaccinations provide some relief, the recovery of air traffic will take several years. Airlines can take steps now to adapt to the transformed sector, including investing in digitalization, exploring cargo opportunities, and locking in aircraft deals during low demand periods.

Here is a summary of the article: The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on telework and productivity in Canada. The key findings include: 32% of Canadian employees aged 15-69 worked from home in 2021, up from 4% in 2016. 90% of new teleworkers reported being at least as productive at home as in their usual workplace, with 58% accomplishing the same amount of work per hour and 32% accomplishing more. Public administration and health care sectors had higher percentages of workers reporting increased productivity, while goods-producing industries and educational services had lower percentages. 80% of new teleworkers preferred to work at least half of their hours from home post-pandemic, with 41% favoring a half-and-half split and 39% wanting to work most or all hours at home. Teachers were the most likely group to prefer working outside the home, with 54% expressing this preference. The first two conditions for sustained high rates of telework post-pandemic (employee productivity and preference) appear largely satisfied in Canada as of February 2021. Employers will need to accommodate diverse preferences for telework, and the increased feasibility of telework may expand the pool of potential employers for job seekers. Overall, the article suggests that telework has been productive for many Canadian employees during the pandemic and that a significant portion of the workforce would like to continue working from home, at least part-time, post-pandemic.

Title: Canada's nursing homes have worst record for COVID-19 deaths among wealthy nations: report
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant weaknesses in Canada's long-term care homes, resulting in a high number of outbreaks and deaths relative to other wealthy nations. According to a report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), 69% of Canada's COVID-19 deaths occurred in nursing homes, far higher than the international average of 41%. Between March 2020 and February 2021, over 80,000 residents and staff in Canadian long-term care homes were infected, with outbreaks in 2,500 homes leading to 14,000 resident deaths. The report also highlights a 19% increase in all causes of death among care home residents in certain provinces during the pandemic, indicating a broader impact on overall health. The study's findings suggest that the quality of care in Canadian nursing homes suffered during the pandemic, with reduced medical care and fewer visits from doctors and transfers to hospitals. Additionally, lockdowns and isolation measures took a toll on residents' mental health, with the proportion of residents experiencing depression increasing among those who had no contact with loved ones. The second wave of the pandemic in Canada was more severe than the first, with a 62% increase in COVID-19 infections among nursing home residents. Ontario and Quebec were particularly hard hit, with a large proportion of homes experiencing outbreaks. Staffing shortages in long-term care homes were exacerbated by the pandemic, and the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces personnel to some of the most severely impacted homes revealed issues with infection control practices, resident care, and staffing. Experts emphasize the need for better funding and national standards for long-term care homes to prevent future tragedies. While provincial inquiries are ongoing and the federal government has promised new national standards, concrete changes are yet to be implemented.

Title: COVID-19 stress toll is a family affair: 4 ways to support mothers’ mental health
Publisher: University of Calgary
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of children and their families, with mothers bearing the brunt of the burden. The article presents research findings from the All Our Families Study, which followed nearly 3,000 Canadian mothers and their children over the past 12 years. The study found that between May and July of 2020, mothers reported higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to before the pandemic, with a nearly two-fold increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms. The increase in maternal mental health difficulties was particularly high among mothers who experienced job loss, family income loss, or difficulty accessing childcare. The pandemic has also exacerbated existing inequalities, with women more likely to be precariously employed, earn less income, and shoulder the majority of household tasks and childcare responsibilities. Low-income women and women of color are even more disadvantaged. To address these challenges and promote family well-being, the article proposes four strategies: 1. Increase access to mental health supports for mothers, including tele-mental health services that can be provided online or by phone. 2. Provide ongoing support for family incomes, as loss or disruption of income was a major stressor associated with increased mental health symptoms. 3. Promote shared responsibilities for homeschooling, childcare, and household tasks between mothers and fathers, as mothers who struggled to balance multiple roles had higher rates of depression and anxiety. 4. Ensure stable, safe, and affordable childcare and schooling for children, as the closure of schools and daycares during the pandemic had a devastating impact on families. The pandemic has taken a toll on families, particularly mothers, and the article emphasizes the need for institutional support in addition to support from friends, family, and community. Stable supports such as financial assistance, predictable childcare, and schooling are crucial for caregivers and the well-being of the entire family. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is important to consider the mental health impact of the pandemic on mothers and families. The increased stress and responsibilities on mothers may lead to more hospitalizations if their mental health deteriorates further. Additionally, the lack of stable childcare and schooling options may result in more hospitalizations as parents, particularly mothers, may struggle to balance work and caring for their children.

Title: COVID-19 Hospitalizations, ICU Admissions and Deaths Associated with the New Variants of Concern
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Background: Ontario entered the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic around March 1, 2021, driven by the rapid spread of Variants of Concern (VOCs), particularly the B.1.1.7 variant. As of March 28, 2021, VOCs accounted for an estimated 67% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, with a weekly incidence of 71.4 new infections per 100,000 people. Findings: A retrospective cohort study in Ontario found that infections caused by VOCs were associated with a 62% increase in hospitalizations, a 114% increase in ICU admissions, and a 40% increase in deaths compared to early variants of SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis of studies from Ontario, the UK, and Denmark showed consistent results, with VOCs increasing the risk of hospitalization by 63%, ICU admission by 103%, and death by 56%. The risk of severe outcomes was elevated across all age groups. The number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions during the third wave has surpassed the thresholds seen at the start of the province-wide lockdown in December 2020. As of March 28, 2021, hospital occupancy was 21% higher, and ICU occupancy was 28% higher than at the start of the lockdown. Patients aged 59 and younger now account for a higher proportion of ICU admissions compared to the second wave. Interpretation: VOCs significantly increase the risk of severe outcomes compared to early variants, leading to a higher burden on the healthcare system. The third wave of the pandemic in Ontario is resulting in more hospitalizations and ICU admissions than the second wave, even with similar case numbers. The impact of VOCs on the healthcare system is expected to worsen, given the time lag between infections and severe outcomes.

Title: Why Is There a Chip Shortage? Covid-19, Surging Demand Cause Semiconductor Shortfall
Publisher: Bloomberg
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The global shortage of computer chips, also known as semiconductors, has far-reaching implications for various industries, including smartphones, PCs, and automobiles. The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly increased demand for certain industries, causing a near-term supply shock. Lead times for chips have surpassed the previous peak in 2018, with an average of 15 weeks. The crunch has affected major car manufacturers and highlighted the dominance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the chip-making market. The demand for semiconductors has grown over the past decade, driven by smartphone usage and computing power. The use of chips in once-mechanical machines, such as cars, has also increased. Automotive electronics are estimated to account for 45% of a car's manufacturing cost by 2030. The pandemic caused sharp swings in orders, making it difficult for chipmakers to match capacity with demand, resulting in production halts for carmakers in 2021 and shortages of consumer electronics like PlayStations and Xboxes. The cost of chipmaking and keeping up with technological advancements has also contributed to the problem. Logic chips from companies like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Apple are the most complex and expensive, and their fabrication is concentrated among a small number of foundries, with TSMC and Samsung being the largest players. The shortage has led to calls for domestic chip-making capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, but resolving the issue may take years as building new fabrication facilities is a complex and time-consuming process.
