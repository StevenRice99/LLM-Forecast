Publisher: Cranbrook Townsman
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased by over 40% in the past two weeks. The Ontario Science Advisory Table suggests that stay-at-home orders can control the third wave of COVID-19, driven by rising rates of variants of concern. Short-term case projections depend on public health measures and vaccination rates. The province's vaccine rollout is not effectively reaching high-risk communities, delaying its impact. The spread of variants threatens the health system's ability to handle regular intensive care admissions and care for all patients. Important values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 40% increase in hospitalizations over the past two weeks Rising rates of variants of concern Vaccination rates Effectiveness of public health measures (e.g. stay-at-home orders) Vaccine rollout in high-risk communities

Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: As of Wednesday, there were 40 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa, with 11 in ICU, up from 27 and 6 two weeks prior. Ottawa's hospitals are at 100% capacity, and health officials are concerned about the rising number of hospitalizations, particularly among younger people. The number of hospitalizations is expected to rise due to the spread of more contagious and serious coronavirus variants. 50% of Ottawa's current cases are variants of concern, and a smaller share are in hospital. Younger people are being hospitalized, with 30% of total hospitalizations being people under 60, including 123 people in their 50s, 54 people in their 40s, and 46 people in their 30s. The city is still in the process of vaccinating residents aged 70 and older, and it may take months to reach younger age groups. These values are important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as they indicate a rising trend in hospitalizations, particularly among younger people, and a potential strain on hospital capacity.

Title: Doctors urge Ontario to rethink ICU capacity as key lockdown indicator
Publisher: CTV News
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The article highlights the following key points: 1. ICU occupancy in Ontario has hit a record high, with 430 COVID-19 patients in ICU beds. 2. The variants of concern are driving the third wave of the pandemic, leading to more severe cases and increased hospitalizations. 3. The number of patients requiring ICU care is doubling with each individual infection, and the patients ending up in hospital and ICUs are younger. 4. The impact of the virus has been disproportionate, infecting those with highest exposure risk, commonly from lower-income and racialized communities. 5. The situation is untenable, even with unlimited ICU beds, as allowing the variants to spread exponentially is unethical. 6. The lack of properly trained nurses and doctors to staff ICU beds and tend to patients is a major concern. 7. Important supplies, such as tocilizumab, are beginning to run low, and rationing may be necessary. These points suggest that the current situation in Ontario is critical, and new public health measures are required to curb the spread of the virus and prevent further hospitalizations. The article provides valuable insights for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, and highlights the need for immediate action to address the crisis.

Title: Quebec and Ontario in talks to standardize COVID-19 rules across Ottawa-Gatineau region
Publisher: CTV News Montreal
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the situation in the Ottawa-Gatineau region, which is located on the border of Ontario and Quebec. Key points relevant to forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario include: The Outaouais region, which includes Gatineau, has seen a significant increase in COVID-19 cases, with 84 new cases on Monday and 57 new cases on Tuesday. The region is currently under a 9:30 p.m. nightly curfew and has strict rules for restaurants, but the Quebec government is considering tighter rules, including an earlier curfew. The Outaouais region has low hospital capacity, which increases concerns about hospitalizations. The Quebec government is discussing standardizing COVID-19 rules with the Ontario government to address the situation in the Ottawa-Gatineau region. The article mentions that the most important number to the province is not new cases, but hospitalizations, and especially predicted hospitalizations. These points suggest that the situation in the Ottawa-Gatineau region could have implications for COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, particularly if the Quebec government implements tighter rules or if there is increased transmission across the border.

Title: COVID-19 Hospitalizations, ICU Admissions and Deaths Associated with the New Variants of Concern
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Summary: The article discusses the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada, which began around March 1, 2021. The dominant variant of concern (VOC) in Ontario is the B.1.1.7 variant, which is at least 40% more transmissible than early variants of SARS-CoV-2. The article presents data from a retrospective cohort study of 26,314 people in Ontario who were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February 7 and March 11, 2021. The study found that infections due to VOCs were associated with a 62% relative increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, a 114% relative increase in ICU admissions, and a 40% relative increase in COVID-19 deaths. The article also presents data from a meta-analysis of cohort studies in Ontario, the United Kingdom, and Denmark, which found that people infected with VOCs had a 63% higher risk of hospitalization, a doubling of the risk of ICU admission, and a 56% higher risk of all-cause death. The article notes that the risk increase is particularly pronounced 14 to 28 days after a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which will result in delays until the full burden to the health care system becomes apparent. As of March 28, 2021, hospital occupancy was 21% higher and ICU occupancy was 28% higher than at the start of the province-wide lockdown on December 26, 2020. Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 62% relative increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with VOCs 114% relative increase in ICU admissions associated with VOCs 40% relative increase in COVID-19 deaths associated with VOCs 63% higher risk of hospitalization associated with VOCs (from meta-analysis) Doubling of the risk of ICU admission associated with VOCs (from meta-analysis) 56% higher risk of all-cause death associated with VOCs (from meta-analysis) 21% higher hospital occupancy as of March 28, 2021, compared to December 26, 2020 28% higher ICU occupancy as of March 28, 2021, compared to December 26, 2020

Title: New data shows COVID-19 pandemic now 'completely out of control' in Ontario, key scientific adviser says
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: New daily infections have reached the same number as at the height of the second wave. The number of people hospitalized is now 21% higher than at the start of the last province-wide lockdown. ICU occupancy is 28% higher. Variants of concern now account for 67% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, which are associated with a more than 60% increased risk of hospitalization, a doubled risk of admission to intensive care, and a 56% increased risk of death. The percentage of COVID-19 patients in ICUs who are younger than 60 is about 50% higher. Experts warn that a widespread lockdown, coupled with other measures such as paid sick leave and encouraging Ontarians to avoid movement between regions, is necessary to prevent a dire scenario from unfolding over the next few weeks. These values suggest a significant increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, and highlight the need for urgent action to prevent further spread of the virus.

Title: COVID-19 variants already having 'substantial impact' on Ontario health-care system, report finds
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting: Hospitalizations are 21% higher than when Ontario entered a province-wide lockdown in December. Variants of concern account for 67% of all cases in the province and are associated with: + 63% increased risk of hospitalization + 103% increased risk of ICU admission + 56% increased risk of death Younger people (under 50) are being hospitalized at a higher rate, with 46% of new ICU admissions involving people aged 59 or younger. There are currently 382 people receiving treatment for COVID-19 in intensive care in Ontario hospitals, approaching the second wave peak of 400. Case counts are surging, with the number of new cases, hospital and ICU occupancy surpassing prior thresholds seen at the start of the province-wide lockdown on December 26, 2020. The report warns that the new variants will result in a "considerably higher burden" to the health care system than was observed during the second wave, with significant delays until the full burden becomes apparent (14-28 days after diagnosis). These values can inform forecasting models to predict the potential increase in hospitalizations and ICU admissions in Ontario, particularly among younger populations, and the potential impact on the healthcare system.

This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the article, highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: New COVID-19 cases: 2,453 (an increase from 2,169 cases on Friday) Seven-day average of new cases: 1,944 (up from 1,532 a week ago and 1,337 two weeks ago) Hospitalizations: 985 patients (up from 913 on Friday and the highest level since February 6) ICU patients: 365 Ventilator patients: 192 Positivity rate: 4.5% (based on 61,005 tests processed in the last 24 hours) COVID-19 variant cases: 35 new cases confirmed, including 29 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant Vaccination update: 308,301 people fully vaccinated, 1,916,332 doses administered, and 77,740 doses administered in the last day. These values suggest an increasing trend in new cases and hospitalizations, which is a concern for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The positivity rate and COVID-19 variant cases also provide important context for understanding the spread of the disease. The vaccination update provides a glimmer of hope, but the pace of vaccination may not be enough to offset the increasing case numbers.
