This article reports on the dire situation with COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada. The main points are:
According to a report by the Central East Region of the Canadian Society of Intensive Care Medicine (CCSO), there are currently over 400 patients in intensive care units across the region, with many more expected.
At Humber River Hospital's Wilson campus, 43 patients are being treated for COVID-19 in the ICU, with 24 of them having severe cases. Similarly, at Markham Stouffville Hospital, half of the 24 ICU patients have COVID-19.
Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital is using its ICU to exclusively treat COVID patients and has 32 out of 35 available beds filled.
Dr. Nathan Warner from Michael Garron Hospital warns that if new restrictions are not implemented soon, the number of COVID patients in ICUs could top 500.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath says another lockdown is inevitable at this point due to the government's failure to act on advice from science experts.
The president of the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA), Anthony Dale, describes the situation as "the biggest health-care crisis" in modern Ontario history. He warns that if more than 2,000 ICU patients are reached, there would be a historic mobilization of healthcare workers to staff critical care beds, leading to widespread cancellations of elective or scheduled surgery.
Dale also notes that hospitals may struggle to maintain quality care for critically ill patients due to staffing levels and other factors.

Title: COVID-19 Hospitalizations, ICU Admissions and Deaths Associated with the New Variants of Concern
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
This Science Brief discusses the impact of new Variants of Concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 on COVID-19 outcomes in Ontario, Canada. Here's a summary of the key findings:
1. Increased risk of hospitalization: New VOCs are associated with a 103% increase in the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 compared to early variants.
2. Increased risk of ICU admission: The new VOCs have led to a 63% increase in the risk of ICU admission, indicating more severe disease.
3. Increased risk of death: The new VOCs are associated with a 56% increase in the risk of death due to COVID-19.
4. Higher hospital and ICU occupancy: As of March 28, 2021, hospital occupancy was 21% higher and ICU occupancy 28% higher than at the start of the province-wide lockdown on December 26, 2020.
5. Shift in age distribution: Patients aged 59 years and younger now account for 46% of new COVID-19 admissions to ICUs, up from 30% in the week prior to the lockdown.
The analysis suggests that the new VOCs have led to a more severe disease course and increased burden on the healthcare system. The study used a retrospective cohort design, analyzing cases reported between February 7 and March 11, 2021, with a focus on individuals tested for VOCs. The findings are based on data from Ontario, Canada, but the implications may be relevant to other regions as well.
The study's methods included:
A retrospective cohort study using cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in CCM/iPHIS
Exclusion of long-term care residents due to high vaccination rates and low likelihood of severe disease
Logistic regression models to evaluate associations between VOC SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes
Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis to combine adjusted estimates from individual studies
The study's findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance, preparedness, and adaptation in response to emerging variants of concern.
