Title: Paxlovid Helps People With Mild COVID-19 Symptoms
Publisher: Healthline
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, as it discusses the effectiveness of antiviral medications, specifically Paxlovid, in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The study, which included 41 trials and over 18,000 people with non-severe COVID-19, found that taking Paxlovid likely led to 46 fewer hospital admissions per 1,000 cases compared to standard care or a placebo. This information can be useful in forecasting hospitalizations in Ontario, as it suggests that increased access to and use of Paxlovid could lead to a reduction in hospitalizations. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, include: 46 fewer hospital admissions per 1,000 cases for those taking Paxlovid 5 times less likely to be hospitalized and 10 times less likely to die from COVID-19 for those taking Paxlovid Importance of early testing and access to Paxlovid for at-risk individuals This information can be used to inform forecasting models and estimate the potential impact of increased Paxlovid use on hospitalizations in Ontario.

Title: Alberta hospitals might buckle under the next COVID wave, doctors worry
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary of the key points: Alberta is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the BA.5 subvariant, with Calgary being a hotspot. Wastewater data shows a significant increase in SARS-CoV2 RNA particles, indicating high transmission in the community. Positivity rates and hospitalizations are rising in Alberta, with a concern that this wave may lead to a surge in admissions, similar to what was seen in Ontario and the UK. Frontline healthcare workers are reporting early signs of this surge in emergency rooms, which are already stressed and overwhelmed. Experts predict hospitalizations will continue to rise, with most patients requiring oxygen support, but fewer requiring intensive care compared to previous Omicron waves. The article mentions that Ontario is a couple of weeks ahead of Alberta in terms of the surge, which could provide insight into what Ontario's hospitalization trends may look like in the coming weeks. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: BA.5 subvariant transmission rates Wastewater data trends Positivity rates Hospitalization rates ICU admission rates Vaccination rates (particularly fourth doses) These values can help inform forecasting models and provide insight into the potential trajectory of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Antivirals can prevent hospitalisations if COVID-19 patients are treated early
Publisher: Scimex
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
This article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. The key points for forecasting are: The antiviral treatments nirmatrelvir–ritonavir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir can prevent hospitalizations if given while COVID-19 is still mild. Nirmatrelvir–ritonavir likely reduces hospitalizations by 46.2 people per 1,000 treated, and molnupiravir likely reduces hospitalizations by 16.3 people per 1,000. The trials focused on unvaccinated Delta patients, and more research is needed on how vaccinated Omicron patients respond to the treatments. The findings suggest that nirmatrelvir–ritonavir may be superior to molnupiravir for some outcomes. These values can be used to inform forecasting models of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada, particularly in terms of the potential impact of antiviral treatments on hospitalization rates. However, it's important to note that the commentary authors highlight the need for ongoing research to inform clinical and policy decisions, especially in the context of a changing disease landscape with evolving virus and population dynamics.

Title: Ottawa doctor hosts Jabapalooza to administer COVID-19 fourth doses
Publisher: CTV News Ottawa
Trusted: False
Posted: 6 days ago
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 37 people were in hospital as of Friday in Ottawa. Three new deaths have been linked to COVID-19 in the last week in Ottawa. Wastewater data is trending down, but COVID-19 numbers are still higher than a month ago. Dr. Dale Kalina, an infectious diseases physician, expects to see more waves, especially as we head into fall. Second booster doses are open to those 18 and older in Ontario, which may impact hospitalization rates. These values suggest that while COVID-19 numbers are still elevated, the trend may be slowing down. However, the expectation of more waves, especially in the fall, and the continued high numbers compared to a month ago, suggest that hospitalizations may remain a concern in the coming months.
