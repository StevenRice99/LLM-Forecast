Title: What happened when COVID-19 skeptical legal cases made it to court in Ontario?
Publisher: Global News
Trusted: False
Posted: Today
Here is a summary of the article: The article discusses various legal challenges to COVID-19 restrictions in Ontario, Canada, including mandates, vaccines, and lockdowns. It highlights the case of a group of protesters loyal to the QAnon conspiracy theory who attempted to serve a cease-and-desist letter to a public health official in Peterborough, Ontario. While this particular group did not file any legal paperwork, the article notes that several other COVID-19-related cases have been dismissed by provincial courts and the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. For example, a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging that COVID-19 was a global conspiracy designed to promote sterilization was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of Ontario. The court described the claim as "frivolous, vexatious, and an abuse of process." Similarly, an appeal against Ottawa's mask mandate by a resident who provided internet research to support her views was also thrown out by a judge. The article also mentions other legal challenges related to COVID-19 policies, including mandatory vaccination requirements for city employees in Toronto. A case brought by groups opposing lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, claiming that they were forms of martial law, appeared to be dormant as of May 2021. However, it is still technically active. Despite the lack of success in these legal challenges, a lawyer commented that as more scientific research is completed in the post-pandemic period, some decisions could be revisited by courts if new evidence supports reconsideration. To forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations, experts rely on various factors, including vaccination rates, the prevalence of variants, and the implementation of public health measures. While legal challenges to COVID-19 restrictions have not had much success in Ontario, the article suggests that public health measures, such as mask mandates and vaccination policies, are important tools in managing the pandemic and reducing hospitalizations.

Title: XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant: Questions patients may have
Publisher: American Medical Association
Trusted: False
Posted: 2 days ago
The COVID-19 Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, nicknamed "Kraken," has become the dominant strain in the United States, accounting for about 43% of cases as of January 13. This subvariant is highly transmissible due to mutations that enhance its binding to cells and evasion of immunity. Cases have risen rapidly, and it is now the most prevalent strain in the Northeast, with over 80% of cases in New York and New Jersey. Symptoms of XBB.1.5 are similar to previous Omicron subvariants, ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to more severe respiratory issues. Experts believe that COVID-19 symptoms have become less severe over time, possibly due to immunity from vaccines or prior infections. However, the risk of long COVID remains. The updated COVID-19 bivalent booster provides added protection against severe illness and hospitalization, and treatments like oral antivirals are expected to be effective against XBB.1.5. To protect against this subvariant, vaccination, mask-wearing, avoiding crowded spaces, and physical distancing are recommended.

Title: What the end of the COVID-19 emergencies in the US means
Publisher: ABC News
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
The end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US on May 11, 2023, marks a significant shift, with potential impacts on millions of Americans' access to healthcare and COVID-19-related costs. While public health experts attribute this decision to high immunity levels and milder Omicron variants, it will have several key consequences: 1. Loss of Medicaid access for millions: Between 5-14 million Americans could lose their Medicaid coverage, with an estimated 7 million at risk of falling through the cracks during the renewal process. 2. New costs for COVID-19 tests and treatments: Americans will have to pay for at-home rapid tests, which were previously free, and may face costs for testing at clinics or doctors' offices. Treatments like Paxlovid will eventually incur higher costs once the federal government's supply runs out. 3. Telehealth access preserved for Medicare recipients: Congress has ensured continued telehealth access for Medicare users for the next two years, while those with private insurance will depend on state laws and insurance company policies. 4. Harder to track pandemic data: The end of the emergency measures may lead to a less transparent picture of the pandemic, with states no longer mandated to share COVID-19 data with the CDC, potentially hindering the ability to anticipate infection surges and respond promptly. 5. Title 42 and immigration implications: The end of the public health emergency is linked to Title 42, which has been used to expel migrants seeking asylum based on COVID-19 concerns. The issue is currently before the Supreme Court. 6. Student loan debt cancellation complexities: The Biden administration's argument for student loan debt cancellation relies in part on the COVID-19 national emergency, and ending the emergency may legally complicate this position. 7. Continued risk of infections and deaths: Despite the end of the emergency, COVID-19 infections and deaths persist, with 300-500 daily deaths in the US, underscoring the need for continued vigilance. While this shift signifies a transition to an endemic period, experts caution that the future is unpredictable, and the impact on hospitalizations is uncertain.

Title: Alberta shelves preventative COVID-19 therapy, Evusheld, as resistant variants take hold
Publisher: CBC.ca
Trusted: False
Posted: 4 days ago
Alberta Health Services is no longer recommending Evusheld, a preventative COVID-19 treatment for immunocompromised individuals, due to its ineffectiveness against the latest subvariants, particularly XBB.1.5. This decision aligns with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's removal of authorization for Evusheld. Dr. Alain Tremblay, a respirologist, expresses concern for immunocompromised individuals losing a protection option as Evusheld is the latest monoclonal antibody drug to become ineffective against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, he reassures that key COVID-19 treatments, such as the oral medication Paxlovid and the IV drug Remdesivir, remain effective against the latest subvariants. Alberta Health shares that 11,900 Albertans have received Paxlovid, and the province has 74,600 treatment courses available. Dr. Lynora Saxinger emphasizes the importance of booster shots for those with weakened immune systems and early testing and treatment for effective care. Alberta Health Services has updated and loosened eligibility criteria for Paxlovid and Remdesivir, allowing healthcare providers more flexibility in patient assessment.

Title: What to do if you have COVID-19 or flu
Publisher: Mayo Clinic Health System
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: Most people with mild COVID-19 or flu symptoms can manage their illness at home without seeing a doctor. However, testing is encouraged due to the similarity in symptoms between the two illnesses, and it is possible to be infected with both simultaneously. Common symptoms of COVID-19 and flu include fever, muscle aches, respiratory symptoms, and fatigue. People with mild symptoms can manage them by staying hydrated, resting, and taking medication for pain relief. Antiviral medication may be prescribed for the flu, and COVID-19 therapeutics may be an option for those who meet the criteria. It is important to seek medical care if symptoms worsen or persist beyond three days, or if concerning symptoms such as a high fever or difficulty breathing develop. To prevent the spread of infection, individuals should practice good hand hygiene, cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, avoid groups of people, wear a mask, and maintain social distancing when necessary. The article also emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated for both COVID-19 and the flu, noting that individuals can receive both shots simultaneously. Finally, the article provides information on how patients can share their COVID-19 test results with their Mayo Clinic Health System care team through a patient portal questionnaire. Regarding forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the article does not provide specific data or models. However, the information on symptoms, testing, and management of COVID-19 cases can contribute to overall data collection and monitoring, which are crucial for forecasting hospitalizations and planning healthcare resources.

Title: WHO says Covid-19 remains a global health emergency, but pandemic is at a ‘transition point’
Publisher: CNN
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that COVID-19 remains a global health emergency, indicating that the pandemic is at a "transition point." The WHO's advisory committee has urged countries to continue taking measures to manage the emergency, including vaccinations, improved disease surveillance, and maintaining strong healthcare systems. The organization also acknowledges that COVID-19 will likely remain a permanent fixture in humans and animals, and that long-term public health action is necessary. In terms of forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations, the WHO's recommendations highlight the importance of population immunity through infection and/or vaccination in reducing the impact of the virus on morbidity and mortality. However, the organization warns that the virus will continue to surprise us and kill people unless health tools and misinformation are effectively addressed. Additionally, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has warned that all countries remain unprepared for future outbreaks, emphasizing the need for emergency preparedness and simultaneous hazard responses. The IFRC's reports highlight the importance of community-level action and addressing existing inequities to build resilience and improve outcomes during disasters, including disease outbreaks. While global COVID-19 deaths are trending upward, the seven-day average remains lower than previous pandemic peaks. The WHO and IFRC emphasize the need for continued vigilance and preparedness to mitigate the impact of the virus and future outbreaks.

Title: Statement on the fourteenth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Trusted: True
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a summary of the article: On January 27, 2023, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, held a meeting with the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee to discuss the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite improvements since the peak of Omicron a year prior, COVID-19 still poses a significant threat, with over 170,000 deaths globally in the last eight weeks. Surveillance and genetic sequencing have declined, hindering the ability to track and detect variants. Health systems are strained, dealing with COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, as well as staff shortages and fatigue. The WHO urged countries to remain vigilant, improve data reporting, and continue public health measures. The Emergency Committee acknowledged the progress made but expressed concerns about the ongoing risks, including insufficient vaccine uptake in lowand middle-income countries and the emergence of new variants. They emphasized the need for improved surveillance and reporting on hospitalizations to understand the impact on health systems better. The Committee agreed that COVID-19 remains a severe infectious disease and discussed the potential negative consequences of terminating the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) status. They recommended that WHO develop alternative mechanisms to maintain global focus on COVID-19 post-PHEIC and requested an assessment of regulatory implications for vaccine and treatment development if PHEIC termination occurs soon. Key facts to help forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations: The COVID-19 pandemic may be reaching an inflection point, with population immunity potentially limiting the impact of SARS-CoV-2. However, the virus will likely remain established in humans and animals, and long-term public health action is necessary. The decoupling of infection and severe disease with Omicron sub-lineages is observed, but the virus can still evolve unpredictably. Improved surveillance and reporting on hospitalizations and ICU admissions are needed to understand the current impact on health systems. Health system capacities developed during the pandemic should be maintained, and resilience should continue to be strengthened. Insufficient vaccine uptake in lowand middle-income countries and the highest-risk groups globally remains a concern. Long-term effects of post-COVID conditions, including cardiovascular and metabolic issues, will likely have serious ongoing impacts, and dedicated care pathways are limited or unavailable in many countries.

Title: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic
Publisher: Nature.com
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
The article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 studies on learning progress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies included in the review used measures of learning that could be standardized and based their estimates on empirical data collected since the pandemic's onset. The geographic reach of the evidence is limited, with most estimates coming from the United States and the UK, and a lack of studies from middleand low-income countries. The quality of the evidence is mixed, with potential sources of bias including confounding, sample selection, and missing data. However, there is no evidence of publication bias. The meta-analysis found that learning progress slowed substantially during the pandemic, with a pooled effect size of -0.14, suggesting that students lost out on about 35% of a school year's worth of learning. Learning deficits arose early in the pandemic and persist, with no evidence of recovery. Socio-economic inequality in education increased, with most estimates indicating a widening gap between children from different socio-economic backgrounds. Learning deficits were larger in maths than in reading, possibly due to greater dependence on formal instruction in maths. The review and meta-analysis provide valuable insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' learning progress. The findings suggest that the pandemic has had a significant negative effect on education, particularly for disadvantaged students. The persistence of learning deficits underscores the need for targeted interventions and support to help students catch up and reduce educational inequality.

Title: President Biden to end COVID-19 emergencies on May 11
Publisher: The Associated Press
Trusted: False
Posted: 5 days ago
President Joe Biden announced that he will end the national emergencies for addressing COVID-19 on May 11, 2023, signaling a shift in how the federal government responds to the virus. The national emergency and public health emergency declarations were first put in place in 2020 by then-President Donald Trump and have been extended by Biden since he took office in 2021. The end of these emergencies will mean that the federal government will treat COVID-19 as an endemic threat that can be managed by individual agencies. This move comes as lawmakers have already rolled back some elements of the emergencies, such as ending the rule that prevented states from removing people from Medicaid. It also comes as most federal COVID-19 relief money has been spent. The Biden administration's decision to end the emergencies was influenced by the fact that case counts have been trending downward and are significantly below levels seen in the last two winters. However, it is important to note that more than 1.1 million people in the US have died from COVID-19 since 2020, with about 3,700 deaths in the last week alone. Once the emergency expires, the cost of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to increase significantly, and people with private insurance may have to pay out-of-pocket costs for vaccines and tests. Hospitals will also not receive extra payments for treating COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) still considers the coronavirus a global health emergency, and the Biden administration has stated that ending the emergency declarations does not mean an end to all COVID-19 restrictions. They emphasize that it is important to continue monitoring the situation and take necessary precautions to protect public health.
