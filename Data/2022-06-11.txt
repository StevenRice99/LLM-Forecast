Title: Ontario should have extended masking for all high-risk settings, says new science table head
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 2 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
549 COVID-19 hospitalizations reported on Thursday (up from 522 on Wednesday and down from 670 last week)
42% of hospitalized patients were admitted specifically for the virus
118 ICU admissions required due to COVID-19 (up slightly from 114 on Tuesday)
64% of ICU patients were admitted because of the virus

Title: Ontario COVID adviser wanted masking extension, Moore says time to shift to guidance
Publisher: CTV News Toronto
Posted: 2 days ago
Hospitalizations and test positivity rates are declining.
Mask mandates on public transit and in most health settings will lift as scheduled on Saturday.
The provincial guidance that will replace the directives will advise continuing masking for hospital patients, visitors, and staff.
Some hospitals across the province said they would be keeping mask rules in place for visitors and staff due to vulnerable patient populations.
Long-term care and retirement homes will maintain mask mandates due to high-risk populations.

Title: Alberta hit by far more COVID deaths this year than in the same period in previous years
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 2 days ago
Key values:
Low 3rd dose uptake (38% of population) in Alberta
High death toll due to Omicron variant and BA.2 subvariant
Increased risk of severe illness among unvaccinated individuals and those with only two doses
Stubbornly high baseline for deaths and hospitalizations despite recent drop in daily COVID-related deaths

Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 3 days ago
522 COVID-19 hospitalizations reported on Wednesday (down from 526 on Tuesday and 722 last week)
41% of hospitalized patients were admitted specifically for the virus
114 ICU admissions required intensive care (same as Tuesday, down from 127 at this time last week)
54 ventilator patients require help to breathe
69% of ICU patients were admitted because of the virus

Title: Identifying spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 transmissions and the drivers of the patterns in Toronto: a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal modelling
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
This text describes a statistical analysis of COVID-19 incidence rates in Toronto neighborhoods using Bayesian hierarchical modeling and sensitivity analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Methodology 
1. Data: The study uses COVID-19 incidence data from Toronto neighborhoods over 89 weeks.
2. Modeling: Four Bayesian hierarchical models are developed to account for spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects on COVID-19 incidence rates.
3. MCMC chains: Two MCMC chains with 10,000 iterations each are used to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters.
Model selection 
1. DIC and pD values: The Deviance information criteria (DIC) and probability of direction (pD) values are used to evaluate the goodness of fit for the four models.
2. Best-fitted model: Model 3 is selected as the best-fitted model based on DIC and pD values.
Spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal relative risks 
1. Relative risk estimates: Spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal relative risk estimates are obtained from the outputs of Model 3.
2. Maps and plots: Maps and plots are created to visualize the posterior means of spatial relative risk, temporal relative risk with credible intervals, and spatiotemporal relative risk.
Joinpoint regression 
1. Temporal pattern analysis: Joinpoint regression is used to analyze the temporal pattern of COVID-19 incidence rates.
2. Significant changes in trend: The software identifies statistically significant (P = 0.05) changes in trend using a Monte Carlo Permutation method.
Spatiotemporal risk trend analysis 
1. Trend calculation: The spatiotemporal trend of relative risk over time is calculated for each neighborhood.
2. Maps and plots: Maps and plots are created to visualize the trends in relative risk over time.
Sensitivity analysis 
1. Alternate prior assumptions: Two additional models with alternate prior assumptions than the original final model (Model 3) are run to perform a sensitivity analysis.
2. Comparison of outputs: The outputs from these two models are compared to the outputs from the original model to ensure that findings are not sensitive to the original hyperprior specification.
Overall, this study uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling and sensitivity analysis to investigate the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects on COVID-19 incidence rates in Toronto neighborhoods.
