Long COVID is a broad spectrum of health issues that can arise following an acute COVID infection, with symptoms ranging from temporary changes in menstrual cycle to debilitating, persistent health impacts.
Early estimates suggested 10-40% of people could be affected by long COVID, but more recent data suggests lower rates, possibly around 1.3-0.2%.
Vaccination or prior COVID can reduce the risk of long COVID, but it's not a guarantee.
Long COVID has significant consequences for individuals and society, including impacts on quality of life, work capacity, and mental health.
The article emphasizes the need to acknowledge that COVID is not just a cold and has consequences, while also recognizing that basic precautions can reduce individual risk.
