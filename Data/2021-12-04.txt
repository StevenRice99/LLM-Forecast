The article discusses the COVID-19 vaccination efforts in Canada, specifically in Ontario and Quebec, for children aged five to eleven years old. Key points include:
Children born in 2016 and earlier are eligible for vaccination in Ontario.
The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine is recommended for people under 24 due to a mild risk of a rare heart condition associated with the Moderna Spikevax vaccine.
In Quebec, anyone five years old or older can get an appointment or visit a permanent or mobile walk-in clinic.
Clinics for newly eligible children will operate in schools, and siblings can be booked together in a single time slot.
Parents can check a box to signal if their child is nervous about the process.
COVID-19 symptoms can range from a cold-like illness to a severe lung infection, with common symptoms including fever, cough, headache, vomiting, and loss of taste or smell.
Long-haul symptoms can last for months.
If you have severe symptoms, call 911.
Mental health can also be affected by the pandemic, and resources are available to help.
In eastern Ontario, select pharmacies test people with symptoms, along with certain people without symptoms. Rapid and take-home tests are available in some places, including pharmacies and child-care settings when risk is high.
Travellers who need a test have local options to pay for one.
In western Quebec, tests are strongly recommended for people with symptoms and their contacts.
People can make an appointment or see if they're near a walk-in option online. They can also call 1-877-644-4545 with questions during hours the line is running.
Gargle tests are offered in some places instead of a swab.
Rapid COVID-19 tests are available in all Quebec preschools and elementary schools.
First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people, or someone travelling to work in a remote Indigenous community, are eligible for a test in Ontario.
