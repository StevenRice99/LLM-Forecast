The Regeneron antibody cocktail has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization rates.
However, its limited availability in Canada (6,000 doses received) may impact its potential use.
Logistical challenges, such as the need for intravenous infusion and dedicated healthcare personnel, have hindered widespread adoption in Canada.
Experts suggest that new delivery methods (e.g., subcutaneous administration) could help overcome these barriers.

Title: External validation of the 4C mortality score among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective study
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 5 days ago
The study used data from the McMaster Multi-Regional Hospital Coronavirus Registry (COREG) in southern Ontario, Canada.
The registry includes COVID-19-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions from six tertiary hospitals with approximately 2400 total inpatient beds.
The study analyzed patients admitted between March 2020 and June 2021, stratified into three waves based on admission date.
The 4C mortality score was adapted to match available data and used to predict in-hospital mortality.
The study found good discriminability of the 4C score (AUC = 0.77) and calculated diagnostic accuracy measures for different cut-offs.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Number of inpatient beds (approximately 2400)
Admission date stratification into three waves
Adapted 4C mortality score to predict in-hospital mortality

Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Recent studies show a drop in effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines, but protection against severe disease remains high.
A pre-print study by Public Health England suggests that protection against hospitalization and death remains much higher than protection against infection, even among older adults.
In Ontario, there were 43 hospitalized breakthrough cases among the fully vaccinated on Friday, compared with 256 unvaccinated hospitalized infections.
The concept of waning immunity depends on whether you're measuring protection against infection or against severe disease.
