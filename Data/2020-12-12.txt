According to the article, there are five COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada:
1. Pfizer-BioNTech
2. Moderna
3. Oxford-AstraZeneca (currently not being used for first and second doses due to concerns about a rare form of blood clotting)
4. Nuvaxovid (the first protein-based vaccine approved in Canada)
5. Johnson & Johnson (requires only one injection)
Additionally, there are two other COVID-19 vaccines in development that have been prepurchased by the Canadian government:
1. Medicago/GlaxoSmithKline
2. Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline
It's worth noting that the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines may follow a similar pattern to previous vaccine distributions, but with the federal government playing a more active role in the initial stages due to logistical challenges associated with vaccines that require cold or ultracold infrastructure.

Here's a summary of the article:
Canada Approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 
Canada has become the third country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use.
The vaccine will be distributed to 14 medical facilities across the country where ultra-cold freezers are already in place, minimizing wastage from transportation.
Canadians living in remote areas, such as the territories, may have to wait until the Moderna vaccine is approved before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
Global Context 
Bahrain and the UK were the first two countries to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The US FDA is set to give the vaccine the green light this week.
Canada's approval process was expedited due to an emergency order, allowing Health Canada to review rolling information from the pharmaceutical company.
Regulatory Process 
Health Canada began its regulatory review of the Pfizer vaccine in October and has been assessing rolling information since then.
The agency will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will take action if any safety concerns are identified.
Pfizer has agreed to follow clinical trial participants for two years after their second dose and will release a full risk management plan by March 31.
National Response 
Plans are being made for each province and territory to track who receives doses, with the federal government considering an additional layer of national monitoring.
COVID-19 vaccines will be offered to Canadians free of charge and will not be mandatory.
Health Canada has signed contracts guaranteeing access to 414 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines.
Overall, this is a significant development in Canada's response to the pandemic, with the approval of a second vaccine candidate providing more options for Canadians.

Title: With COVID-19 'spreading aggressively,' Toronto and Peel face uncertain future after lockdown
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 4 days ago
Key values:
Case counts and hospitalizations in Toronto and Peel Region have continued their steady climb over the past two weeks.
The number of COVID-19 patients in ICUs across Ontario reached a second-wave high of 213 on Monday.
Dr. Michael Warner expects COVID-19 ICU admissions to continue surging until at least the end of the year, putting massive strain on the health-care system and its workers.
The onset of COVID-19 symptoms can take up to 14 days after a person's initial infection, meaning that case numbers collected this week by Toronto and Peel Region could offer the most accurate measure yet of the lockdown's effectiveness.

Title: Unclear wording of CERB eligibility means some recipients asked to pay everything back
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses a situation where some self-employed Canadians who received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) are being asked to repay the funds because their net income was below the $5,000 threshold, despite their gross income exceeding that amount. The individuals affected by this change include:
1. A tattoo business owner in St. Catharines, Ontario, who received a letter from the CRA asking her to repay $14,000.
2. Three clients of an accountant in Wilmont, Ontario, who also received similar letters.
The issue arises because the CERB application form does not explicitly mention net income, but rather asks for gross income. However, tax experts point out that the CRA's website does mention net pre-tax income as a consideration for business owners applying for CERB.
Tax expert Jamie Golombek suggests that the government should have been clearer in their communications to avoid these misunderstandings. He also notes that people who received letters requesting repayment will likely be expected to follow through and pay back the funds.
The article highlights the complexities of tax laws and the potential consequences for self-employed individuals who may not fully understand the rules. It also raises questions about the fairness of asking people to repay CERB funds when they were initially approved based on their gross income, which was higher than the $5,000 threshold.
