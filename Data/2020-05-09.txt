Title: Why some nursing homes won't let families install 'granny cams' to check on their loved ones

The article discusses the use of "granny cams" in long-term care homes, which are cameras installed by family members to monitor their loved ones' care and safety. While some care homes permit the use of these cameras, others have raised concerns about audio recording, citing laws that prohibit recording private conversations without consent.
However, an Ottawa lawyer, Daniel Nassrallah, argues that the law does not apply in residents' rooms, as staff do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when they are in a resident's room. He advises his clients to install cameras with audio functionality and suggests that homes can put up signs indicating that there is recording taking place.
Nassrallah also cites a Quebec regulation and case law from 2017 that establish the resident's room as their home and their power of attorney's right to install audio/video recording devices. The Supreme Court of Canada has rejected an appeal challenging this ruling, which Nassrallah sees as persuasive common law in Ontario.
The article also quotes Miranda Ferrier, president of the Ontario Personal Support Workers' Association, who supports the use of cameras and suggests that homes should be accommodating during the COVID-19 pandemic. She proposes making an exception to allow two-way audio communication between residents and their families.
Overall, the article highlights the complexities surrounding the use of granny cams in long-term care homes and the need for clarity on this issue.
