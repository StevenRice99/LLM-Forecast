Title: What is a 'circuit breaker' lockdown, and should Canada consider one?
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 3 days ago
Key points:
A short lockdown (18-20 days) can help reduce cases and ease pressure on contact tracers.
The goal is not to eradicate transmission but to pause it to allow cases to drop.
Clear messaging and discipline are crucial for the success of a short lockdown.
Testing rates have not increased in Ontario, which may lead to more severe lockdowns.
A severe lockdown (excluding grocery stores, drug stores, hospitals, and public safety services) might be necessary if testing is not deployed proactively.
