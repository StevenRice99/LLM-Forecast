Title: More money is a must, but health-care delivery also needs a major rethink, doctors say
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses Canada's health-care system and the challenges it faces in providing quality care to its citizens. The federal government has been transferring funds to the provinces to cover healthcare costs, but experts say that more money is needed to address the system's problems.
Some of the key issues mentioned include:
1. Shortage of doctors and nurses: Canada is facing a shortage of medical professionals, which puts pressure on the existing workforce.
2. Administrative burden: Doctors and administrators are spending too much time on administrative tasks, taking away from patient care.
3. Need for system reforms: Experts say that the health-care system needs to be reformed to improve outcomes, including investing in community care, palliative care, home care, and digital integration.
To address these issues, experts suggest:
1. Long-term, predictable funding: The federal government should provide long-term funding commitments to provinces to allow for sustainable planning.
2. Streamlining health information sharing: Improving the sharing of health information between different healthcare providers can reduce administrative burdens on doctors and nurses.
3. Recognizing foreign credentials: Quickly recognizing the foreign credentials of doctors and nurses already living in Canada could boost their numbers without poaching health-care workers from abroad.
4. Changing how health care is delivered: More health services should be delivered outside of a hospital setting, requiring additional family doctors with lower administrative burdens.
The article concludes that solving Canada's health-care crisis requires more than just money; it demands a new way of doing things.
