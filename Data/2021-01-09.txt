Title: Inmates fear 'leaving in a body bag' as COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons worsen
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 5 days ago
The article discusses the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Canada's prison system, highlighting concerns about the safety of inmates and staff due to inadequate measures taken by Correctional Service Canada (CSC). The story focuses on a specific individual, Whalen, who was sentenced for a parole violation related to narcotics use in 2017. Despite his efforts to turn his life around, he is now worried that the pandemic might prevent him from returning to his life and resuming his progress.
Advocates, including criminology professor Justin Piché and Toronto Prisoners' Rights Project organizer Hoilett, criticize CSC for not taking sufficient preventative measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within prisons. They point out that:
1. The number of reported cases among inmates has increased significantly since mid-March 2020.
2. Provincial institutions have reduced their populations by a quarter between February and April, while federal institutions only decreased by one percent during the same period.
3. CSC did not seriously consider releasing non-violent inmates over 50 years old, despite this age group being disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
Piché emphasizes that preventative actions were missed, and now it's too late to undo the damage. He suggests that:
1. The federal government should immediately release people who can be safely released.
2. Money should be allocated for temporary and permanent housing for former inmates and needy civilians.
The article highlights the need for CSC to take more proactive measures to protect the health and safety of both inmates and staff, as well as the broader community.
