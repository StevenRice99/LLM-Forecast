Title: Paxlovid Reduced Hospitalizations, Deaths During Omicron
Publisher: Medscape

The study found that nirmatrelvir–ritonavir (Paxlovid) reduced the risk of hospital admission or death among patients with COVID-19 by 44% (weighted OR: 0.56).
The number needed to treat (NNT) was 62, meaning that for every 62 people treated with Paxlovid, one case of severe COVID-19 was prevented.
The effectiveness of Paxlovid may change over time due to differences in patient populations, underlying immunity, and circulating variants.
Older age remains the single most important risk factor for severe COVID-19, followed by obesity, underlying conditions, and time since vaccination.

Title: Paxlovid still offers high-risk COVID-19 patients protection against hospital admissions, study says
Publisher: The Globe and Mail

The study used Ontario health data to compare patients who received Paxlovid with those who did not.
2.1% of patients who got Paxlovid ended up in the hospital or died, compared to 3.7% of those who did not get it.
The number needed to treat (NNT) is 62, meaning 62 patients would need to be treated with Paxlovid to prevent one hospitalization or death.
Paxlovid is most effective at preventing severe outcomes in people at the highest risk, such as those 70 and older or with underlying medical conditions.

Publisher: Global News
Posted: 5 days ago
The study looked at data from 8,876 patients who took Paxlovid and compared their outcomes to 168,669 Ontarians who did not receive the drug.
Patients over age 70, with comorbidities or under-vaccinated, had significantly reduced odds of hospital admission and death from COVID-19 after receiving Paxlovid.
For every 62 people treated with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir (Paxlovid), the medication prevented one case of severe COVID-19.

90% in unvaccinated individuals
These results are relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
