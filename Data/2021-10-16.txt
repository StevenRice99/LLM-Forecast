The Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine was 85-98% effective against severe infection and 80-95% effective against symptomatic infection.
The SpikeVax (Moderna) vaccine was 90-96% effective against severe infection and 87-100% effective against symptomatic infection.
Both vaccines showed reduced efficacy in the elderly, long-term care residents, immunocompromised individuals, and against Beta and Delta variants.
Vaccine effectiveness waned over time, with a significant drop after six months (67-53% effective against non-Delta and Delta infections).
Booster doses are recommended for vulnerable populations to maintain protection.

Title: New data suggests Canada's 'gamble' on delaying, mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines paid off
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 6 days ago
The article discusses the effectiveness of delaying second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, specifically the Pfizer vaccine. Research in Canada has shown that spreading out the first and second shots leads to stronger protection against severe COVID-19 infection.
According to Dr. De Serres, the Quebec Immunization Committee is considering whether additional doses may be needed for certain groups, but it's not a pressing issue given the strong protection from hospitalization. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and the Quebec Immunization Committee are monitoring the situation.
Experts agree that while countries have reported waning immunity against COVID-19 infection, the vaccines still provide prolonged protection against severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death. They emphasize that the goal is to prevent serious outcomes, not every case of COVID-19.
The article also mentions that Canada's Chief Science Adviser, Mona Nemer, had expressed concerns about the strategy of delaying second doses in March, calling it a "population level experiment." However, experts now say that the gamble paid off, and the results are encouraging.
Immunologist Deepta Bhattacharya notes that the Canadian data provides real-world evidence that vaccinated people produce more antibodies if their second shot is delayed. He suggests that this may have implications for future vaccine recommendations in other countries.
The article concludes by emphasizing that while COVID-19 will likely become a long-term issue, the vaccines can still provide strong protection against severe outcomes. Experts recommend continuing to follow public health measures and being vigilant about potential future needs for boosters.
