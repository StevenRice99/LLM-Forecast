Title: Canada’s hospital capacity crisis will remain long after the pandemic is over
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Posted: Today
The article discusses the potential for bundled payments in Canadian healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Bundled payments involve paying hospitals a fixed amount for a specific treatment or procedure, rather than reimbursing them on a fee-for-service basis.
Kevin Smith, president of the University Health Network in Toronto, has implemented small-scale versions of bundled payments at UHN and St. Joseph Health System in Hamilton. He notes that this approach incentivizes better care by tying hospital budgets to patient outcomes.
Jason Sutherland, an expert on healthcare funding, advocates for a funding model that ties hospital budgets to patient outcomes. He suggests that hospitals should be rewarded for providing high-quality care, rather than simply being paid for the number of procedures they perform.
The article also highlights the importance of data in improving healthcare outcomes. Elyse Berger Pelletier, an ER physician and former deputy director general of emergencies and EMS in Quebec, notes that leveraging data can help identify areas where hospitals are overusing resources, such as keeping patients in hospital longer than necessary.
Pelletier suggests that Canadian hospitals could learn from their US counterparts, which have more robust data systems to track patient outcomes. She argues that this approach could help free up capacity in the short term and improve patient care.
The article concludes by noting that some Canadian jurisdictions are better at leveraging data than others, but that there is still much work to be done to improve healthcare outcomes.
Key points:
Bundled payments can incentivize better care by tying hospital budgets to patient outcomes.
Data is essential for improving healthcare outcomes and identifying areas where hospitals can optimize their resources.
Canadian hospitals could learn from their US counterparts in terms of data-driven decision-making.
Leveraging data can help free up capacity in the short term and improve patient care.
Overall, the article suggests that a more data-driven approach to healthcare funding and resource allocation could lead to better patient outcomes and improved efficiency in Canadian hospitals.

Title: COVID-19 on P.E.I.: What's happening the week of March 27
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
13 people were being treated at hospitals for COVID-19 as of Tuesday (no specific mention of Ontario).
An average of 350 new cases per day over the seven days prior to Tuesday.
The impact of COVID-19 on the health-care system will be key in determining if restrictions will be lifted further, says Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison (no specific mention of Ontario).
Paxlovid is helping keep Islanders out of hospital, says Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison (Paxlovid availability and effectiveness may vary by province).
Note: The article primarily focuses on Prince Edward Island (PEI), but some general information about COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Atlantic Canada might be indirectly relevant for forecasting in Ontario, Canada.

Title: COVID vs. flu — is it a fair comparison?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 2 days ago
Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist from Ontario, warns that treating COVID-19 like a flu is a "dangerous thing" due to its potential long-term damage and serious effects.
COVID-19 has caused significant hospitalizations (nearly 150 people hospitalized with COVID in New Brunswick) compared to the flu (no hospitalizations reported in Week 10 of the current flu season).
Furness suggests that scaling back testing and monitoring for COVID-19 can lead to a false sense of security, encouraging more spread and potentially harming vulnerable populations.
He emphasizes the importance of continued vigilance and accurate reporting to inform public health decisions and protect vulnerable individuals.

Title: Canada headed towards 6th COVID-19 wave this spring, experts warn - National
Publisher: Global News
Posted: 4 days ago
Cases and hospitalizations are creeping back up again across the country.
Ontario reported 790 people were in hospital with COVID-19 (a 20-per cent increase from Monday) and 165 were in intensive care Tuesday.
The more contagious BA.2 subvariant of Omicron is driving the increase, coupled with loosened public health measures.
Experts anticipate that the spring wave will cause cases to rise, with a risk of an increase in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths.
Protection from a third COVID-19 booster shot may be declining three to four months after the third dose, potentially resulting in more severe cases in older people.

Title: Is COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy safe?
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Posted: 4 days ago
97,590 pregnant individuals from Ontario were studied
23% (22,660) received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy
No significant association was found between COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and:
+ Postpartum hemorrhage
+ Chorioamnionitis
+ Cesarean delivery
+ NICU admissions
+ Low Apgar score
The study's findings remained unchanged when stratified by vaccine manufacturer, number of doses received, or trimester of vaccination.

Exponential rise in COVID-19 wastewater viral signal in Ottawa since March 10
Daily viral signal detected on March 24 similar to daily levels detected in mid-January
Hospitalization levels in the city have been relatively steady, but hospitalizations often lag by about a week or more behind a rise in infections
Current hospitalization numbers: 10 residents in hospital because of an active case of COVID-19 (OPH), with 25 patients at The Ottawa Hospital and 12 patients at Queensway Carleton Hospital.
