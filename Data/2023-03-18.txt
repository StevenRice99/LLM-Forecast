Title: Why Canada avoided a severe winter COVID wave
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: Today
The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 immunity in Canada and globally, highlighting the concept of hybrid immunity, which is a combination of vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity from previous infections.
Key points:
Hybrid immunity provides sustained protection against severe disease but not as good protection against infection.
Protection against infection wanes more quickly, leading to continued waves of transmission despite high levels of immunity.
The safest way to get immunity is through vaccination, with a much lower risk of severe illness compared to previous variants like Delta or the original strain.
South Africa has seen a significant reduction in hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 since the rollout of vaccines, with the current immunity wall holding well.
Better access to antiviral treatments has helped reduce hospitalizations, especially among elderly Canadians who are less likely to have prior infections.
The immunity landscape is drastically different between younger adults and elderly Canadians, with a larger proportion of younger people having been infected.
Future goals should focus on improving COVID-19 vaccine technology to recreate the protection provided by hybrid immunity in those who haven't yet been vaccinated.
The article also mentions that:
Immunity from severe disease may wane over time, and it's unclear how long immunity will last.
There could be seasonal variation in terms of the severity of COVID infections, similar to the flu.
The scientists tracking new COVID-19 variants are on high alert for potential new strains that could emerge before they're detected and tracked.
Overall, the article suggests that while there is still some uncertainty about the long-term effectiveness of hybrid immunity, it has provided a significant level of protection against severe disease, and continued vigilance and research are necessary to address any future challenges.

Title: Daughter can't understand why dad couldn't get Paxlovid to ease COVID symptoms
Publisher: Times Colonist
Posted: Today
Key values:
Age 60 and older are eligible for Paxlovid in Ontario
Those 18 and older with immuno-compromised conditions or high risk of severe illness due to other serious diseases (e.g. liver, lung, kidney disease) are also eligible
The article mentions the effectiveness of Paxlovid in reducing hospitalization and death in high-risk patients, but notes that there is no significant reduction in hospitalization or death in lower-risk populations

Title: Ontario declared a state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic three years ago today. Here is a look back.
Publisher: CP24
Posted: 1 day ago
Key points:
Older Canadians (over 60) and those with underlying medical conditions are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.
Vaccination rates have been high, but breakthrough cases can still occur.
The virus has reached a relatively steady state in the country, but certain groups remain at higher risk.
Continued vaccination is recommended to protect against severe illness.

Title: Over 14,000 Canadians Died While Waiting for Medical Treatment From 2021-2022: Report
Publisher: Vision Times
Posted: 3 days ago
Relevant.
Summary: Ontario will face a shortage of 33,000 nurses and personal support workers by 2027-28, with current salaries being the lowest in Canada. This could impact healthcare capacity, including COVID-19 hospitalizations, as hospitals may struggle to maintain adequate staffing levels.

Article 5 of 9
Title: Canadian cardiologists debunk Florida COVID-19 vaccine claims
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses a letter written by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo claiming a significant surge in VAERS reports related to COVID-19 vaccinations, which was condemned as potentially harmful misinformation by US health agencies.
The article highlights concerns among Canadian health professionals about the claims made and the quality of evidence cited.
Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
+ Vaccination rates: The article does not provide specific vaccination rates for Ontario or Canada, but notes that over 13 billion doses have been given worldwide with low rates of adverse effects.
+ Hospitalization data: There is no mention of hospitalization data specifically related to COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada.
+ Demographic factors: The article does not discuss demographic factors such as age, sex, or comorbidities that may be relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Children infected with Omicron more likely to have repeat ER visits: Canadian study
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 5 days ago
Children infected with Omicron were more likely to have additional emergency department visits compared to those infected with Delta.
There was no clear difference in the proportion of children hospitalized or admitted to the intensive care unit across different variants.
Fever and cough were associated more heavily with Omicron and Delta variants, but serious outcomes like hospitalization remained stable even across all variants.

Title: Comorbidity-stratified estimates of 30-day mortality risk by age for unvaccinated men and women with COVID-19: a population-based cohort study - BMC Public Health
Publisher: BMC Public Health
Posted: 5 days ago
Age remains a key factor in triage process
Presence of comorbidities (e.g., CKD, cancer) increases mortality risk, especially among men and those under 45 years old
Frailty indicator can be used to identify individuals at higher risk for death with COVID-19 despite younger age
Relative age (e.g., "heart age") can improve communication of cardiovascular risk and promote behavior change.

Title: After 3 years of COVID-19, here’s how Canada’s ‘endemic’ future may look - National
Publisher: Global News
Posted: 7 days ago
COVID-19 hospitalizations have been relatively stable over the past 6-8 months despite the ongoing spread of Omicron subvariants.
Experts expect a steady state of COVID-19 activity in Canada with no distinct variant-driven waves.
The population has immunity to COVID-19, and death rates are lower since the beginning of the pandemic.
Future challenges may arise for older and immune-compromised Canadians, but the impact may not be as profound as it was in 2020 or 2021.

Title: Three years later: What has COVID-19 taught us and are we ready for the next big threat?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 7 days ago
This article discusses the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada, and how they can be applied to future public health crises. The author interviews various experts, including Dr. Tim Caulfield, a professor of bioethics at the University of Alberta, and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's former chief medical officer of health.
The article highlights several key takeaways from the pandemic:
1. Science evolves: The pandemic showed that scientific knowledge can change rapidly, and public health officials must be prepared to adapt their recommendations accordingly.
2. Trust is a two-way street: The government and public health officials must communicate clearly and transparently with the public, while also acknowledging and addressing concerns and mistrust.
3. Socio-economic divisions were amplified: The pandemic highlighted existing socio-economic divisions in society, with more advantaged people being more willing to trust Canadian institutions.
4. Vaccine uptake was high: Despite some resistance, a significant majority of Albertans (78%) received their initial COVID-19 shots.
The article also discusses the challenges that may arise if another pandemic occurs:
1. Distrust and polarization: The experience of the past three years has created distrust among some segments of society, which could make it more difficult to implement public health measures in the future.
2. Lessons not learned: Some experts worry that the lessons from the pandemic will not be applied, leading to a repeat of mistakes made during COVID-19.
The article concludes by highlighting the importance of learning from past experiences and being prepared for future public health crises:
1. Hope for change: Despite the challenges, there is hope for positive change, as people have learned how to negotiate with each other and extend their relationships.
2. Preparedness is key: The next time a pandemic occurs, it's essential to be better prepared, with clear communication, trust-building, and proactive measures in place.
Overall, the article provides a nuanced and thought-provoking analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, highlighting both the successes and challenges that arose during this period.
