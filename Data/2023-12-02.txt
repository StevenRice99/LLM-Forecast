The article discusses the expected respiratory season this winter, with experts predicting a mix of COVID-19, flu, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, RSV, adenovirus, and seasonal coronavirus. However, there are some uncertainties and potential threats, including:
A possible surge in cases of mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacteria that can cause lung infection.
The emergence of a new strain of swine flu in the UK, which illustrates the unpredictability of respiratory pathogens.
COVID-19 remaining a major force this season, with experts expecting it to continue to impact hospitalizations and death numbers.
The article also highlights the potential for variant "Pirola" (BA.2.86) and its descendants to contribute to an anticipated winter surge in COVID-19 cases. This variant is already responsible for around 9% of COVID cases in the US, and experts expect it to continue to grow.
Experts are considering several theories to explain the wonky post-pandemic viral seasons, including:
Immunity debt: the idea that people have built up immunity to certain viruses during the pandemic, but this immunity is now waning.
Suppression of the immune system by COVID-19, making people more susceptible to other infections.
Co-infection with multiple pathogens at the same time, which can make one or both of them more severe.
Viral interference: the idea that competitive viruses like COVID-19 "cancel out" other viruses for a period of time.
Overall, experts are cautioning that this winter's respiratory season is likely to be unpredictable and potentially challenging, with COVID-19 remaining a major threat.

Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Wastewater data shows COVID-19 signal at its highest point in over a year (1.9), with GTA's signal at its highest since Jan 6, 2022.
Positivity rate of PCR tests is near 20% (21,000 tests completed last week).
Total number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from 3,894 to 4,369 in the last seven days, with 248 admissions in Ontario.
Peak expected as we enter winter months, according to Dr. Isaac Bogoch.
Senior population (over 70 years old) remains most disproportionately affected and at risk for hospitalization and death.
