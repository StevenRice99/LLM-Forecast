Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
Key values for forecasting:
Increased risk of hospitalizations and ICU admissions among younger adults (40-75 years old) due to variants of concern
54% of cases are now variants of the coronavirus
ICU admissions are ticking upward again after a mid-January high of over 400 COVID-19 patients in Ontario critical care units
Potential for overwhelming the health-care system with a domino effect impacting non-COVID-related appointments and procedures

Title: Physician calls for dialysis patients to be moved to front of vaccine queue
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
1.5% of patients undergoing dialysis contracted COVID-19 between March and August 2020.
60% of those who contracted COVID-19 ended up in hospital.
30% of those who contracted COVID-19 died from the illness.
Approximately 750 people are undergoing hemodialysis in the greater Ottawa area.

Title: Doctors say getting COVID-19 poses much bigger risk of blood clots
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 1 day ago
Blood clots from COVID-19 are more common than from the vaccine (incidence: 1 in 20 hospitalized with COVID-19 vs 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 500,000 vaccinated).
Vaccination can reduce hospitalization due to COVID-19 by 80% and death by 85% in people over 80.
A single dose of vaccine reduces symptomatic COVID-19 infections by 60% in people over 70.

Article 5 of 8
Title: Mobile On-Site COVID-19 Vaccination of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities by Neighbourhood Risk in Toronto
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 3 days ago
The text discusses a strategy for vaccinating older adults living in high-density residential buildings (NORCs) against COVID-19. The approach involves mobile on-site vaccination teams that can reach residents in their homes, rather than requiring them to travel to a clinic or hospital.
Key points from the text include:
1. Practical considerations: Providing mobile on-site vaccination to NORCs requires outreach efforts to facility management and residents, as well as a supply of COVID-19 vaccines with less stringent cold chain requirements.
2. Infrastructure limitations: NORCs may have physical infrastructure limitations such as slow or broken elevators, which can make it difficult to set up an on-site clinic.
3. Door-to-door vaccination: Door-to-door vaccination should be considered, especially if the building has limited common areas where a clinic could be set up.
4. Collaboration with healthcare providers: Collaboration with community paramedics or other healthcare providers who are familiar with NORC environments can be beneficial.
5. Coordination and division of labor: Mobile on-site vaccination teams should be coordinated and divided into smaller units responsible for different floors, with each unit consisting of vaccinators and volunteers/staff who greet residents, confirm informed consent, vaccinate, collect data, and monitor for adverse reactions.
6. Minimizing barriers to vaccine uptake: Teams should be aware of potential barriers to vaccine uptake, such as language barriers, and take steps to minimize them.
7. Vaccinating the entire building: When vaccinating a NORC, particularly in a high-risk community, the entire building should be considered for vaccination, not just older adults.
The text also highlights the potential benefits of this approach beyond COVID-19, including:
1. Rethinking aging services: The approach to vaccinating NORCs could provide a roadmap for re-designing services to support aging in place.
2. Aging in place: Optimizing NORCs can enable older adults to age in their own homes with choice and dignity.
The methods used to identify NORCs include:
1. Retrieving age distribution data: Retrieving the age distribution for all residents within each of Toronto's 44,935 postal codes from the Registered Persons Database.
2. Identifying high-density buildings: Identifying postal codes with at least 30% of their residents being 65 years or older and at least 50 older persons per postal code.
3. Geocoding and mapping: Geocoding each building to assign longitude and latitude, and mapping using Tableau software.

Title: COVID-19 might have been in Canada earlier than when it was first identified: expert
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
Key values:
Early warning systems can help officials assess action needed (Julianne Piper)
Timing matters when bringing in border measures to curb transmission (Piper)
Countries with tight border restrictions early on were more successful at controlling the virus (New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia)
Domestic measures combined with stopping the virus at the gates would have helped slow or prevent spread (Piper)

Title: A new COVID-19 side effect? Some patients are developing sudden onset diabetes
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
Up to 14% of COVID-19 patients may develop sudden onset diabetes.
People with diabetes are already more at risk of experiencing severe outcomes if they contract COVID-19.
The connection between COVID-19 and diabetes development is described as "a bidirectional relationship".
Researchers are investigating the possible causes, including steroid medications used to treat COVID-19 and the virus's direct effect on the pancreas.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 'ready-made' for human transmission, study suggests
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses how SARS-CoV-2 evolved before the first reported human case, making initial transmission from bats to humans easy. Key points for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 
- The virus's transmissibility was high from the outset.
- Significant genomic changes occurred before the jump to humans.
- Human-to-human transmission led to recent changes and variants (e.g., B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1).
- Variants evade antibodies and immunities, making vaccination crucial.
