Title: Ontario proposes letting pharmacists prescribe flu meds, give RSV vaccines
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 2 days ago
The 2022-23 fall and winter season saw higher than usual hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths due to increased infections of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19.
A similar surge is expected this year, with cases of COVID, RSV, and the flu expected to rise as community-based public health measures have relaxed.
The province's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, expects a similar surge in hospitalizations due to COVID-19, RSV, and influenza.
Major pediatric hospitals saw historic volumes in 2022 from October to December, with ICUs and emergency departments overflowing.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Historical data on hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths during the 2022-23 fall and winter season
Expected increase in cases of COVID, RSV, and influenza due to relaxed public health measures
Surge in hospitalizations expected this year, similar to last year's experience.

There are rising COVID-19 hospitalizations across Canada, including in British Columbia.
The percentage of positive COVID-19 tests is increasing (17.9% as of Sept 7).
Enhanced measures are being implemented at some facilities without public declaration of an outbreak.
The B.C. health ministry is updating viral respiratory illness outbreak guidance for this year.
A fall vaccine campaign will be rolled out in the next 10 days, prioritizing vulnerable populations and targeting the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant.
Some hospitals in Ontario have tightened their mask rules in response to rising COVID-19 cases.

The updated Moderna vaccine targets the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant and can be given to anyone 6 months or older.
Health Canada recommends testing for COVID-19 if you feel sick, especially if you have high-risk conditions.
People who test positive should self-isolate and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.
The article does not provide specific data on hospitalization rates in Ontario, but it provides general information on vaccination and testing strategies that can be used to inform forecasting models.

Title: A comparative study of compartmental models for COVID-19 transmission in Ontario, Canada
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 4 days ago
It appears that you've provided a detailed explanation of a research methodology using Stan and R for modeling COVID-19 case counts in Ontario, Canada. I'll summarize the key points:
Modeling Approach 
1. The study uses compartmental models (NLS and MCMC) to estimate daily case counts.
2. The posterior distribution of model estimates is approximated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples.
Posterior Distribution Approximation 
1. Eq. (7) describes the approximation of the posterior distribution using MCMC samples.
2. The posterior mean is used as the model-fitted daily case counts.
3. Credible intervals are obtained by taking the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the posterior distribution.
Modeling Challenges 
1. The study period is divided into several reopening phases, which can lead to jumps in estimated case counts due to changes in social behavior.
2. Locally weighted linear regression (LOESS) is used to smooth fitted daily case counts and credible boundaries.
Initial Conditions 
1. The total population size is set to 14,051,980 based on the Canadian census.
2. Initial conditions for compartments are estimated using confirmed COVID-19 cases in early January.
Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points or provide further assistance!

Summary: COVID-19 hospitalizations have been rising in Ontario, Canada since late summer, but not as much as last year. Protection wanes over time, and new variants can dodge prior immunity. The article does not provide specific data on hospitalization rates or trends in Ontario, but mentions that vaccination remains critical to public health and continued protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.
