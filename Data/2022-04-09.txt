Article 7 of 7
Title: Canada’s hospital capacity crisis will remain long after the pandemic is over
Publisher: The Globe and Mail

The article discusses the potential for bundled payments in Canadian healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Bundled payments involve paying hospitals a fixed amount for a specific treatment or procedure, rather than reimbursing them on a fee-for-service basis.
Kevin Smith, president of the University Health Network in Toronto, has implemented small-scale versions of bundled payments at UHN and St. Joseph Health System in Hamilton. He notes that this approach incentivizes better care by tying hospital budgets to patient outcomes.
Jason Sutherland, an expert on healthcare funding, advocates for a funding model that ties hospital budgets to patient outcomes. He suggests that hospitals should be rewarded for providing high-quality care, rather than simply being paid for the number of procedures they perform.
The article also highlights the importance of data in improving healthcare outcomes. Elyse Berger Pelletier, an ER physician and former deputy director general of emergencies and EMS in Quebec, notes that leveraging data can help identify areas where hospitals are overusing resources, such as keeping patients in hospital longer than necessary.
Pelletier suggests that Canadian hospitals could learn from their US counterparts, which have more robust data systems to track patient outcomes. She argues that this approach could help free up capacity in the short term and improve patient care.
The article concludes by noting that some Canadian jurisdictions are better at leveraging data than others, but that there is still much work to be done to improve healthcare outcomes.
Key points:
Bundled payments can incentivize better care by tying hospital budgets to patient outcomes.
Data is essential for improving healthcare outcomes and identifying areas where hospitals can optimize their resources.
Canadian hospitals could learn from their US counterparts in terms of data-driven decision-making.
Leveraging data can help free up capacity in the short term and improve patient care.
Overall, the article suggests that a more data-driven approach to healthcare funding and resource allocation could lead to better patient outcomes and improved efficiency in Canadian hospitals.
