Title: With eating disorders on the rise in Canada, experts break down common myths
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: Today
This article addresses four common myths about eating disorders (EDs) and provides accurate information and resources to help dispel these misconceptions. Here are the key points:
Myth 1: EDs only affect people who are overweight or obese 
The health-care system often focuses on weight loss, which can lead to body image concerns for individuals with larger body sizes.
EDs can occur in anyone, regardless of their weight or appearance.
Myth 2: You have to look a certain way to have an ED 
People with EDs may not appear underweight or unhealthy, but still exhibit symptoms such as restrictive eating and excessive exercise.
Health professionals should focus on the individual's behavior and attitudes towards food and body image, rather than their physical appearance.
Myth 3: Social media is the main cause of EDs 
While social media can contribute to body dissatisfaction and trigger EDs in some individuals, it is not the sole cause.
Research suggests that genetics (heritability) plays a significant role in the development of EDs, with environmental factors such as comments from loved ones or exposure to dieting industry marketing also contributing.
Myth 4: EDs only affect women 
Men can also develop EDs, which can manifest differently than in women.
Boys and men may experience more severe physical symptoms, such as headaches, cold skin, hair loss, and fatigue, but still require treatment and support.
The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of accurate information and resources for individuals affected by EDs. It provides a list of hotlines and resources dedicated to supporting people with eating disorders, including:
National Eating Disorder Information Centre (1-866-633-4220)
Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868 or http://www.kidshelpphone.ca)
Canada Suicide Prevention Helpline (1-833-456-4566 or 1-866-277-3553 in Quebec)
These resources offer confidential and anonymous support for individuals struggling with EDs, as well as their loved ones.

Relevant article for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.
Dr. Theresa Tam mentions that COVID-19 is still circulating at a "relatively high level" and other strains of influenza may surge.
She emphasizes the importance of vaccination, masking, and staying home when not feeling well to reduce risks.
The availability of antiviral drug Paxlovid can decrease the risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those who get sick.
Dr. Tam is eyeing a potential surge in COVID-19 cases during Australia's summer to predict what might happen in this hemisphere.
She highlights the need to track ICU admissions and deaths, as they are relatively low even when cases surge.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Current level of COVID-19 circulation
Availability of antiviral drug Paxlovid
Potential surge in other strains of influenza (e.g. H3N2, H1N1, Influenza B)
ICU admissions and deaths as a measure of severe outcomes

Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 5 days ago
Paxlovid reduces hospitalizations and deaths among high-risk individuals (e.g., seniors, immunocompromised).
Only 5,056 of 15,200 treatment courses have been dispensed in New Brunswick.
Eligibility criteria for Paxlovid include age 18, mild to moderate symptoms, and higher risk of severe outcomes (e.g., vaccination status, underlying health conditions).
Evusheld is a preventive treatment for high-risk individuals, but its effectiveness as a treatment is limited (5% benefit).

Title: 'Telling us we are not important': Lack of permanent paid sick days making health-care crisis worse, say experts
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 7 days ago
The article discusses the issue of a "two-tiered" system in Ontario's healthcare sector, where some workers are paid better and receive benefits like sick days, while others are low-wage and work on contract. The author argues that this system is unfair and puts essential workers at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several experts, including Dr. McKenzie, Maxwell Smith, and Dr. Naheed Dosani, are quoted in the article as emphasizing the importance of paid sick leave for healthcare workers. They argue that it's not only a matter of public health but also a human right to have access to adequate income, benefits, job security, and inclusive work environments.
The article cites several reports and studies, including one from the Wellesley Institute, which found that over 27,000 Ontario workers had been infected with COVID-19 on the job. Another report by the Decent Work and Health Network highlights the disproportionate impact of paid sick leave on essential workers, particularly those in low-wage and precarious work.
The experts also discuss the economic benefits of paid sick leave, including reducing absenteeism, preventing outbreaks, and protecting businesses from closures. They argue that providing safe working conditions for healthcare workers is crucial to recruiting new staff into the sector during a pandemic.
Some key points from the article include:
Over 27,000 Ontario workers had been infected with COVID-19 on the job.
Essential workers, particularly those in low-wage and precarious work, are disproportionately affected by paid sick leave.
Paid sick leave can reduce absenteeism, prevent outbreaks, and protect businesses from closures.
Healthcare workers are experiencing high levels of stress and burnout, with 86.5% reporting increased stress on the job during the pandemic.
There will be a shortage of 120,000 nurses in Ontario by 2030, highlighting the need for better working conditions to retain staff.
Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of paid sick leave and better working conditions for healthcare workers, particularly essential workers who are at high risk of infection.
