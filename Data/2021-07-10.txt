The delta variant is spreading rapidly and targeting unvaccinated individuals (key factor: vaccination status).

In Ontario, the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford, and Moderna vaccines all worked best after two doses.
The article highlights the importance of ensuring vaccines reach every Canadian who wants a shot to prevent delta-driven outbreaks and their potential ripple effect on fully vaccinated residents.

The study found that hospitalizations rose "significantly" between 2000 and 2012, from 159.7 opioid hospitalizations per million people to 325.3.
This information can be used as a reference point to understand the trend of hospitalization rates over time.
However, it does not provide direct relevance or values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada.

Title: Will we ever lock down again? Experts say it’s ‘unlikely,’ as pandemic finish line draws near - National

The article discusses the current state of COVID-19 in Canada, particularly in Ontario, where nearly 900 people are currently in intensive care units (ICUs). Experts warn that this small ICU capacity could become a problem as flu season approaches and hospitals face increased pressure.
Dr. Kieran Moore, the Chief Medical Officer of Health for Ontario, notes that while vaccines have been effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths, there are still some Canadians who cannot or will not get vaccinated. This includes children under 12, who do not yet have an approved vaccine available to them, and adults who choose not to get vaccinated.
Experts agree that a full return to normal is possible, but it will require a mindset shift as Canadians adjust to living with COVID-19. Dr. Zain Chakrabarti notes that vaccines have "defanged" the virus, making it less deadly for most people. He suggests that Canada should focus on addressing outbreaks among unvaccinated individuals rather than trying to stop every case of COVID-19.
Dr. Bogoch agrees that a full return to normal will happen and predicts that Canadians will soon be able to gather in large groups without fear of lockdowns. He notes that the vaccinated population will still get ill, but it will be much less severe compared to the unvaccinated.
Overall, the article suggests that while there are still some unknowns and challenges ahead, a full return to normal is possible as Canadians learn to live with COVID-19.
