Title: Globe editorial: Another wave of COVID-19 is coming. Why isn’t Canada preparing to beat it?
Publisher: The Globe and Mail
Posted: 2 days ago
Key points:
Another wave of COVID-19 is "almost baked in" this fall, according to Dr. Peter Juni.
The Public Health Agency of Canada has also warned of a potential resurgence of the disease.
Vaccination helps limit the impact of COVID-19 by reducing hospitalization and death rates.
2.5 million Canadian adults have never had a single dose of vaccine, including 225,000 in their 60s.
Low vaccination rates increase the risk of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.

Title: Interim statement on the use of additional booster doses of Emergency Use Listed mRNA vaccines against COVID-19
Publisher: World Health Organization (WHO)
Posted: 4 days ago
The text discusses the effectiveness of additional booster doses of mRNA vaccine against severe COVID-19, particularly for high-risk groups such as adults over 60 years old or those with immunocompromising conditions. The studies cited suggest that an additional booster dose may provide some short-term benefit in these populations, but the data are limited and do not support its use in healthy younger populations.
The key points from the text are:
1. Short-term benefit: Studies show a short-term benefit of an additional booster dose in high-risk groups, such as adults over 60 years old or those with immunocompromising conditions.
2. Limited data: Data to support an additional dose for healthy younger populations are limited, and preliminary data suggest minimal benefit.
3. Programmatic challenges: Administering an additional booster dose comes with considerable programmatic challenges in terms of vaccine delivery and financial costs.
4. Uncertainty about future variants: The emergence of new variants or sub-lineages raises uncertainty about the effectiveness of current vaccines against severe disease.
5. Need for updated vaccines: There is a need to develop pan-SARS-CoV-2 or pan-sarbecovirus vaccines, which may require updating the composition of current COVID-19 vaccines.
6. Importance of seasonality: Seasonality should be taken into account when planning catch-up campaigns and boosting for those at highest risk.
7. Need for more research: More research is needed on the performance of current and variant-specific candidate COVID-19 vaccines, including VE, immunogenicity, and safety.
The text concludes that while there may be some short-term benefit to an additional booster dose in high-risk groups, the data are limited, and programmatic challenges must be carefully weighed against the incremental benefit. The WHO position will be updated as more evidence becomes available.

Title: 5 more deaths, Horizon sees 39% jump in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, Vitalité sees 20% drop
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 4 days ago
Key values:
Number of active cases: Not directly reported, but can be inferred to be lower than New Brunswick's 1,593.
Hospitalization rates: Not explicitly stated, but can be estimated based on the number of outbreaks and occupied beds.
Vaccination rates: Can inform future hospitalization trends, with 52.2% of eligible New Brunswickers having received their booster dose.
Outbreaks in hospitals: Reported for New Brunswick, but not directly applicable to Ontario. However, they can provide insight into potential hospital capacity issues.
Health-care worker absences due to COVID-19: Not directly relevant to forecasting hospitalizations in Ontario, as the data is specific to New Brunswick.
These values can be used as a rough estimate or as a starting point for further analysis and modeling to forecast COVID-19 hospitalization trends in Ontario.

Title: Study: Readmission rate for COVID-19 is 11%
Publisher: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Posted: 5 days ago
5.5% of adults had a positive COVID-19 test during their hospital admission.
Median length of hospital stay was 8 days.
10.5% of patients with typical hospital stays (30 days or less) were readmitted or died within 30 days after discharge.
Patients who were readmitted or died were more likely to be older, male, discharged to a long-term care facility, and have a medical history of multiple hospitalizations.
95% of COVID-19 patients in Ontario were unvaccinated.
