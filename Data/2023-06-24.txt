Title: People hospitalized with COVID-19 face higher risk of serious health conditions: study
Publisher: The Globe and Mail

Relevant.
The article reports on a study analyzing health data of over 379,000 adults in Ontario, comparing hospitalizations due to COVID-19 with those due to influenza and sepsis. Key findings include:
Higher risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke, and depression/anxiety within the first 30 days after hospital discharge for COVID-19 patients.
No significant difference in long-term cardiovascular, neurologic, or mental-health conditions between COVID-19 and flu/sepsis patients.
Rates of these conditions are 2-5 times higher among people who have survived hospitalization for serious infections compared to the general population.
Values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada: 
Hospitalization rates, patient demographics (age, comorbidities), and time since last hospital discharge.

Title: Artificial intelligence-driven prediction of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death: a systematic review
Publisher: Frontiers

The references provided are a mix of research articles and reviews that explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for predicting mortality from COVID-19 in various settings, including Ontario, Canada.
Some key points from these references include:
The development and evaluation of AI-based models for predicting mortality from COVID-19 have been explored in several studies.
These models have shown promising results in terms of accuracy and predictive power.
Machine learning approaches, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, have been used to develop these models.
The performance of these models has been evaluated using metrics such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Brier score.
Some studies have also explored the use of ensemble methods, such as stacking and bagging, to improve the performance of AI-based models for predicting mortality from COVID-19.
Some specific findings from these references include:
A study published in Frontiers in Public Health found that a machine learning model developed using data from Ontario, Canada was able to predict mortality from COVID-19 with an accuracy of 92.5% [1].
Another study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that a machine learning-based clinical decision support system was able to predict early mortality from COVID-19 with an accuracy of 95.6% [3].
A review article published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine noted that AI-based models have shown promise in predicting mortality from COVID-19, but highlighted the need for further research and validation [11].
Overall, these references suggest that AI-based models can be effective tools for predicting mortality from COVID-19, and may have important implications for public health policy and practice.
