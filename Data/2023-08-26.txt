Relevant.
New COVID-19 vaccines targeting XBB.1.5 Omicron and its sub-lineages (EG.5.1 and FL.1.5.1) are being reviewed by Health Canada.
These new vaccines aim to provide better protection against the most recent virus variants causing hospitalizations across Canada.
The approval process is ongoing, but if approved, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends a dose of the new vaccine beginning this fall for authorized age groups at least six months after their most recent COVID-19 vaccine or known SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Title: COVID-19 cases in London, Ont., may soon rise but symptoms might be less intense, experts say
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
The Middlesex-London Health Unit expects a decrease in severity of symptoms and number of cases this year due to high vaccine uptake.
Wastewater data suggests an increase in positive samples, but at half the level compared to previous waves.
Hospital visits for COVID-19 have not increased significantly so far.
Annual COVID-19 boosters are recommended as the best defense against severe disease.
High-risk individuals (over 65, immunocompromised, and children under 5) will be prioritized for booster shots in late September to early October.

Key values:
Average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19: 34 (with 1 patient in ICU)

COVID-19 cases are rising in Canada after a period of decline, with 10 regions reporting an increase in activity (Aug. 22 data).
Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased by 19% between April 2022 and March 2023, with over 120,000 hospital stays.
Most patients were older (median age: 75), and the majority of emergency visits were completed within 25 hours.
The average length of stay in hospital increased to 20 days from 13 the previous year, and 13% of hospital stays included an ICU admission.

Title: COVID resurgence sparks concerns as hospitalizations increase across Canada
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 3 days ago
Key values:
11% increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in Canada on Aug. 15 compared to the week before
Median age of patients increased from 63 to 75 years old
Average length of stay at hospitals increased from 13 to 20 days
Mortality rate decreased by 1%
Decrease in emergency visits for COVID-19 (222,000 vs 262,000)

Title: Wastewater data indicates low-risk of COVID-19 surge this fall, according to Sudbury scientist
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 3 days ago
Key values:
EG.5 variant has been circulating in Canada since at least May.
Early evidence suggests EG.5 is no more severe but better able to evade front-line immune defences.
Public Health Sudbury and Districts (PHSD) plans to prioritize COVID-19 vaccinations for those at highest risk of complications or hospitalizations.
Ontario Ministry of Health updates vaccine guidance and recommendations based on new scientific information and NACI guidance.

Title: COVID-19 cases are ticking up in Toronto. Should you rush to get vaccinated?
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 4 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Positive COVID-19 tests and hospitalizations on the rise across Canada, with a small peak in Toronto.
Research shows that a majority of Canada's population has developed some level of immunity against the virus thanks to high rates of vaccination.
Health experts warn there is still potential for lasting health impacts from first or repeat infections such as long COVID, and new subvariants could still pose risks.
The BA.2.86 subvariant has caught attention due to its heavy mutations (over 30).
Hybrid immunity developed through prior vaccination and infection can reduce chances of developing severe illness, but antibodies can wane over time.
Booster shots are expected to shore up Canadians' immunity this fall, particularly against major subvariants of the virus (except possibly BA.2.86).

Title: Big data evidence of the impact of COVID-19 hospitalizations on mortality rates of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients

This text describes a statistical model used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID-19 ICU patients in Brazil. The model uses high-dimensional panel data estimation methods and controls for various factors that could influence the outcome, such as:
1. Proportion of ICU patients diagnosed with COVID-19: This is modeled using a cubic polynomial function to capture nonlinear spillover effects.
2. Sex and age: These are also modeled using cubic polynomials to capture sex-specific and nonlinear age affects.
3. Hospital size: The total number of ICU patients in each hospital and week is included as a control variable, as heavy hospital loads can increase mortality rates.
4. Postal code fixed effects: With over 21,000 postal codes available, this allows the model to absorb socioeconomic components of health demand, which are often correlated with COVID-19 outbreaks.
5. Hospital fixed effects: This controls for unobserved determinants of health outcomes that are specific to each hospital.
6. Epidemiological week fixed effect: This captures shocks common to all hospitals and patients in the system, such as changes in national public policy or infection waves.
7. Disease-specific fixed effects: With 1,508 ICD-10 diseases leading to intensive care represented, this allows the model to identify spillover effects isolating demand and supply factors associated with each disease.
The estimation method used is Sergio Correia's feasible estimator for high-dimensional fixed effects, which has advantages in processing times compared to alternative approaches. The model also accounts for correlation between observations at the hospital level using cluster-robust standard errors with hospital clustering.
Overall, this statistical model aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID-19 ICU patients in Brazil, controlling for various factors that could influence the outcome and accounting for the complexities of high-dimensional panel data.
