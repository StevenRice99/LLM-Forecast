Title: Blood tests could be early indicator of COVID-19 severity: study
Publisher: CTV News

Relevant.
Elevated neutrophil levels in blood tests can predict severity of COVID-19.
Patients with high neutrophil levels were more likely to require ICU care, ventilation, or die due to COVID-19.
Neutrophils are associated with inflammation and obesity, which increase risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Study found 5 proteins associated with neutrophils were elevated in patients who became critically ill.

Title: A Strategy for the Mass Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Based on Age and Neighbourhood
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 1 day ago
It appears that you've provided a detailed description of a modeling approach used to project COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in Ontario, Canada. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Model Components: 
1. Random Intercept Model: Used to account for variation between neighborhoods.
2. Penalized Spline: Applied to time to model the relationship between time and SARS-CoV-2 incidence.
3. Tensor Spline: Used to model the interaction between neighborhood risk and age on SARS-CoV-2 incidence.
Model Outputs: 
1. SARS-CoV-2 Incidence Deciles: Estimated using the random intercept model with a penalized spline for time.
2. Predicted Incidence: Calculated across 100 cells defined by neighborhood risk and age band, using a tensor spline for the interaction of neighborhood risk and age.
3. Logistic Count Regression Models: Developed to estimate the probability of COVID-19 hospitalization and death among SARS-CoV-2 cases.
Scenario-Based Projections: 
1. Control Scenario 1: Used as a baseline scenario with no changes in vaccine distribution.
2. Scenario 2: Assumed a linear increase in log(Rt) for traditional variants, followed by a decrease after the lockdown.
3. Scenario 3: Included an additional 40% transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant compared to traditional variants.
Assumptions: 
1. Linear Increase in Rt: For traditional variants between February 24 and March 10, 2021.
2. Lockdown Effect: A decrease in Rt for traditional variants starting on March 20, 2021.
3. B.1.1.7 Variant Transmissibility: 40% more transmissible than traditional variants.
4. Hospital Occupancy: 5.7% of daily active cases.
5. ICU Occupancy: 30.5% of hospital occupancy due to COVID-19.
6. Mortality Rates: 0.14% of daily active cases for traditional variants, with a 30% relative increase associated with the B.1.1.7 variant.
Projection Outputs: 
1. Cumulative Incidence Curves: Derived for deaths, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and SARS-CoV-2 cases between March 1 and May 31, 2021.
2. Daily Estimates: Calculated for incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospital occupancy, and deaths from COVID-19.

Title: Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on Feb. 22
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 4 days ago
Here are some key points from the article:
The UK is slowly easing its lockdown restrictions, with schools reopening on March 8 and people allowed to meet one friend or relative outdoors.
Pubs, restaurants, and hairdressers will reopen on April 12, but only outdoors.
Indoor venues such as theatres and cinemas are scheduled to open on May 17, along with limited crowds returning to sports stadiums.
The final stage of the plan, in which all legal limits on social conduct are removed, is set for June 21.
Germany has reopened elementary schools and kindergartens in more than half of its states, despite a flattening out of case numbers.
New Zealand will remove remaining coronavirus restrictions from Auckland after an outbreak fades.
India's Serum Institute has asked foreign governments to be patient with their vaccine supply, saying they have been directed to prioritize India's requirements.
Japan will only receive limited doses of vaccines for the first months of the rollout and shots for the elderly will be distributed gradually.
The Philippines and Thailand have approved Sinovac Biotech's vaccine for emergency use.
Argentina has authorized the emergency use of Sinopharm's vaccine ahead of an expected delivery of one million doses.
Israel has reopened swaths of its economy, including malls and leisure facilities, after vaccines were administered to almost half the population.
South Africa remains the hardest-hit country in Africa, with over 1.5 million reported cases of COVID-19 and over 49,000 recorded deaths.
Overall, the article highlights the slow and cautious approach being taken by many countries as they try to balance the need to reopen their economies with the ongoing risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Title: The speech pathologists helping COVID-19 patients learn how to swallow and speak again
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 5 days ago
This article discusses the challenges faced by patients who have been intubated for COVID-19 and are struggling to recover their ability to swallow and communicate after being extubated. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) play a crucial role in helping these patients regain their faculties, but their work is often unseen by the general public.
The article highlights several key points:
1. Dysphagia is common: Many COVID-19 patients experience difficulty swallowing, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia and other complications.
2. SLPs are essential: SLPs help patients communicate with healthcare teams and family members while working on their assessment of the patient's swallowing abilities.
3. Challenges in testing: Due to the risk of aerosolizing the virus, SLPs cannot use endoscopy tests to assess swallowing issues in COVID-19 patients.
4. Long recovery process: Patients may require ongoing speech therapy, either as an outpatient or through a rehabilitation clinic.
5. Research is needed: There is a lack of data on dysphagia during the pandemic, and more research is needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on swallowing function.
The article also features interviews with two SLPs, Winer and Skoretz, who share their experiences working with patients who have been intubated for COVID-19. They highlight the importance of their work in helping patients recover from severe illnesses and the need for more research to improve rehabilitation outcomes.

Relevant.
Summary: The article discusses how COVID-19 lockdowns and hygiene protocols may have unintended consequences on human microbiomes, potentially leading to increased rates of conditions like asthma, diabetes, and brain diseases. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada are not mentioned directly, but the article highlights the importance of considering long-term impacts on human health and potential social inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes.
