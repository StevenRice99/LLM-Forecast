Title: The toll COVID-19 is taking on Canada's homeless
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the challenges faced by Canada's homeless population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need for increased housing and support services to address this issue.
Key points:
The number of people experiencing homelessness in Canada has decreased over time, but advocates believe this is due to increased testing rather than a decrease in homelessness.
A community survey found that 93% of organizations working with homeless individuals reported reasonable access to COVID-19 testing for symptomatic clients.
However, the ultimate solution lies in getting people off the streets and into affordable housing, which requires changes to government policy and investment in housing initiatives.
The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness (CAEH) estimates that up to 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness each year, with as many as 35,000 people in shelters on any given night.
Advocates are calling for the launch of initiatives similar to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides temporary income support to Canadians who have lost their source of income due to COVID-19.
The CAEH also suggests that the government consider guaranteed minimum income across the country, in addition to greater investment in housing and protection of the rental housing market from financialization.
The article highlights the need for increased housing and support services to address homelessness in Canada. Some specific examples include:
The City of Toronto's program to move people out of congregate living situations and into hotel rooms and apartments.
British Columbia's efforts to provide housing and smartphones to those experiencing homelessness.
Winnipeg's new community COVID-19 testing site for the homeless population.
Overall, the article emphasizes that addressing homelessness in Canada requires a comprehensive approach that includes increased housing and support services, as well as changes to government policy.
