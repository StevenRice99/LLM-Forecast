Title: Public health risk profile: Wildfires in Canada, 2023
Publisher: Canada.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
This document appears to be a risk profile for public health risks associated with wildfires in Canada. Here's a summary of its key points:
Current Impact 
The current impact of evacuations on the well-being of people living in Canada is unknown due to lack of data.
There is moderate uncertainty about the impacts of evacuations on mental health, well-being, and social stability, particularly for equity-deserving populations.
Contextual Factors Affecting Risk 
Climate change will increase the frequency, duration, severity, and season length of wildfires, leading to increased exposure to wildfire smoke and evacuations.
Individuals with disabilities may face unique challenges during evacuation and displacement.
The long-term impacts of wildfires on socially or economically marginalized populations are significant and require further review.
Risk Factors 
Heat is often correlated with wildfires, which may interact with wildfire smoke or evacuation exposures and affect impacts.
Wildfire smoke can impact air quality in multiple communities across geographic locations.
Downstream impacts from wildfires, such as industrial area contamination, may increase risk.
Collaboration between organizations and departments at all government levels is required to support health priorities.
Limitations and Knowledge Gaps 
The risk profile has several limitations, including:
+ Limited understanding of factors leading to differential wildfire smoke or evacuation exposure and impact.
+ Lack of information on specific populations susceptible to wildfire smoke or evacuations.
+ Insufficient data on the longer-term impacts of wildfires on physical, mental, social, or cultural health and safety.
+ Limited knowledge on the effectiveness of mitigating measures and equity impacts.
Recommendations 
Public health authorities can use this risk profile to prepare for, respond to, and communicate about acute public health risks associated with the 2023 Canadian wildfire season.
Next steps include:
+ Improving understanding of factors leading to differential exposure and impact.
+ Gathering more information on specific populations susceptible to wildfire smoke or evacuations.
+ Conducting further research on the longer-term impacts of wildfires.
Overall, this risk profile highlights the need for improved understanding and preparedness for public health risks associated with wildfires in Canada.

Low community transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses in Toronto.
Only 36 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Toronto last week, down from double that number the month prior.
Mandatory masking requirement still in place in patient rooms, waiting areas where patients are present, emergency departments, and areas caring for immunocompromised individuals.

Title: Wastewater surveillance highlights significant underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Canada
Publisher: News-Medical.Net
Posted: 5 days ago
Key findings:
Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 loads correlated with COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
Correlations were strongest on the sampling date or one day after sampling.
The highest correlation between wastewater viral loads and hospitalizations occurred four days after sampling.
A linear regression model predicted a 6.5- to 18.7-fold underestimation of COVID-19 cases at the peak of the fifth and sixth waves, respectively.
