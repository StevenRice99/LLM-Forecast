The study was conducted on adults aged 50+ years in Ontario, Canada.
The effectiveness of monovalent and bivalent mRNA vaccines against severe Omicron-related outcomes was evaluated.
The study found that both types of vaccines offer effective initial protection (VE: 85-88%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization or mortality among adults aged 50+ years.
The VE was slightly higher during the BA.4/BA.5-predominant period compared to the BQ-predominant period.
Additional vaccine doses would benefit older adults the most, as they experience the highest rates of severe outcomes related to COVID-19.
