Title: Convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients with COVID-19: an open-label, randomized controlled trial
Publisher: Nature.com

No difference in intubation or death at 30d between convalescent plasma and standard of care.
Antibody content had a significant effect-modifying role on the outcome, with high levels of neutralizing antibodies associated with reduced risk and high levels of non-functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies associated with increased risk.
Serious adverse events were more frequent in the convalescent plasma group (33.4% vs 26.4%).
The study suggests caution against unrestricted use of convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 3 days ago
The text discusses strategies to minimize the risk of opioid-related harm during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. The key points are:
1. Community outreach services: Can increase engagement and decrease barriers to access for people who use drugs (PWUD).
2. Integrate COVID-19 safety protocols: Into addiction and harm reduction services to ensure safe operation and minimize risk of closure or reduced capacity.
3. Less restrictive OAT regulations: Increase access to opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and other health services within shelters and temporary emergency shelter settings.
4. Address stigma in the healthcare system: To improve access to care for PWUD.
5. Deal with upstream social determinants of health (SDOH): Such as homelessness, lack of long-term affordable housing, and poverty.
6. Monitor indicators of opioid harm: To assess the effectiveness of strategies and adapt them as needed.
The text also highlights gaps in provincial data capabilities related to measuring disparities for populations disproportionately impacted by the opioid crisis, such as racialized or marginalized communities. It emphasizes the need for ongoing investment in the Ontario opioid data infrastructure and collaboration with community stakeholders and individuals with lived experience.
Key terms:
PWUD: People who use drugs
OAT: Opioid agonist treatment
SDOH: Social determinants of health
