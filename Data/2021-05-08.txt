Title: Remdesivir for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 2 days ago
The text describes the use of remdesivir in treating COVID-19, based on a scientific brief from Ontario, Canada.
Key Findings: 
1. Remdesivir reduced mortality and improved outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
2. The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality was 0.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96), indicating an absolute risk reduction of 2.3%.
3. Remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 2 days, and reduced hospital length of stay by 5 days.
4. Serious adverse events were lower in patients receiving remdesivir compared to placebo or usual care.
Recommendations: 
1. Critically Ill Patients: Remdesivir is not recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO.
2. Moderately Ill Patients: Remdesivir 200 mg day 1 then 100 mg daily for 4 days is recommended for moderately ill patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
3. Mildly Ill Patients: Remdesivir is not recommended for mildly ill patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
Practical Considerations: 
1. There is a limited supply of remdesivir in Ontario, and clinicians should be selective about using the drug only when it is needed.
2. Clinicians are encouraged to follow evidence-based principles in prescribing remdesivir, similar to strategies for tocilizumab.
