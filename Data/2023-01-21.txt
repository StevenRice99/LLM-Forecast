Title: Lockdown: A Final Assessment
Publisher: Fraser Institute
Posted: 2 days ago
Key findings:
Epidemiological models that do not account for human behavior changes overestimate hospitalization and death numbers.
Lockdowns had a small positive effect on mortality rates (3.2% reduction).
The costs of lockdowns go beyond lost GDP, including food insecurity, trade reductions, increased domestic violence, mental health issues, employment disruptions, and collateral deaths from missed medical checkups.
Collateral deaths from missed medical checkups may have exceeded the number of lives saved by lockdowns (171,000 vs 27,303).

Title: Her first bout with COVID-19 came in September. Nearly 4 months later Janine Hopkins still has symptoms
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 2 days ago
15% of people who contracted COVID-19 experienced lingering symptoms (long COVID).
A clinic in Thunder Bay, St. Joseph's Care Group, has been operating a post-COVID Clinic since July 2021.
The clinic is accessed by referral from a primary care provider and is for people over 18 with unresolved symptoms for more than 4 weeks.
Wait times for the clinic can be up to 4 months, but those with most urgent needs are seen first.

Title: Proposal to mostly ban tobogganing in Oshawa, Ont. parks draws criticism
Publisher: Canadian Underwriter
Posted: 2 days ago
The article reports on a proposal to ban tobogganing at most municipal parks in Oshawa, Ont. However, the relevant information for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations is:
Between April 2020 and March 2021, there were 80 tobogganning hospitalizations recorded in Ontario.
Tobogganing accounted for 1.4% of all reported sport and winter hospitalizations in Ontario during that period.
Skiing and snowboard injuries led to 325 hospitalizations, 17 times more than tobogganing.

Title: Real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron BA.2 variant in a SARS-CoV-2 infection-naive population
Publisher: Nature.com
Posted: 3 days ago
The text discusses a study on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in Hong Kong during the Omicron BA.2 wave. The authors highlight several limitations and uncertainties in their analysis:
1. Estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, severe disease, and death: The introduction of oral antivirals in February 2022 made it difficult to estimate VE against these outcomes.
2. Representativeness of the study population: The analysis was based on seroprevalence among blood donors and voluntary child participants, which might not be representative of the general population.
3. Limited data on oral antiviral usage: The authors lacked comprehensive data on oral antiviral usage in Hong Kong, making it challenging to estimate VE against severe disease and death.
4. Small number of CoronaVac vaccinees: The small sample size led to substantial uncertainty in VE estimates for the CoronaVac vaccine.
5. Limited data on heterologous vaccinations: The authors were unable to estimate VE conferred by heterologous vaccinations (e.g., CoronaVac with BNT162b2 boosters).
6. Sensitivity of seropositivity threshold: The study's positive controls might not be sensitive enough to detect individuals with asymptomatic or very mild infections, potentially underestimating infection-acquired resistance (IAR).
7. Limited data on VE waning due to variant emergence: The authors were unable to estimate further accelerated VE waning due to the emergence of later variants like BA.4/BA.5.
Despite these limitations, the study found that:
Booster vaccination using either mRNA or inactivated vaccine was effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 infection.
Surge booster campaigns could be strategically used to rapidly boost population immunity before upcoming waves of infections.
The comparatively lower IAR in Hong Kong highlights the effect of supplementing vaccination campaigns with continued public health and social measures in disease transmission.
The authors conclude that frequently updated studies are necessary to quantify the protective effect of repeated booster vaccination, including with new bivalent COVID-19 vaccines, for policymakers to develop effective booster vaccination strategies.

Title: Flu cases down, COVID-19 activity on the rise: Toronto Public Health
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 5 days ago
COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in Toronto, with a 17% positivity rate as of Jan 10.
The rolling weekly incidence rate of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases is 52 per 100,000 residents.
Severe outcomes such as hospitalization and ICU admission are still low.
The most transmissible COVID-19 variant XBB.1.5 is spreading quickly in the US and Europe, but levels in Ontario remain low.
Vaccination campaigns have been focused on those with increased risk to the virus, with 73% of Torontonians 60+ having received a booster.
