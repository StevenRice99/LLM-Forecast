Title: Spring wave of COVID-19? Be prepared Canada, experts warn
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 2 days ago
Wastewater data shows a "sustained increase" in viral signal in various locations across Ontario.
Experts warn of potential rise in cases and hospitalizations due to easing of public health measures and emergence of Omicron subvariant BA.2.
Immunization rates are expected to blunt the impacts of BA.2, but decreased public health vigilance could clear a path for increased infections and hospitalizations.
Uptake of third vaccine doses is lagging behind first and second doses, which may impact protection against severe outcomes from Omicron infection.
Experts suggest that vaccination is only somewhat efficient at protecting against infection, particularly when caused by the Omicron variant.

Current daily case counts are levelling off nationally, but still high (15,000 to 20,000 estimated infections).
Wastewater surveillance shows increasing concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario and other provinces.
BA.2 subvariant is expected to become the dominant strain in Canada, spreading 30% more easily than previous variants.
Hospital occupancy is expected to rise, but not to crushing levels seen earlier in the pandemic.
Communities with lower vaccination rates, crowded housing, or multi-generational homes are at higher risk of household transmission and dire outcomes.
