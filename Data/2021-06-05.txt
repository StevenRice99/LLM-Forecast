Title: Lessons Learned from Israel’s Reopening During a Nationwide COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign
Publisher: Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table
Posted: 4 days ago
The article discusses Israel's approach to reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential applicability to other jurisdictions, such as Ontario in Canada. Key points include:
Israel's Green Pass and Purple Badge standard: 
The Green Pass was a digital certificate that required individuals to show proof of vaccination or COVID-19 recovery to enter certain establishments, such as restaurants, hotels, gyms, and public transportation.
The Purple Badge standard ensured that customers, employees, and employers in non-essential workplaces and retail stores could operate safely without requiring proof of vaccination or COVID-19 recovery.
Removal of Green Pass and Purple Badge requirements: 
Both the Green Pass and Purple Badge standards were officially removed on June 1, 2021, as SARS-CoV-2 infection numbers were low (17 new cases) and COVID-19 vaccine coverage was high.
The only remaining public health measure is indoor masking.
Israel's vaccine rollout and uptake success: 
Factors contributing to Israel's successful vaccine rollout and uptake include:
+ Simple prioritization process
+ Effective communication to instill vaccine confidence
+ Digital infrastructure and penetration of smartphone apps
+ Small geographical area and population size
Concerns related to equity and privacy: 
The Green Pass approach may exacerbate existing social inequities, particularly for those who lack access to technological devices.
Community engagement, trust building, and targeted information are needed to address concerns of groups who are vaccine hesitant.
Privacy concerns have been noted with the Green Pass insofar as those checking credentials have access to private health information.
Applicability to Ontario: 
Applying Israel's phased reopening strategy, aligned with improving epidemiological indicators, increasing vaccine uptake, and maintaining key public health measures could inform Ontario's approach.
Other promising practices to consider include the Green Pass approach, which can incentivize vaccine uptake, emphasize outdoor activities, and support a safe return to social and communal events in the arts and recreation.
Key differences between Israel and Ontario: 
Population size (Israel has 9.3 million people, while Ontario has approximately 14.7 million)
Land area (Israel is about 0.02% of Ontario's land area)
Vaccine supply and access
Digital infrastructure (centralized in Israel)
Timing of the second dose (with Israel insisting on 2-doses per protocol within 3 weeks)
