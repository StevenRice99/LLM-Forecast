Here are some key points from the article:
A new study by University of Oxford researchers found that receiving a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine significantly increased the immune response to the Omicron variant.
The study compared antibody levels in blood samples from people who received two doses of vaccine with samples from those who received a third dose, and found that levels of neutralizing antibodies rose sharply after a third dose.
U.S. health regulators authorized the second pill against COVID-19, Merck's molnupiravir, which is expected to have a smaller role in battling the pandemic due to its limited ability to head off severe COVID-19 (30% effectiveness) and potential safety issues.
The FDA also cleared Pfizer's Paxlovid as a treatment for COVID-19, which is likely to become the first-choice treatment against the virus due to its superior benefits and milder side effects.
As of early Thursday, more than 277.9 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, with over 5.3 million deaths.
The Middle East has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases, with the UAE reporting 1,000 new infections on Thursday.
Ecuador is making vaccination mandatory, while the U.S. Supreme Court will hold a special session to weigh challenges to two Biden administration policies covering vaccine requirements for millions of workers.
Hospitals in South Carolina are concerned about an Omicron surge worsening staffing crunches among doctors, nurses, and other frontline workers.
Thailand has detained an Israeli tourist who broke out of quarantine while apparently infected with the Omicron variant.
South Korea set a new record for daily COVID-19 deaths as it struggles to resolve a shortage of hospital beds amid weeks of surging cases.
Two countries in the Balkan region, Albania and Serbia, have reported their first two cases of the Omicron variant.
The UK has broken its daily record with 100,000 new cases, while Italy is planning to tighten restrictions to try to curb a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections.

Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
As of Thursday, Ottawa had 2,800 known active COVID-19 cases and only 6 residents were being treated for COVID-19 in a city hospital.
In the Kingston area, there were 24 people in hospital with COVID-19 as of Tuesday, but this is lower than previous numbers.

Title: Omicron is blurring true picture of COVID-19 cases. But experts say there are other ways to capture it
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: 3 days ago
The article discusses the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Canada and its potential impact on hospitals. While early data suggests that Omicron may cause milder symptoms, experts warn that the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm healthcare systems.
Key points from the article include:
Hospitalizations are a more robust metric for tracking the pandemic's impact than community spread through testing.
The current threat to hospitals comes from those who have never been vaccinated or infected with COVID-19.
Early data suggests that Omicron may cause milder symptoms, but there are caveats to this early data, including that it may be hitting younger people and more people may have some level of immunity.
Experts warn that the rapid spread of Omicron could still overwhelm healthcare systems, even if cases are mild.
Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam advises Canadians to reduce contacts over the holidays to prevent huge numbers of patients from winding up in hospital with COVID-19.
Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of taking precautions and being aware of the potential impact of Omicron on healthcare systems and society as a whole.

Quebec's Omicron variant cases are expected to lead to a significant increase in hospitalizations (up to 250 admissions per day).
The province's hospital capacity is reduced due to staff shortages.
Unvaccinated individuals represent 50% of hospitalizations and getting vaccinated could halve the number of hospitalizations.
A report by INESSS suggests that government measures could impact the expected number of hospitalizations (up to 1,000 people in hospital with COVID-19 by Jan. 10).
The article highlights the importance of vaccination, self-isolation, and reducing contacts to prevent the spread of the virus.
