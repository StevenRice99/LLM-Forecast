This text appears to be a research study on the health disparities among visible minority groups in Canada, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's a summary of the key points:
Data Sources: 
Provincial and territorial vital statistical offices
2016 Census profile tables
Dissemination areas (DAs) with an average population of 400 to 700 persons
Methodology: 
Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for each neighbourhood at national, provincial, and Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) levels.
The death database was linked to the dissemination area population using the PCCF+ file.
Aggregated population from the Census of Population 2016 was used to calculate age-standardized rates.
Definitions: 
Visible minority groups include South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Arab, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean, and Japanese.
Age-standardization method used to standardize rates to the 2011 Census of Population with five-year age groupings.
References: 
The study cites several sources, including:
Research articles on COVID-19 health disparities among ethnic minorities and immigrants
Studies on economic impact of COVID-19 among visible minority groups
Reports on racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes
Limitations: 
The data used are provisional due to reporting delays.
The capacity of provincial and territorial vital statistical offices to provide data varies greatly.
Overall, this study aims to investigate health disparities among visible minority groups in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.
