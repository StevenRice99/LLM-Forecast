Title: Wastewater now 'one of our only reliable tools' to detect COVID-19 prevalence
Publisher: CTV News
Posted: 1 day ago
The article discusses the use of wastewater surveillance to monitor COVID-19 levels in communities across Canada. Experts from various provinces, including Alberta, Ontario, and British Columbia, share their insights on the challenges and limitations of this approach.
Key points:
1. Wastewater surveillance: The process involves analyzing wastewater samples for SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, which can indicate the presence of COVID-19 in a community.
2. Challenges and limitations: Experts highlight several factors that can affect the accuracy of wastewater data, including variations in water usage patterns, precipitation, and industrial contributions to municipal wastewater.
3. Comparing levels between cities or health regions: This comparison is not recommended due to differences in wastewater systems and variables between communities.
4. Establishing trends: The focus should be on determining whether COVID-19 levels are increasing or decreasing rather than trying to determine an absolute concentration.
5. Converting wastewater signal into actual case numbers: This conversion is scientifically difficult, as it's not known how much virus individuals shed through their feces or whether these amounts differ based on the severity of their infection.
6. Future forecasts: Experts expect COVID-19 levels in Ontario and British Columbia to continue rising, but they cannot predict how high or for how long.
The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of engaging with wastewater data as a tool to inform public choices about living with COVID-19.

Title: Paxlovid ‘inaccessible’ to many patients in Canada. Here’s why that needs to change - National
Publisher: Global News
Posted: 3 days ago
Here's a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Paxlovid has shown a 90% reduction in hospitalizations among unvaccinated patients with the Delta variant who received the drug within 5 days of symptom onset.
Ontario had a centralized distribution system until it allowed select pharmacies to distribute the drug to those who have a prescription.
Hospitalizations and intensive care unit capacities have been key drivers for public health measures in past COVID-19 waves in Ontario.
The province is now in its sixth wave, driven by the lifting of public health measures, and hospitalizations are rising.

42% of hospitalizations occurred in Ontario.
Children aged 2-4 years and 12-17 years had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 (49% and 41%, respectively).
Neurologic and pulmonary disorders, technology dependence, and premature births were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19.
ICU admissions and hemodynamic or pulmonary support requirements varied by age group.

Title: Scientists, doctors try to fill gaps in COVID-19 risk information amid decrease in reliable data
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: 5 days ago
Key values:
PCR testing has dropped significantly, causing underestimations of official case counts.
The Omicron variant fuels soaring COVID-19 cases.
Hospitalizations, COVID deaths, test positivity rate, and estimated daily cases are being used to calculate the risk level in every province and territory.
A "local COVID-19 risk index" is being developed by Peterborough's public health unit, which incorporates local case rates, hospitalizations, deaths, wastewater surveillance, PCR test positivity, and rapid antigen test positivity.

Title: A refresher into Paxlovid, Pfizer's antiviral COVID-19 treatment
Publisher: CityNews Toronto
Posted: 5 days ago
Here is a brief summary highlighting values most important for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada:
Paxlovid (Pfizer's antiviral treatment) can reduce hospitalization by 90% if given within 3 days of infection and 85% if administered within 5 days.
The treatment is effective against high-risk patients, including those aged 70+ or immunocompromised.
Ontario has expanded eligibility for antiviral treatments to include individuals aged 18+, with certain risk conditions, regardless of vaccination status.
