Who is most at risk? 
Children under the age of one
Those who haven't been vaccinated against the flu or chickenpox
Immunocompromised people
Those with skin conditions that can allow bacteria to enter the body, such as uncontrolled eczema
What are symptoms to watch out for in kids? 
Trouble breathing
Fever
Significant change in personality
Fatigue
Stiff neck
A full-body rash
Not able to eat or drink
No longer urinating
How can people protect themselves and children? 
Proper hand washing before eating and after coughing or sneezing
Watching for skin infections
Coughing or sneezing into a tissue or into their bent elbow, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects.
What are the symptoms of iGAS in adults? 
High fever
Difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Confusion
Widespread reddening of the skin
Is iGAS circulating in Canada right now? 
Yes, there have been confirmed cases of iGAS in Canada since mid-November.
However, it is not clear if this is a significant increase or just a normal part of the annual circulation of the bacteria.

Title: A senior says she ended up in the ER after being denied the COVID treatment Paxlovid
Publisher: CBC News
Posted: 1 day ago
Key values:
Paxlovid treatment reduces incidence of hospitalization and death.
Eligibility criteria: patients over 60 qualify for Paxlovid prescription; younger people can access if immunocompromised or high-risk.
Supply is not an issue (1.5 million courses ordered).
Only a small percentage of distributed courses have been used (e.g., Saskatchewan: 6%).
Ontario recently allowed pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid, potentially increasing accessibility and reducing hospitalizations.

Title: Nursing home wait list hits record high — and is now holding up 500 hospital beds
Publisher: CBC.ca
Posted: 1 day ago
The number of seniors waiting for nursing home beds in New Brunswick has reached a record high (833 people), with nearly 500 waiting in hospital beds.
This situation increases the strain on the hospital system due to the triple threat of respiratory illnesses (flu, RSV, and COVID-19).
The article highlights the importance of addressing the root cause of hospital bed shortages, such as staff shortages and inefficient assessment processes, rather than just building new nursing homes.
The cost of keeping seniors in hospital beds is high ($800-$1,000 per day), while alternative care options like special care homes are available but expensive ($5,000-$6,000 per month).
The article suggests that forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada should consider the broader context of healthcare system capacity and resource allocation.

Title: Why are children across Canada getting so sick this year?
Publisher: CityNews Toronto
Posted: 4 days ago
Relevant.
The article suggests an immunity gap as a significant factor in the high number of children hospitalized with common respiratory viruses, such as RSV and Influenza. Key values for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada include:
Immunity gap due to social distancing and masking measures
Overlapping seasons of RSV and flu, increasing co-infections
Potential impact of COVID-19 infections on children's immune systems
Low vaccination rates against influenza (less than 1/4 kids vaccinated)
Seasonality of RSV and flu, with a potential end to the season at some point.

Title: Ontario to allow pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid for COVID-19
Publisher: CityNews Toronto
Posted: 5 days ago
Relevant.
The article is relevant for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario, Canada. Key points include:
Pharmacists can now prescribe Paxlovid to eligible patients at no cost, starting Dec 12.
Eligible individuals include those 60+, immunocompromised, and those with chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.
The goal is to reduce COVID-19-related hospital admissions by increasing access to treatment within 5 days of symptom onset.

Title: Why using the term ‘immunity debt’ is problematic for reporters
Publisher: Association of Health Care Journalists
Posted: 5 days ago
Relevant.
The article highlights that:
The current caseload of flu, RSV, and COVID-19 infections is due to delayed exposure to pathogens, not weakened immune systems.
Social distancing and masking measures temporarily held off infections, which are now occurring as population behavior allows the greater spread of pathogens.
Most children have RSV infections multiple times throughout childhood, conferring weak immunity.
The "debt" refers to the lack of infections due to simple lack of exposure to pathogens at all.

Booster rates among seniors are low, with only about a third getting the shot.
Hospital admissions for seniors with COVID-19 have surpassed those during previous omicron waves in some states.
